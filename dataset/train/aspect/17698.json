{"Lack of confirmed cases in Mississippi": "The expert's verdict mentions that as of March 3, there are no confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Mississippi, according to the Mississippi State Department of Health website. This contradicts the claim that the coronavirus has made it to Mississippi.", "Main modes of transmission": "The expert explains that according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the virus is thought to spread mainly from person to person, either through close contact or through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes. This contradicts the claim that the virus is airborne and can be transmitted through wind.", "Possibility of transmission through talking": "The expert mentions that talking, especially when saying words with the letters \"t\" or \"d,\" can spread respiratory droplets that can cause infection when they come into contact with someone's mucous membranes. This supports the claim that the virus can be transmitted through respiratory droplets, but it does not necessarily mean it is airborne.", "Hypothesized airborne transmission": "The expert explains that while airborne transmission of the virus has not been documented, it has been hypothesized to occur. This suggests that there is ongoing research and speculation about the possibility of the virus being airborne, but it is not yet confirmed."}
