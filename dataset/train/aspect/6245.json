{"Lack of evidence": "The expert's verdict highlights that the claim lacks supporting evidence. The sources cited by William Murray, the person behind the ad, did not refer to the issue of courts and domestic law. This lack of evidence undermines the authenticity of the claim.", "Legal precedents": "The expert mentions two legal precedents that contradict the claim. Firstly, the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals struck down an Oklahoma law that blocked state courts from considering or using Sharia law, deeming it unconstitutional. Secondly, in a Kansas divorce case, the court allowed the property division to be based on a marriage contract in accordance with Sharia law. These legal precedents suggest that the claim of Obama forcing courts to accept Sharia law is unfounded.", "Separation of powers": "The expert explains that even if the Obama administration were pushing for Sharia law, the executive branch does not have the power to force courts to accept any particular law. The separation of powers outlined in the Constitution and established court precedent prevent the executive branch from imposing a specific law on the courts. This aspect further discredits the claim.", "Expert consensus": "The expert's verdict is supported by other legal experts, including Glenn Hendrix, a managing partner in a law firm and past chair of the American Bar Association's section on International Law. Hendrix confirms that there is no substance to the claim and emphasizes that the Constitution and court precedent take precedence over religious law. The consensus among legal experts strengthens the argument against the authenticity of the claim."}
