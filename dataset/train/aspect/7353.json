{"The claim is based on an estimate provided by the organization Oregonians for Immigration Reform": "OFIR), which relies on a report by the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR). This aspect verifies the source of the claim and the methodology used to calculate the estimated cost to taxpayers.", "The estimate includes the cost of government services to undocumented immigrants and their children": "with schooling costs making up approximately half of the total. This aspect verifies the specific components included in the estimated cost and provides a breakdown of how the cost is distributed.", "The estimate also takes into account the contributions made by undocumented immigrants through taxes": "including gas, property, income, and tobacco taxes. This aspect verifies that the estimate considers both the costs and benefits associated with undocumented immigrants.", "The estimate is criticized by other organizations": "such as the Immigration Policy Center and Competitive Enterprise Institute, who argue that it inflates the economic harm caused by undocumented immigrants and unfairly includes the costs of educating and providing healthcare for U.S.-born children.
