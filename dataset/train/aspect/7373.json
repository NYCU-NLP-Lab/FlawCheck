{"The expert": "s verdict highlights that Donald Trump's claim of there being \"at least 2 million criminal aliens\" in the country is inaccurate. The expert references a Department of Homeland Security report from 2013 which estimates that there are 1.9 million removable criminal aliens in the United States, but it does not specify how many of them are living in the country illegally.", "The expert also notes that the term": "criminal alien\" encompasses any noncitizen who has been convicted of a crime in the United States, regardless of their legal status. This means that the 1.9 million figure includes both legal and illegal immigrants who have committed crimes.", "The Migration Policy Institute": "s report from July 2015 is cited by the expert, which estimates that out of the 1.9 million removable criminal aliens, approximately 820,000 are living in the United States illegally. Furthermore, it states that around 690,000 of these individuals would be considered priorities for removal, as they have been convicted of a felony or serious misdemeanor.", "The expert also mentions that Donald Trump": "s claim about illegal immigration costing the country over $113 billion a year is based on a study by the Federation for American Immigration, which includes the cost of public education and healthcare for U.S.-born children of immigrants who came to the country illegally."}
