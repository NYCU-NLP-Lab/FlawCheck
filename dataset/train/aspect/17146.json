In 2016, 18% of people were aged 65 and over, and it is predicted that by 2046, almost 25% of the population will be over 65. This data further supports the claim of an aging population.", "The data on the decline in the proportion of young people in the population": "from 25% in 1976 to 19% in 2016, also supports the claim of an aging population.
