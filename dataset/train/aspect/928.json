{"The claim falsely states that President Trump": "immediately dropped our sanctions against Russia\" after his election.", "President Trump did not drop the sanctions implemented by President Obama in response to the cyberattack": "These sanctions included measures against Russian intelligence agencies, officers, and companies, as well as the closure of Russian compounds and the removal of intelligence operatives.", "Some Democrats": "including Nancy Pelosi, inaccurately claimed that Trump was \"lifting sanctions\" on a Russian intelligence agency. However, the change referred to was an adjustment by the Treasury Department to authorize the import of information technology products into Russia.", "Months into his presidency": "Trump signed a law that codified Obama's election-related sanctions and introduced mandates for future sanctions. The law also requires congressional review if the president attempts to lift such sanctions, and Trump signed it reluctantly, considering it \"significantly flawed.\" Additionally, Trump's former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, pleaded guilty to lying about a conversation with the Russian ambassador regarding the sanctions."}
