{"Lack of appearance at political candidate debates": "The claim states that Lamar Smith has never once appeared at a moderated debate to defend his positions on the issues. This aspect is supported by the press release issued by Matt McCall, where he accuses Smith of dodging debates.", "Confirmation from campaign consultant": "In response to the inquiry, Smith's campaign consultant, Jordan Berry, stated that Smith and McCall had appeared together. This suggests that Smith did participate in some form of public discussion or event with McCall.", "Photo evidence": "The expert mentions a photo on McCall's website showing McCall speaking with Smith in 2013. However, it is clarified that the photo was taken at a lunch meeting of the Central Texas Republican Assembly and not at a debate. This aspect supports the claim that Smith did not participate in debates.", "Confirmation from the Central Texas Republican Assembly": "The president of the Central Texas Republican Assembly, T.J. Scott, confirms that Smith was invited to appear at their regular meetings but scheduling conflicts prevented his attendance. This further supports the claim that Smith did not participate in debates, as his absence was due to scheduling conflicts."}
