{"The claim is based on hacked emails published by WikiLeaks": "specifically the emails of John Podesta, the campaign chairman for Hillary Clinton. This verifies the source of the claim.", "The claim originates from a conspiracy theory known as Pizzagate": "which alleges that Clinton and her allies are involved in sex trafficking children. This provides context for the claim and its origins.", "There is no evidence to support the allegation that Clinton and Podesta were involved in sex trafficking children or that a child sex": "trafficking ring exists. This highlights the lack of substantiation for the claim.", "Various false claims and misinformation have been associated with the Pizzagate conspiracy theory": "such as the FBI confirming evidence of a \"huge underground Clinton sex network\" or Clinton being on trial for torturing and killing a 10-year-old girl on camera. This demonstrates the spread of misinformation and the lack of credibility surrounding the claim."}
