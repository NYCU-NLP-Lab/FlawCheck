However, with expanded testing, the rate has decreased.", "Timing of Operation Warp Speed": "The expert notes that by the time Operation Warp Speed was announced, most of the decline in the case-fatality rate had already occurred. This suggests that other factors, in addition to the mentioned therapies, contributed to the reduction in the fatality rate.", "Supporting evidence and data": "The White House provided a chart compiled by a Stanford University professor, which shows a decline in the case-fatality rate from mid-March to mid-July. This data supports the claim made by the White House and indicates a significant reduction in the fatality rate since April."}
