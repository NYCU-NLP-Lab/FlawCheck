{"The image of a baby holding a gun on Facebook with a subsequent post requesting someone to call 911 was found to be a meme created by pairing two unrelated images": "one taken by a father for a parenting forum and another showing symbols associated with the Insane Clown Posse.", "The funeral image": "which supposedly depicted the burial of the baby, was difficult to determine its origin. It was potentially associated with a phone-in interview on a Juggalo-themed talk radio program, but the exact connection was unclear.", "The claim was linked to the death of Anabelle Lotus Krawczyk": "a baby who died shortly after being born to \"juggalo\" parents in 2008. It was confirmed that an infant named Anabelle Lotus Krawczyk did pass away shortly after birth and is buried in Cook County, Illinois.", "The authenticity of the claim was further supported by the expertise of Bethania Palma": "a journalist from the Los Angeles area who has been working in the news industry since 2006."}
