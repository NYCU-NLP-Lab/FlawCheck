{"Analysis of Huelsman": "s research: The expert's verdict mentions that Huelsman conducted a specific analysis of students who entered college in the 2011-12 school year and took on debt from public or private lenders. He looked at whether those students graduated by 2017 and found that 38.6% of people who took out student loans in that six-year span did not complete their college education.", "Verification of graduation rates": "The expert's verdict also mentions that experts at the NCES (National Center for Education Statistics) and the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, look at graduation rates in six-year windows. This approach considers part-time students and other variables that may affect completion rates.", "Confirmation of the claim by Warren and Adams": "The expert's verdict includes statements made by Rep. Alma Adams and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who both mentioned the statistic that \"almost 40% of borrowers with student loan debt didn't finish their degree.\" This confirms that the claim is being made by credible sources.", "Consideration of alternative perspectives": "The expert's verdict includes a comment from Jill Barshay, a writer and editor for The Hechinger Report, who highlights the limitations of the six-year time frame used to measure graduation rates. Barshay points out that many people take longer than six years to complete their degree, suggesting that the statistic may not capture the full picture. This aspect adds nuance to the analysis and considers alternative viewpoints."}
