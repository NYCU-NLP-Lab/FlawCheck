{"Testimony of Mike Morell": "The expert's verdict mentions that Mike Morell, the former CIA deputy director, testified and told Congress that the reason Obama has not bombed ISIS' oil fields is because they are concerned about global warming. This testimony is presented as evidence to support the claim.", "Criticism from Ted Cruz": "Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz criticized President Obama's strategy against ISIS and brought up Mike Morell's testimony to argue that Obama prioritized a green agenda instead of defeating the jihadists. Cruz's criticism adds weight to the claim and suggests that Morell's testimony is significant.", "Lack of evidence in congressional transcripts": "The expert's verdict mentions that a search of congressional transcripts did not turn up any instance of Morell giving congressional testimony on the specific point of climate change concerns limiting attacks on ISIS' oil assets. This aspect highlights the absence of concrete evidence supporting the claim.", "Military actions against ISIS": "oil assets: The expert's verdict mentions that U.S. and coalition military forces have been targeting ISIS' oil infrastructure for over a year, with numerous airstrikes damaging or destroying oil infrastructure targets. This information contradicts the claim that the Obama administration refused to strike ISIS' oil fields due to climate change concerns, suggesting that military actions were taken regardless of such concerns."}
