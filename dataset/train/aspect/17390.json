{"The claim was made by Democrats in a mass email": "alerting their supporters about House Republicans pushing through legislation to classify pizza as a 'vegetable' for school lunches.", "The expert verified the claim by requesting evidence from the source of the email": "Brad Woodhouse at the Democratic National Committee. Woodhouse provided a CBS News/Associated Press article from November 15, 2011, titled \"Congress pushes back on healthier school lunches,\" which discussed a spending bill related to tomato paste.", "The expert analyzed the content of the article and found that the spending bill did not mention pizza specifically": "Instead, it allowed for two tablespoons of tomato paste to count as a serving of vegetables, which was a lower requirement than the proposed half-cup by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.", "The expert also cited a Washington Post Wonkblog reporter": "Sarah Kliff, who mentioned that two tablespoons of tomato paste on a pizza offered a nutritional profile comparable to a half-cup of fresh fruit, including fiber, protein, calcium, potassium, beta carotene, and lycopene."}
