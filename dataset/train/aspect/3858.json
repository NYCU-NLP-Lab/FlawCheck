{"Lack of credible source": "The expert's verdict highlights that the claim was made by a dubious website called viralactions.com. The website does not provide any information about its mission or the individuals behind it, making it difficult to determine the credibility of the claim.", "Absence of supporting evidence": "The claim states that a study conducted by Georgia State University found that 80% of black men in Atlanta are homosexuals. However, the expert's investigation did not find any evidence of such a study. This lack of supporting evidence raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Social media flags": "Facebook users flagged the post as potentially fabricated, indicating that there were concerns regarding the veracity of the claim. Social media platforms often have mechanisms in place to combat hoaxes and misinformation, and user flags can serve as an indicator of questionable content.", "Connection to fake content": "The website viralactions.com is linked to other online platforms, such as Instagram and Twitter accounts, that suggest its content is fake or satirical. The expert's investigation reveals that the Instagram page associated with viralactions.com claims to be a provider of satire articles, while the Twitter account promotes \"InfoTainment News.\" These connections to fake content sources further cast doubt on the authenticity of the claim."}
