{"The claim is based on an attack ad by the League of Conservation Voters": "which alleges that Senator Ron Johnson has taken over $100,000 from oil and gas interests and voted to allow them to emit \"unlimited carbon pollution into our air.\"", "The nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics confirms that Johnson has received": "109,550 from oil and gas interests, supporting the claim that he has received significant campaign contributions from the industry.", "The League of Conservation Voters cites three Senate votes as evidence for their claim": "Two of these votes were noted in the ad, and the third was provided as additional evidence. These votes were amendments to bills that aimed to block the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from regulating greenhouse gas emissions and repeal the agency's scientific finding that carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases are endangering human health and the environment.", "The expert also mentions that Johnson": "s vote in favor of these amendments would have prevented the EPA from regulating any carbon emissions, including those emitted in the extraction and refining of oil and by gasoline-burning vehicles. This supports the claim that Johnson voted to allow unlimited carbon pollution."}
