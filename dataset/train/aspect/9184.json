{"The lack of evidence supporting the claim that the woman in the photograph is": "Tea Cup Sallie\" and that she was a notorious prostitute. The expert found no historical records or credible sources confirming this information.", "The identification of the": "license for prostitution\" as a modern reproduction rather than a genuine artifact. The presence of a price sticker on the document suggests that it was likely available in a gift shop, indicating its novelty nature.", "The evolution of the claim surrounding the photograph": "starting from a more mundane description of a \"tea lady\" and later being attached to the false narrative of \"Tea Cup Sallie\" and her alleged prostitution license. This suggests a potential fabrication or exaggeration of the story.", "The existence of multiple versions of": "Tea Cup Sallie's license for prostitution\" supposedly issued in different cities and by different individuals over a span of more than 40 years. The fact that the woman in the photograph would have had a 44-year prostitution career during a time when life expectancy was much lower raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim."}
