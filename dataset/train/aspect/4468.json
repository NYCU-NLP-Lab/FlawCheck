{"Digital manipulation": "The expert identified that the image of the vintage Heineken advertisement was digitally manipulated and not an authentic ad. They mentioned that the image was created for a Photoshop contest hosted by the website Worth1000.", "Watermark": "The expert noted that the version of the image circulating on Twitter had been cropped to remove Worth1000's watermark. However, they were able to find an uncropped version that clearly showed the Worth1000.com logo. This helped in tracing the origin of the fake advertisement.", "Reverse image search": "The expert conducted a reverse image search to further verify the authenticity of the claim. Through this search, they were able to trace the fake advertisement back to Worth1000's 10th \"Vintage Ad\" contest in 2011, where contestants were instructed to create vintage-style ads for modern products.", "Historical context": "The expert provided historical context by mentioning a genuine advertisement from the 1950s for 7-Up soda that promoted the product as suitable for babies. They highlighted how societal beliefs and viewpoints have changed over time and that the original ad on which the Heineken spoof was based would also be met with dismay by modern audiences."}
