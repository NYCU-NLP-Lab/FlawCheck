{"Line": "item vetoes: The expert's verdict explains that the claim of \"cutting spending by $1 billion\" is technically correct, as it refers to the line-item vetoes made by Governor Chris Christie in response to a budget approved by the Democratic-controlled Legislature. These vetoes reduced the fiscal year 2012 budget to nearly $29.7 billion.", "Increase in education funding": "The claim of providing \"$850 million in new education funding\" is also supported by the expert's verdict. The fiscal year 2012 budget increases education funding by about $863 million over the prior fiscal year.", "Comparison to previous budgets": "The expert's verdict highlights that while the claim of spending cuts and increased education funding is technically accurate, it is important to consider the context. The fiscal year 2012 budget, despite the spending cuts, is still larger than the fiscal year 2011 budget signed by Governor Christie in June 2010.", "Revenue growth and projections": "The expert's verdict explains that the increase in education funding and the ability to make spending cuts were made possible by higher-than-anticipated revenue growth in fiscal year 2011 and projected revenue growth for fiscal year 2012. This aspect emphasizes the role of revenue projections and financial considerations in the claim's authenticity."}
