{"The claim that tax increases were court": "ordered or approved by the people for road-related purposes was verified to be partially true. The expert found that while some tax increases were indeed voted on and approved by the people of Arkansas, it was not specifically for roads. Instead, voters approved a bond issue that would be supported by the diesel tax and future federal highway funds.", "The expert discovered that the 3": "cent increase in the gas tax and the 4-cent increase in the diesel tax, which Huckabee attributed to being approved by the people, were actually approved by the Arkansas legislature on April 1, 1999. These tax increases were already in effect before the voters went to the polls.", "The expert concluded that while Huckabee could argue that the voters": "approval of the bond issue indirectly supported the taxes, there was no direct correlation between the taxes and the bonds. The gas tax was not directly pledged to repay the bonds.", "It was found that the need for road improvements in Arkansas": "particularly on Interstate 40 and I-30, was a significant factor in advocating for the tax increases and bond issue. The poor condition of these highways, as rated by professional truck drivers, contributed to the support from both Democrats and Republicans in the legislature."}
