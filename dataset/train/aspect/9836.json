{"Discrepancy in dropout rates": "The expert noted a significant difference between the dropout rates mentioned by the claimant and the official statistics reported by the Texas Education Agency. The claimant stated a dropout rate of 40 to 50 percent, while the agency reported a statewide high school dropout rate of 6.3 percent for the class of 2012.", "Source of data": "The claimant's campaign manager, Logan Spence, provided information on how the percentages were derived. Spence mentioned that Patrick looked at graduation rates for selected high schools in the Houston, Dallas, and Fort Worth school districts. The raw data for the class of 2012 was obtained from the TEA web pages for each school.", "Use of non": "partisan research organization: The claimant relied on the Houston-based Children at Risk Institute, a non-partisan research and advocacy organization, for the graduation rates used in the claim. The institute calculates graduation rates using state data and employs its own methodology to account for students leaving before graduation.", "Differences in methodology": "The institute's methodology for calculating graduation rates differs from that of the Texas Education Agency. The institute chooses not to believe some of the reasons schools use to account for students leaving before graduation, such as transferring to private schools or schools in other states or countries. This discrepancy in methodology can lead to variations in reported dropout rates."}
