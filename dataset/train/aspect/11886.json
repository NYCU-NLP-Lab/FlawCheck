{"The historical context of the Kente cloth": "The expert explains that the Kente cloth originated in Ghana and was worn by Ashanti royalty during the time of the slave trade. However, the modern meaning of the cloth as a symbol of black independence emerged in the 1800s as a form of opposition to British rule.", "The role of the Ashanti in the slave trade": "The expert acknowledges that the Ashanti played a documented role in the European slave trade, with millions of Africans passing through Ghana ports and being sold to British and Dutch slavers. However, it is stated that the Kente cloth was not a mark of a slave trader, but rather a symbol of Ashanti royalty.", "The transformation of the Kente cloth": "The expert explains that the brilliant colors and patterns of the modern version of the Kente cloth emerged after the British abolished slavery and enforcement of the ban in Western Africa was weak. The fabric transformed from something a person wore to a symbol of who a person was, representing indigenous leadership and self-rule.", "Lack of evidence supporting the claim": "The expert, along with a London-based researcher and African textile dealer, states that there is no evidence or historical record suggesting that the Kente cloth is a symbol of slave traders. The suggestion that it is a symbol of slave traders is not one that they have come across before."}
