{"Data from the Center for Automotive Research": "The expert referred to data from the Center for Automotive Research, a think tank in Ann Arbor, Michigan, to verify the claim. This data provided information on the number of German cars sold in the United States in 2017, which contradicted the claim of \"millions\" of cars being sent.", "Sales figures of German automakers": "The expert highlighted the sales figures of German automakers such as BMW, Daimler (Mercedes-Benz), and Volkswagen in the United States. These figures showed that the combined sales of these companies amounted to 1.35 million cars in 2017, which is significantly lower than the claimed \"millions.\"", "Production of German cars in the United States": "The expert pointed out that German automakers have manufacturing facilities in the United States, such as BMW's plant in Spartanburg, South Carolina, Mercedes' facility in Tuscaloosa County, Alabama, and Volkswagen's factory in Chattanooga, Tennessee. The production levels of German cars in the United States have increased, with some cars being sold domestically and some exported overseas.", "Import and export numbers": "The expert mentioned the import and export numbers of German cars to clarify the origin of the vehicles sold in the United States. For example, the expert cited data from Edmunds.com, which showed that approximately 330,000 of the 1.35 million German cars sold in the United States in 2017 were built domestically. This indicates that around 980,000 German cars were built elsewhere but sold in the United States."}
