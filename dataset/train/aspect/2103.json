{"The size of the hole shown in the poster": "The expert determines that the hole is too large to represent an AR-15 entrance wound and even an exit wound is unlikely to be as large as depicted.", "Comparison with photographs of actual AR": "15 marks: The expert refers to a Facebook post that includes side-by-side photographs of the poster's hole and marks left by an AR-15 rifle after target practice. The comparison shows that the poster's hole is significantly larger than the actual marks.", "Plausibility of the temporary cavity": "The expert acknowledges that the hole shown in the poster could potentially represent the diameter of the highly destructive temporary cavity left in a person's body by a high-velocity AR-15 round.", "Lack of clear origin and context": "The expert notes that the precise origins of the photograph on the left (the poster) are unclear, raising questions about its authenticity and credibility. The poster has also become the subject of ridicule and anger among some gun rights advocates online, indicating a potential bias or misinformation surrounding it."}
