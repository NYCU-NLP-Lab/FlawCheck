{"Comparison of mitochondrial DNA": "The initial verification of the claim was done in 1993 by comparing the mitochondrial DNA of wolves and dogs. This analysis showed that the domestic dog is closely related to the grey wolf, with at most 0.2% difference in mitochondrial DNA.", "Mapping of DNA sequence on chromosomes": "With advancements in technology, scientists were able to map the longer DNA sequence found on the chromosomes of wolves and dogs. This mapping revealed a 99.9% similarity (technically 99.96%) between dog and grey wolf DNA, specifically in the genes responsible for physical traits and behaviors.", "Nuclear coding": "DNA sequence analysis: Further analysis of the nuclear coding-DNA sequence showed that the domestic dog differs from the grey wolf by only ~0.04%. No dog mitochondrial DNA sequences have been found to be more closely related to other canid species.", "Hybridization and species classification": "The profound similarity between dogs and wolves has led to frequent hybridization between the two. This indicates that, by the biological definition of species, the domestic dog can be considered a subspecies of the grey wolf (canis lupus familiaris). However, there is ongoing debate about whether the domestic dog should be classified as its own distinct species (canis familiaris)."}
