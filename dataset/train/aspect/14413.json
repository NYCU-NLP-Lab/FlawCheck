{"The number of nominations confirmed by the president": "The expert verified that the claim made by Senator McConnell about the president having 1,540 nominations confirmed was accurate by checking the Library of Congress nominations database for Obama's first and second terms.", "The number of nominations defeated": "The expert questioned the claim made by Senator McConnell that only four nominations had been defeated. They pointed out that this number only referred to nominations that failed on a measure to end debate and send their names to the floor for a simple majority vote. The expert argued that this did not account for nominations that were withdrawn due to opposition from Senate Republicans.", "Methods to stymie a nomination": "The expert highlighted various tactics that can be used to stall or prevent a nomination, such as filibustering, running out the clock, or the White House withdrawing a nomination if minority opposition seems too strong. They provided examples of nominations like Susan Rice and Elizabeth Warren that were never formally nominated due to anticipated strong opposition.", "Misleading use of numbers": "The expert criticized Senator McConnell for using misleading numbers to make his claim. They argued that he was taking advantage of the fact that very few nominations actually fail through a direct vote, while ignoring the impact of other tactics employed to block nominations."}
