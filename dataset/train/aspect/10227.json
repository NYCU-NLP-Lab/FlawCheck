{"The use of statistical data": "The expert's verdict mentions that Hillary Clinton presented a statistic stating that African-American children are 500 percent more likely to die from asthma than white kids. The expert then verifies this claim by referring to a 2006 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study that confirms Clinton's claim almost verbatim.", "Comparison with other racial groups": "The expert's verdict compares the rates of asthma-related emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and deaths between black and white children. The data shows that black children have significantly higher rates in all these categories, supporting the claim made by Clinton.", "Longitudinal analysis": "The expert's verdict mentions that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study analyzed childhood asthma data from 1980 to 2005, indicating a long-term trend of racial disparities in asthma-related outcomes. This longitudinal analysis adds credibility to the claim.", "Additional recent data": "The expert's verdict cites a study from 2014 that examines rates of childhood asthma in black and white children, using data from 2010. This more recent data further confirms Clinton's claim and suggests that the problem may be even more severe than initially stated."}
