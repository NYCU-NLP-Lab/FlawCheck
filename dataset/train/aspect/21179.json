{"The expert consulted the 2010 Annual Report to Congress on White House Staff": "which provided online data on the number of staff members associated with the first lady's office. This report helped verify the claim by identifying 15 staffers with the words \"first lady\" in their title and three more under the category of \"social.\"", "The expert also sought the opinion of Myra Gutin": "an expert on first ladies and politics at Rider University in New Jersey. Gutin confirmed that as of 2009, Michelle Obama had 22 people on her staff. Although she didn't have more recent data, Gutin expressed doubt that the number had nearly doubled to the 43 claimed by Glenn Beck.", "Catherine McCormick": "Lelyveld, a spokeswoman for Michelle Obama, provided information that the first lady's staff is now closer to 25 people. McCormick-Lelyveld emphasized that this number is consistent with the size of Laura Bush's staff and is based on a similar staffing model. She refuted the suggestion that Michelle Obama's staff is larger than her predecessor's.", "The expert also referred to previous fact": "checking efforts by FactCheck.org and Snopes.com in 2009, which debunked the claim that Michelle Obama had an \"unprecedented\" number of staffers with 22. This historical context further supported the conclusion that the claim of 43 staff members was inaccurate."}
