{"Indisputable photographic evidence": "The expert's verdict mentions that pro-Trump attorney Lin Wood tweeted two images as evidence that Antifa violently broke into Congress. The presence of these images is considered as photographic evidence to support the claim.", "Social media posts": "The claim appeared on various social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. The expert's verdict highlights the presence of these posts as a means to verify the claim.", "FBI statement": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation's Washington Field Office explicitly stated that they had \"no credible intelligence\" suggesting Antifa's involvement in the criminal activity at the US Capitol. This statement from a credible law enforcement agency helps verify the claim.", "Debunking of false evidence": "The expert's verdict also mentions the debunking of false evidence related to the claim. It specifically highlights the correction made by The Washington Times regarding the identification of Antifa members using facial recognition software. This correction discredits the evidence that was initially presented to support the claim."}
