{"The claim was verified by examining the actual text of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act": "specifically Chapter 49, SEC. 5000B, which clearly states that a 10 percent tax is imposed on indoor tanning services.", "The expert also considered the statement made by President Obama during the White House Correspondents Association Dinner": "where he jokingly mentioned Snooki and other Jersey Shore cast members being exempt from the indoor tanning tax. This provided additional evidence that the claim was accurate.", "The expert analyzed the context in which Snooki made the claim": "which was in a video promo for MTV's Jersey Shore. This helped establish the credibility of the claim as Snooki was speaking about her personal experience with the tax.", "The expert also investigated the origin of the indoor tanning tax": "revealing that it was proposed by Senate Democrats as an alternative to a tax on cosmetic surgery. This information helped shed light on the political motivations behind the tax and its connection to President Obama."}
