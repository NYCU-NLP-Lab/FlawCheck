{"Lack of credible sources": "The expert notes that the initial claim was based on anecdotal information from an anonymous \"insider\" and not on medical reports or first-hand knowledge from the singer's family. This lack of credible sources raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Refutation by family members": "Ozzy Osbourne's daughter, Kelly Osbourne, directly refuted the claim about her father being on his deathbed. She stated that the media reports were false and expressed frustration with the sensationalized headlines. This refutation by a family member adds weight to the skepticism surrounding the claim.", "Contradictory evidence": "The expert highlights that while Ozzy Osbourne did face some health issues in 2019, including a fall, surgery, and pneumonia, there is no evidence to support the claim that he was on his deathbed. The contradictory evidence of him spending time with his daughter and refuting the claim further undermines its authenticity.", "Band": "s denial: Black Sabbath, the band Ozzy Osbourne is associated with, also refuted the claim on their Facebook page, describing the article as \"so very fake.\" The band's denial adds another layer of doubt to the claim and strengthens the argument against its authenticity."}
