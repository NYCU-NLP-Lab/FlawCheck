{"The origin of the claim": "The expert mentions that the claim originated from a Facebook post on October 5, 2016, which was later picked up by outlets like Hello Giggles and Lifehacker. This aspect verifies the source of the claim and its circulation in online platforms.", "The explanation of the claim": "The expert provides a detailed explanation of how the claim works, stating that if the ice melts completely, the coin will fall to the bottom of the cup before refreezing. This aspect verifies the mechanism behind the claim.", "Assumption 1": "The expert highlights the first assumption made by the claim, which is that the coin will change position even if the ice melts partially. The expert explains that due to the density difference between ice and water, the ice on which the coin rests may float on the water, potentially leading to an inaccurate assessment of power loss. This aspect questions the validity of the claim's assumption.", "Assumption 2": "The expert mentions the second assumption made by the claim, which is that if the ice doesn't melt completely, the food will be fine. The expert points out that the time it takes for ice to melt in an unpowered freezer depends on various factors, making it uncertain whether the coin test accurately represents a significant loss of power. This aspect challenges the claim's assumption regarding food safety."}
