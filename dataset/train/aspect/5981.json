{"Lack of recorded deaths attributed to topical application of Vicks VapoRub": "The expert found no documented cases of deaths in or outside the United States caused by the use of Vicks VapoRub on the skin.", "Inconsistent information in the claim": "The expert noted that the claim mentioned a Mexican mother's tragedy, but there were no news articles or reports from November 2016 or any other time period indicating the death of a child due to topical use of Vicks VapoRub.", "Death caused by ingestion": "not topical application: The expert cited a 2001 study that reported the death of a child who ingested camphorated oil, not a topical solution of Vicks. This indicates that the claim's assertion of a child being poisoned by topical application is inaccurate.", "Research on respiratory inflammation conducted on ferrets": "not human babies: The expert mentioned a study conducted on ferrets in 2009, which demonstrated respiratory inflammation caused by menthol-containing rubs. However, this study did not involve human babies, suggesting that the claim's reference to respiratory inflammation in infants may not be applicable."}
