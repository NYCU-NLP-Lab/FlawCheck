{"Testimony of Matt Damon": "The claim is supported by the statement made by actor Matt Damon, who has been actively involved in providing clean water to the poor through his organization Water.org. Damon stated that the poor often pay more for water than the middle class and in some cases, up to 25 percent of their income.", "Anecdotal Evidence from Water": "org Co-founder: Rosemary Gudelj, spokeswoman for Water.org, confirmed that the claim was based on anecdotal evidence from the organization's co-founder Gary White. White's experience in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, during his research for his master's thesis, led him to meet people who paid up to 25 percent of their income for water.", "United Nations Development Program Estimate": "A 2006 estimate from the United Nations Development Program supported Damon's point by stating that in Uganda, water payments represented as much as 22 percent of the average income of urban households in the poorest 20 percent of the income distribution. The report also highlighted similar situations in countries like Argentina, El Salvador, and Jamaica, where the bottom fifth of households spent over 10 percent of their income on water.", "Disparity in Water Prices": "The report mentioned that the core problem lies in the fact that the poorest families often pay the highest prices for water due to their lack of access to piped water services available to middle class and wealthy households. It highlighted examples from cities like Jakarta, Lima, Manila, and Nairobi, where households in slums and low-income settlements typically paid 5-10 times more for water compared to high-income residents in the same city. In Manila, an estimated 4 million people received water resold through kiosks and pushcarts, further emphasizing the higher costs borne by the poor."}
