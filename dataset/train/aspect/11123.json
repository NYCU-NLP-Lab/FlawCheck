{"The claim was based on a false article published by the conservative": "news-aggregation\" website Observatorial.", "There is no record of President Obama making the quoted remarks about deserving a monument to himself": "3. The article falsely claimed that unnamed activists were already planning for Obama to be potentially added to Mt. Rushmore, which has been debunked as fake news.", "The claim referenced two genuine stories": "but they were not directly linked or accurately represented in the article. One story mentioned a survey of professors at George Washington University who speculated about the possibility of honoring Obama on a monument in the future, while the other mentioned a Facebook page and a Huffington Post op-ed discussing the idea of putting Obama on Mount Rushmore, but it was clarified that there is no room for additional additions to the monument."}
