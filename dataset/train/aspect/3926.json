{"The claim emphasizes that the building in question is not a mosque but rather a cultural center with a prayer area": "This aspect is supported by statements from Bloomberg's Al Hunt and Frank Rich, who both assert that it is not a mosque but an Islamic cultural center containing a prayer room.", "The website for the project": "Park51.org, describes the plan as a Muslim YMCA-type operation and details various facilities and amenities, such as a swimming pool, gym, basketball court, auditorium, restaurant, culinary school, exhibitions, education programs, library, art studios, childcare services, and a September 11 memorial. This aspect suggests that the building serves a broader purpose beyond just being a mosque.", "The plan includes a separate non": "profit organization that will run the mosque, indicating that it will be distinct from the overall Park51 project. The website explains that the mosque will be located within the planned final structure of Park51 but will operate independently.", "The project": "s owner and developer, Sharif El-Gamal, was asked about the necessity of including a mosque in the project. In his response, he mentioned the community-centric interfaith mission of the project and the importance of having a general prayer area that could be reserved in advance by any religious group. This aspect suggests that the inclusion of a mosque was a deliberate choice based on the project's mission and goals."}
