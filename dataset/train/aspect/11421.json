{"The source of the claim": "The expert investigated the source of the claim and found that it originated from a Democratic debate where Bill Richardson made the statement. The expert also mentioned that Richardson's deputy communications director pointed to a BBC-sponsored poll of Iraqis as the source of the statistic.", "The wording of the poll question": "The expert analyzed the wording of the poll question and found that it did not directly support the claim made by Richardson. The question asked about the acceptability of \"attacks on coalition forces,\" which is different from \"shooting an American soldier.\" The expert highlighted the disparity in the wording and how it could have influenced the responses.", "Exclusion of Kurdish responses": "The expert noted that Richardson may have excluded the responses of Kurds in order to support his 65 percent figure. By removing the Kurdish responses, the math aligns with Richardson's statement. However, the expert pointed out that this exaggerates the poll results and does not accurately reflect the claim made by Richardson, which referred to \"the Iraqi people\" as a whole.", "Interpretation of the poll results": "The expert mentioned the opinion of polling expert John G. Geer, who theorized that the question about \"attacks on coalition forces\" does not equate to \"shooting an American soldier.\" Geer suggested that the responses might have been different if the question had been more specific. The expert highlighted Geer's viewpoint to emphasize that the poll results may not fully support the claim made by Richardson."}
