{"Previous instances of similar scams": "The expert mentions that this claim is the latest iteration of a common scam that frequently appears on social media. They provide examples of previous scam coupon offers that circulated with the ALDI logo in December 2015, May 2016, and 2018. This previous history of similar scams raises doubts about the authenticity of the current claim.", "Lack of verification from ALDI": "ALDI themselves have noted on their Facebook page that these coupons are not legitimate. The expert highlights that the coupon offers are a form of survey scam and that the survey pages and Facebook page associated with the claim have no affiliation with the company. The fact that ALDI has publicly stated that the coupons are a scam adds to the credibility of the expert's verdict.", "Request for personal information": "The expert points out that in order to obtain the \"free\" gift cards, users are asked to take a brief survey that requires providing personal information such as home address, telephone number, email address, and date of birth. This is a common tactic used by scammers to collect personal data for malicious purposes. The request for personal information raises concerns about the authenticity of the claim.", "Deceptive website warning": "The expert mentions that attempting to visit the linked domain (ALDI-COM.com) led to a \"deceptive site ahead\" warning, indicating that the website is potentially dangerous or fraudulent. This warning further supports the expert's verdict that the claim is not authentic."}
