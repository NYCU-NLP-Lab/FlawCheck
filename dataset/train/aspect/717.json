They compared the average premium in 2008 with the average premium in 2014 to verify this aspect of the claim.", "Use of a reputable source": "The expert noted that the claim was supported by a September 2014 report from the Kaiser Family Foundation, a respected source on health care. They examined the findings of this report to validate the claim.", "Evaluation of the starting point": "The expert pointed out that the claim used the average premium in 2008 as a starting point, which was during the presidency of George W. Bush. They deemed this to be a bad starting point and instead looked at the average premium in 2009 when Obama took office to determine the accurate increase in premiums.", "Contextual analysis": "The expert provided additional context by comparing the percentage increase in average family premiums during Obama's presidency (2009-2014) with the previous five-year period (2004-2009). This analysis revealed that the increase during Obama's tenure was lower than the previous period, indicating that premium growth was not inordinately high."}
