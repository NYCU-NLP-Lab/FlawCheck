{"The claim was based on a study conducted by the National Economics Research Association": "NERA), which predicted that the Paris climate deal could lead to the loss of 2.7 million jobs in the U.S. by 2025 if the country adhered to the commitments made by the Obama Administration.", "The study": "s results were presented in a misleading way, as it used an extreme model to estimate the job losses and selectively used results from a single implementation scenario and a single year. The purpose of NERA's analysis was to explore the challenges of achieving reductions from U.S. industrial sectors over a longer term, not to provide estimates of the impact of the Paris Agreement alone.", "The study was funded by the American Council for Capital Formation and the U": "S. Chamber of Commerce, both of which were vocal opponents of the Paris climate agreement. This raises concerns about potential biases in the research and its findings.", "Experts": "such as law professor Cary Coglianese and economics professor Gary Yohe, have criticized the study's model and its accuracy in reflecting the reality of the economy. Coglianese stated that the model used in the NERA analysis does not align with the general understanding of the economy, casting doubt on the accuracy of the job loss forecast."}
