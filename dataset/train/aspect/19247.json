{"The expert": "s verdict provides information about the ongoing debate in state legislature regarding the prohibition of mountaintop coal mining in Tennessee. This context helps verify the claim made by Lt. Gov. Ron Ramsey about the proposed ban on coal mining above 2,000 feet.", "The expert mentions that the 2": "000-foot level is based on the U.S. Forest Service's classification of \"ecological subregions.\" This scientific basis for drawing a line between coal-bearing areas provides evidence to support the claim made by Dawn Coppick, an attorney and legislative director of the Lindquist Appalachian Environmental Fellowship (LEAF), who helped draft the bill.", "The expert also states that supporters": "opponents, and the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation all agree that there is coal in Tennessee below the 2,000-foot elevation level. This consensus among different stakeholders further verifies that the claim made by Lt. Gov. Ron Ramsey is inaccurate.", "The presence of maps": "both from the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation and LEAF, showing coal reserves below the 2,000-foot elevation level also serves as evidence to counter the claim made by Lt. Gov. Ron Ramsey. These maps provide visual confirmation that the proposed ban would not effectively block all coal mining in Tennessee."}
