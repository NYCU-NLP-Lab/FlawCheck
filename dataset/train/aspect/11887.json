{"Lack of complaints": "The expert's verdict mentions that top election officials in the New Hampshire Secretary of State\u2019s Office, New Hampshire Attorney General\u2019s Office, and U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in New Hampshire have received no complaints of voter fraud in the most recent election. This suggests that there is no evidence or indication of serious voter fraud in New Hampshire.", "Limited cases of fraud": "The expert's verdict states that the New Hampshire Attorney General\u2019s office has prosecuted only two criminal fraud cases, one civil fraud case, and investigated other complaints since 2012. This indicates that instances of voter fraud in New Hampshire have been scant and not on a widespread scale.", "Verification process": "The expert's verdict mentions that New Hampshire has a verification process in place where voters are required to show a valid ID at the polls. If they don't have one, their picture is taken, and they have to sign an affidavit. After the election, confirmation letters are sent to check their identities. This process helps ensure the authenticity of the votes cast.", "Lack of evidence supporting the claim": "The expert's verdict highlights that despite claims made by Trump's spokesman and a national study about invalid or inaccurate voter registrations, no evidence of \"serious voter fraud\" in New Hampshire has been provided. This suggests that there is no substantial evidence to support the claim of voter fraud in the state."}
