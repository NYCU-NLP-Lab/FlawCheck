{"Historical evidence": "The expert refers to the documented historical event of the Space Shuttle Challenger explosion on January 28, 1986, which resulted in the death of all seven astronauts on board. This historical evidence establishes the authenticity of the claim.", "Eyewitness accounts": "The expert mentions that the Challenger crew members were witnessed by numerous individuals at the time of the explosion. These eyewitness accounts further support the authenticity of the claim that the astronauts did not survive the accident.", "Lack of disguise or name change": "The expert highlights the implausibility of NASA faking the deaths of the astronauts and allowing them to openly live out their lives without disguising their physical appearances or changing their names. This lack of effort to conceal their identities undermines the credibility of the claim.", "Statistical improbability": "The expert emphasizes the statistical improbability of six out of seven Challenger crew members having doppelg\u00e4ngers with the same names and similar or identical appearances. The chances of such a coincidence occurring are highly unlikely, further discrediting the claim."}
