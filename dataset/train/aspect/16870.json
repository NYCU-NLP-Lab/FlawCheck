{"The expert analyzed data from the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity": "which showed that 2,048 jobs had been created in rural counties as a result of Enterprise Florida incentive projects since Governor Rick Scott took office.", "The expert found that most of the incentives money awarded by Enterprise Florida went to existing Florida businesses with over 1": "000 employees, suggesting that the job gains cited by Scott's administration may not be directly attributed to the agency's involvement.", "The expert highlighted that even though some jobs did materialize in rural counties": "it is difficult to prove that they were created solely as a result of Enterprise Florida's involvement. The expert noted that Florida's rural counties have experienced exceptional job growth, and if a significant portion of this growth occurred without state intervention, it suggests that the rural growth rate would have been exceptional even without the agency's projects.", "The expert mentioned that Kurt Wenner": "the vice president of research at business-backed Florida TaxWatch, believes that the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity and Enterprise Florida do contribute to economic development in rural areas. Wenner stated that even small economic development projects can have a significant impact in small counties."}
