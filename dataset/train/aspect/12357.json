{"Lack of concrete evidence": "The expert notes that the television news report provided no concrete evidence to support the claim of a secret underground tunnel. The broadcast did not include any statements from members of Tablighi Jamaat, officials of the Nizamuddin Markaz, or the police. This lack of evidence raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Reliance on hyperbole": "The expert highlights that the television news report used hyperbole to sow seeds of doubt without providing any evidence. The report claimed that Maulana Saad had transformed from a \"corona master\" to a \"criminal master,\" but it did not provide any specific details about the alleged criminal activities carried out through the tunnel. This reliance on hyperbole without substantiating evidence undermines the credibility of the claim.", "Use of representational video footage": "The expert points out that the footage aired by the channel was labeled as \"representational video.\" This suggests that the images of the tunnel were not actual footage but rather animations or graphics. Without real video evidence, the authenticity of the claim becomes questionable.", "Source of the tunnel image": "The expert reveals that a reverse-image search of one of the graphics used to represent the tunnel leads to a video game called \"Hills Legend: Act.\" This indicates that the image used by the channel was not related to any real underground tunnel but was instead taken from a fictional source. This discovery further undermines the credibility of the claim."}
