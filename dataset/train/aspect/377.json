{"Reduction of shared revenue to municipalities": "The expert notes that Governor Scott Walker cut shared revenue to local governments by $76 million, or 9 percent, in his first state budget. This reduction strained the budgets of local governments in terms of providing police and fire services.", "Limits on property tax increases": "The expert mentions that Governor Walker also implemented strict limits on how much local governments could raise property taxes. This measure could have further impacted the funding available for law enforcement agencies.", "Act 10 collective bargaining reform": "The expert highlights that Walker's Act 10 law, which reformed collective bargaining for public employees, helped many local governments absorb some of the shared revenue cuts. By requiring public employees to contribute more towards their health and pension benefits, Act 10 aimed to alleviate the financial burden on local governments.", "Lack of evidence linking cuts to law enforcement agencies": "The expert points out that while it is true that Walker cut shared revenue to local governments, there is no evidence provided by Mary Burke to suggest that these cuts led to significant reductions in law enforcement agencies. The expert specifically mentions that the size of Milwaukee's police force remained steady during Walker's tenure as governor."}
