{"Shifting descriptions": "The expert noted that the claim of a 28-foot alligator in Florida had evolved over time. Initially, the claim was about a 13-foot alligator in Texas, but it gradually grew in size to 23 feet and eventually reached 28 feet in length. This inconsistency raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Multiple locations": "The claim mentions different locations where the alleged alligator was found, including Bay City, Texas, and various places in Florida like Lakeland, Winter Haven, Orlando, and Titusville. The expert's observation of these varying locations adds to the uncertainty surrounding the claim's authenticity.", "Eyewitness accounts": "The expert highlighted the accounts of neighbors who claimed to have seen a massive alligator in the waterway behind the house of Anita and Charlie Rogers. Initially, the Rogers dismissed these stories as exaggerations, but after the alligator was killed, they realized the tales were understated. The inclusion of eyewitness testimonies adds some credibility to the claim.", "Photographs and descriptions": "The expert mentioned the presence of photographs depicting a large alligator, along with accompanying descriptions. These photographs were circulated via email and showed the purported alligator killed in Texas and later in various locations in Florida. While the authenticity of the photographs cannot be determined solely based on the expert's verdict, their existence is an aspect employed to verify the claim."}
