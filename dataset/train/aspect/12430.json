{"Economic feasibility": "The expert would have examined the claim to determine if it is economically feasible for an iron ore mine in northern Wisconsin to operate for 100 years and generate billions of dollars in economic activity. This would involve analyzing factors such as the current market demand for iron ore, the estimated reserves in the area, and the potential profitability of the mine.", "Environmental impact": "The expert would have assessed the potential environmental impact of the proposed iron ore mine. This would involve considering factors such as the destruction of natural habitats, pollution of water sources, and the release of greenhouse gases. The expert would have evaluated whether the claim takes into account the environmental consequences of such a large-scale mining operation.", "Technical feasibility": "The expert would have examined the technical aspects of the claim, such as the mining methods proposed by Gogebic Taconite and the availability of resources and infrastructure required for the operation of the mine. This would involve assessing whether the claim takes into account the practical challenges and limitations associated with mining iron ore in a remote location.", "Long": "term sustainability: The expert would have evaluated the claim's assertion that the mine would operate for 100 years. This would involve considering factors such as the lifespan of the iron ore deposits, the potential for depletion or diminishing quality of the ore over time, and the ability of the mining company to sustain operations for such a long duration. The expert would have assessed whether the claim's projection of long-term sustainability is supported by evidence and realistic forecasts."}
