{"Reports from readers dating back to 1980": "The expert mentions that some readers have reported hearing the claim about \"Grade D but edible\" meat being used in Taco Bell, prisons, and school cafeterias as far back as 1980. This historical evidence suggests that the claim has been circulating for a significant period of time.", "Anecdotal stories and personal accounts": "The expert refers to various anecdotal stories and personal accounts that support the claim. These stories involve individuals claiming to have seen crates of meat labeled as \"Grade D but edible\" being delivered to kitchens or being present in the kitchens themselves. While no photographic evidence is provided, these personal accounts contribute to the authenticity of the claim.", "Mention of other establishments": "The expert mentions that aside from Taco Bell, the claim has also been associated with college cafeterias, grade school lunchrooms, children's summer camps, and prisons. The fact that the claim is not limited to one specific establishment but extends to various types of food service providers adds credibility to the claim.", "Clarification on meat grading system": "The expert explains that the meat grading system in the U.S. does not use letter grades like \"Grade D.\" Instead, meat is inspected by the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) to ensure safety, wholesomeness, and accurate labeling. This clarification suggests that the use of \"Grade D but edible\" meat is unlikely and reinforces the authenticity of the claim."}
