{"The claim is supported by a report from the McKinsey Global Institute titled": "A Tool Kit to Close California's Housing Gap: 3.5 Million Homes by 2025\". This report provides data and analysis on California's housing supply and ranks California 49th out of 50 states in per capita housing units.", "The report states that California is short about two million housing units compared to other states when benchmarked on a per capita basis": "This indicates a significant housing shortage in the state.", "The expert": "Carol Galante, a professor of affordable housing and urban policy at UC Berkeley, agrees with the low ranking of California in terms of housing units per capita. She attributes this to the state's complex regulatory system, including the land-use discretion of local governments and high fees imposed on developers.", "The expert also mentions that California": "s pace of home building has significantly lagged behind other states, indicating a slower rate of housing production over time. This suggests that while the state may have a relatively low per capita housing supply, it does not necessarily mean it has the lowest per capita production."}
