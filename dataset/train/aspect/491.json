{"Cuomo": "s statement about New York being ranked 46th in terms of percentage of deaths in nursing homes was fact-checked using data analysis from The New York Times. The expert reached out to Cuomo's press office and found that the claim was based on previous iterations of the Times' data, which showed New York as the 45th state.", "The expert also consulted KFF": "formerly the Kaiser Family Foundation), a nonpartisan source of health information, to verify Cuomo's claim. According to KFF's policy analyst, Priya Chidambaram, one key difference between New York and other states is that New York excludes deaths that were not in a nursing home. This means that nursing home residents who develop serious illness and need to be treated in a hospital, but do not recover, are not counted as part of the state's nursing home deaths. The expert noted that state data is not comparable due to the different ways states report these deaths, with some including various long-term care facilities in their data while others only report nursing homes.", "The expert highlighted the controversy surrounding Cuomo": "s administration's handling of the coronavirus in nursing homes. Cuomo faced criticism for a March 25 order, which was rescinded in May, that required nursing homes to accept coronavirus patients from hospitals. This order put pressure on nursing homes and has been linked to the spread of the virus among vulnerable residents.", "The expert mentioned the scrutiny over how New York has counted COVID": "19 deaths in nursing homes. The way deaths are counted can impact rankings and comparisons between states. The expert emphasized the need for consistent and comparable data to accurately analyze nursing home deaths."}
