{"Senate roll call vote": "The expert mentions that the Senate roll call vote on the New START treaty was 71-26 in favor of ratification, with three senators not voting. This indicates that a significant majority of senators supported the treaty, suggesting that there may not have been widespread opposition within the State and Defense Departments.", "Support from former Secretaries of State": "The expert mentions that former Secretaries of State, including Henry Kissinger, George Shultz, James Baker, Lawrence Eagleburger, and Colin Powell, endorsed the treaty in a 2010 editorial. This suggests that experienced diplomats who have previously served in the State Department supported the treaty, further undermining the claim of significant concerns within the department.", "Current Secretary of State": "s endorsement: The expert mentions that Hillary Clinton, the current Secretary of State at the time, backed the treaty in repeated public statements and praised its ratification. This indicates that the highest-ranking official in the State Department supported the treaty, contradicting the claim of significant concerns within the department.", "Lack of specific opposition sources": "The expert mentions that when asked about the concerns, Del. Bill Janis, the Republican criticizing the treaty, referred to news reports without providing specific sources or individuals who expressed significant concerns. This lack of specific opposition sources weakens the claim and suggests that the concerns may not have been as significant as portrayed."}
