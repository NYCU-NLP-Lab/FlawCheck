{"The claim made by David Brat during the debate was that": "our kids are scoring at the bottom of science and mathematics right now in the industrialized world -- at the bottom.\"", "Brat": "s campaign provided a column by Stanford University mathematician Keith Devlin that examined the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) tests given to 15-year-olds every three years since 2000.", "Devlin": "s column stated that in 2006, American students ranked last in math and 21st out of 30 in science among the industrialized nations. It also highlighted that only 1 percent of American 15-year-olds could perform at the highest level, and 28 percent had essentially no math skills.", "However": "a fact-check revealed that the United States' rankings on international tests were not consistently at the bottom. The National Center for Educational Statistics reported rankings that varied over the years, with the US being 14th, 17th, and 20th in science among OECD countries in 2000, 2009, and 2012 respectively. Similarly, in math, the rankings were 18th, and 27th among OECD countries in 2000 and 2012 respectively."}
