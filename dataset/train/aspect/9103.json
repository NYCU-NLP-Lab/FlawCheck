{"The bill in question": "A416, was first introduced in 2015 during the Ebola outbreak and has not gained any traction in the New York State Assembly. This verifies that the claim is based on outdated information and the bill is not currently being considered.", "The bill specifically applies to infected people and their contacts who refuse to quarantine in a health emergency": "This verifies that the bill does not target non-mask wearers or people who don't want to take the vaccine, as claimed in the post.", "The bill allows officials to detain contagious patients during a health emergency": "but it does not mention concentration camps or forced vaccination. This verifies that the claim exaggerates the provisions of the bill and spreads conspiracy theories.", "The bill requires a court order if the detentions last longer than three business days": "This verifies that the bill includes safeguards and oversight to prevent abuse of power and protect individuals' rights."}
