{"The claim is based on a theory proposed by a law professor": "Brian Kalt, who argued that there is a \"loophole\" in the judicial boundaries of Yellowstone National Park that would make it difficult or impossible to prosecute crimes requiring a jury trial.", "No crime committed within the disputed boundaries of Yellowstone National Park has been brought to court": "making it uncertain how a court proceeding would unfold in this area. Therefore, there is no legal precedent for criminal prosecutions in this specific region.", "While there is a rumored legal loophole that could potentially allow someone to": "get away with murder\" in a 50-square-mile stretch of Yellowstone National Park known as the \"Zone of Death,\" it is crucial to note that this claim is overly generalized and largely inaccurate, according to law professor Brian Kalt.", "The potential loophole is related to the Vicinage Clause of the Sixth Amendment": "which states that a person charged with a crime has the right to be tried before an impartial jury from the state and judicial district where the crime was committed. However, the extent and applicability of this loophole are still subject to legal interpretation and limitations."}
