{"The statement made by President": "elect Donald Trump regarding Georgia's 5th congressional district being \"in horrible shape and falling apart (not to mention crime infested)\" was in response to Democratic Georgia Rep. John Lewis's statement questioning Trump's legitimacy as president.", "The district": "s representative, John Lewis, has a long record of action and leadership in the civil rights movement, including numerous arrests for protesting segregation and advocating for racial justice in the 1960s.", "The transition team spokesperson referred to the district": "s unemployment, poverty, and crime rates to support the claim. While these rates are higher than national and state averages, calling the district \"crime infested\" is an exaggeration.", "Data from the Census Bureau": "s My Congressional District service and the Brookings Institution's Metro Monitor report indicate that the district, particularly Atlanta, is experiencing growth in areas such as job and wage growth, education, and business development. Therefore, the claim that the district is \"falling apart\" is not supported by these metrics."}
