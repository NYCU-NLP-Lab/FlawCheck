{"The presence of a copyright notice on the photograph": "indicating that it was copyrighted in 1937 to Coles Studio, provides evidence of its authenticity and origin.", "The fact that other variations of the image were attached to various locales": "such as North Dakota, suggests that the image may have originally circulated as a postcard, which was a common practice in the early 20th century.", "The expert": "s observation that if the image were real, the grasshopper would cast a shadow on the man's pants and on the ground in the same direction as the man's shadow, highlights a discrepancy that raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "The historical context and information about photographer Frank D": "Pop\" Conard, who was known for creating exaggerated postcards featuring giant grasshoppers, suggests that the photograph in question may be part of this tradition and not a genuine depiction of a man holding a 3-foot grasshopper."}
