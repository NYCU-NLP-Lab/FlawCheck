{"Verification of wage claims": "The expert examined data on wages and concluded that while wages have been flat since the 1970s, Sanders characterized them as low, which is a subjective judgment. The expert did not dispute this characterization.", "Examination of working hours": "The expert analyzed various sources of data on working hours and found mixed evidence. While the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed a decline in average weekly hours for production and nonsupervisory employees in the private sector since the 1960s, Gallup surveys indicated that workers reported working longer hours. However, historical data from Gallup surveys did not show a significant change in the number of hours reported by full-time employees between 2001 and 2014.", "Assessment of income distribution": "The expert acknowledged that there is ample data indicating a concentration of new income among the wealthiest Americans, which aligns with Sanders' overall theme. However, the degree of concentration was not specified, and the expert noted that Sanders' claim of \"almost all\" new income going to the top 1 percent was different from his previous statement of 99 percent.", "Evaluation of previous claims": "The expert mentioned that PolitiFact had previously examined variations of Sanders' claims on wages, hours, and income distribution. This suggests that the authenticity of the claim was assessed based on past fact-checking efforts and the consistency of Sanders' statements over time."}
