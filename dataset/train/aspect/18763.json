{"Length of the bill": "The expert verified the claim by checking the page count of the bill. They found that the bill passed by the Senate in December 2009 had a page count of 2,409, and when combined with the reconciliation bill passed by both chambers, the total page count was 2,464. Although the claim of a 2,733-page bill was slightly off, the expert acknowledged that there were different versions and page formatting variations that could account for the discrepancy.", "Amendments to the bill": "The expert investigated whether there were no amendments made to the bill during its passage. They found that the claim was not accurate, as there were amendments made to the bill during its journey through the Senate and House. The expert referred to a transcript of the press conference where the full quote from Rep. Joe Pitts stated that the bill passed without amendments in the Senate and House. However, the expert confirmed that amendments were indeed made during the legislative process.", "Bypassing Senate committee": "The expert addressed the claim that the bill bypassed Senate committees. They found that the bill did not bypass Senate committees, as it went through the regular committee process before being considered on the Senate floor. The expert referred to the transcript of the press conference where Rep. Joe Pitts mentioned that the bill went directly from Harry Reid's desk to the Senate floor, but the expert confirmed that this statement was not accurate.", "Partisan vote": "The expert examined the claim that the bill passed on a partisan vote. They found that the claim was accurate, as the bill did pass on a partisan vote without significant support from the opposing party. The expert referred to the transcript of the press conference where Rep. Joe Pitts mentioned that the bill passed on a partisan vote, and this was confirmed to be true."}
