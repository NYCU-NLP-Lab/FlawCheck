{"The claim is based on a study conducted by the Texas Transportation Institute at Texas A": "M University in 2011. This study is often cited as a gauge of traffic congestion in the U.S.", "The study found that drivers in the Washington area": "which includes parts of northern Virginia and Maryland, spent an average of 74 hours in traffic jams during 2010, the most in the country. This data supports the claim that Northern Virginia is heavily trafficked.", "The Washington region has consistently ranked first or second in the yearly delay per commuter in each annual report by the Texas Transportation Institute since 1999": "This further supports the claim that Northern Virginia is heavily congested.", "The claim was also supported by Governor Bob McDonnell": "who specifically mentioned Northern Virginia as the most heavily trafficked place in the country during a news conference. While his language was a bit inexact, he clarified in a prepared speech that the Washington, D.C./Northern Virginia metropolitan area was ranked as the most congested area in terms of commuter delay in the U.S. by the Texas Transportation Institute."}
