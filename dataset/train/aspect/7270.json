{"Historical background": "The expert mentions that chlorpyrifos has been the subject of regulatory battles for decades, indicating that the claim's assertion about the insecticide's origins in Nazi Germany is incorrect.", "Regulatory actions": "The expert describes the regulatory actions taken regarding chlorpyrifos, including the 2000 ban on nearly all residential and indoor uses and the EPA's ruling that it would remain classified as safe for use in other agricultural and industrial settings. This suggests that the claim's assertion about the EPA banning the chemical is inaccurate.", "Court order and EPA response": "The expert mentions the court order in September 2015, which mandated that the EPA either ban chlorpyrifos completely or issue final rulings on tolerances of its residue on food products. The EPA's proposal in November 2015 suggested revoking all currently published tolerances, indicating that the claim's assertion about the EPA reversing its decision after a donation from Dow Chemicals is unfounded.", "CEO": "s involvement: The expert mentions the scrutiny faced by the decision to deny the petition, highlighting the CEO of Dow Chemical, Andrew Liveris. This suggests that the claim's assertion about Dow Chemicals donating to President Trump's inauguration fund and influencing the decision is questionable."}
