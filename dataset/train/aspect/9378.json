{"Lack of citation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim of \"Ten percent of violent deaths in the U.S. each year are due to strangulation\" was made without any citation or reference to the source of this statistic. This lack of citation raises concerns about the authenticity of the claim.", "Previous use of the statistic": "The expert's investigation reveals that the authors, Dr. George E. McClane and Gael B. Strack, have been using this statistic for a while. However, in their previous articles and writings, they also fail to provide a clear source or data for this claim. This lack of transparency about the origin of the statistic raises doubts about its accuracy.", "Inconsistent citation of previous work": "The expert's investigation highlights that McClane's previous research, which supposedly contains the data supporting the claim, is not cited in the 2001 article by McClane and Strack. This inconsistency in citing previous work is unusual for researchers and adds to the uncertainty surrounding the claim's authenticity.", "Limited information about the research": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim was supported by a 2001 article from the Journal of Emergency Medicine. However, the article itself does not provide any specific details about the research methodology or data sources used to arrive at the \"ten percent\" statistic. The lack of comprehensive information about the research behind the claim makes it difficult to assess its validity."}
