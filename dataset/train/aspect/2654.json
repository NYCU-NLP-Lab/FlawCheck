{"Verification of the timeline": "The expert examined the dates mentioned in the video and found that it was uploaded on YouTube in July 2020 and on Facebook in December 2019. This helped establish that the video was not related to Amit Shah contracting coronavirus in August 2020.", "Source analysis": "The expert investigated the sources that shared the video and found that one of them was a page called 'Politics Solitics' which had a history of circulating misinformation. This raised doubts about the credibility of the claim.", "Reverse image search": "A reverse image search was conducted on a frame from the video, which revealed that it had been uploaded on YouTube and Facebook prior to Amit Shah's announcement of being COVID positive. This further supported the conclusion that the video was unrelated to the claim.", "Location analysis": "The expert observed that the video showed barricades with 'Kolkata Traffic Police' written on them, indicating that it was filmed in Kolkata. This information helped establish that the video was not connected to the claim of Muslims celebrating Amit Shah's coronavirus infection."}
