{"Historical data": "The expert analyzed historical data on capital gains tax rates and tax receipts to determine if there is a correlation between raising or cutting the rates and the resulting revenue.", "Expert commentaries": "The expert cited three commentaries from reputable sources, including Investor's Business Daily, the Wall Street Journal, and the Cato Institute. These commentaries provided additional analysis and evidence supporting the claim that raising taxes on investment income lowers revenue, while cutting capital gains tax rates increases revenue.", "Nonpartisan research": "The expert referred to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center's data on capital gains rates and receipts to assess the claim. This research provided an objective perspective on the relationship between tax rates and tax receipts.", "Consideration of other factors": "The expert acknowledged that factors beyond tax rates can influence tax receipts. They recognized that not all gains are subject to the capital gains tax, and that the distribution of capital gains accruals is skewed towards wealthier households. This suggests that other factors, such as the types of assets subject to the tax and the income distribution of taxpayers, may also impact tax revenue."}
