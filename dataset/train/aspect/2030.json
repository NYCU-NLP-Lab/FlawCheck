{"Lack of evidence": "The expert consulted the National Churchill Museum and found no record or evidence to suggest that Winston Churchill made the statement in question. A search on the International Churchill Society website also yielded no results.", "Quote not found prior to 2015": "According to Snopes, the quote in question did not seem to have appeared anywhere prior to 2015, which makes it highly unlikely that it originated from a man who passed away in 1965.", "Quote attributed to Churchill in a list of false quotes": "Richard Langworth, a senior fellow at the Hillsdale College Churchill Project, included the quote in his running list of \"All the \u2018Quotes\u2019 Winston Churchill Never Said.\"", "False rating by fact": "checkers: The expert's verdict states that the claim of Churchill making the quoted statement is false and rates it as \"Pants on Fire!\" This indicates that fact-checkers have determined the claim to be completely untrue."}
