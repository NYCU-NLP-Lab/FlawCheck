{"Analysis of state budget records": "The expert relied on state budget records to examine the financial data during George Allen's tenure as governor of Virginia. This involved analyzing the proposed budgets and comparing them to the previous years' budgets to determine if spending and waste were actually cut.", "Examination of the general fund": "The expert focused on the general fund, which is primarily supported by state income and sales taxes and is responsible for funding public education, health programs, and public safety. By analyzing the changes in the general fund budget during Allen's term, the expert could assess whether there was an increase or decrease in spending and waste.", "Comparison with previous governors": "To provide context and determine the significance of Allen's spending record, the expert compared his general fund growth to that of previous Virginia governors. By noting that Allen's general fund growth was about average compared to the past 30 years, the expert offered a benchmark for evaluating the claim's authenticity.", "Consideration of external factors": "The expert acknowledged that various external factors, such as population growth, increased Medicaid costs, and inflation, contribute to the expansion of the general fund budget over time. By taking these factors into account, the expert assessed whether Allen's proposed budgets and spending decisions were reasonable given the broader economic and social context."}
