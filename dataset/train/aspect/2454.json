{"The claim is supported by the statement made by Chicago Teachers Union President Karen Lewis during her appearance on WTTW": "s Chicago Tonight on Sept. 5, 2017. This statement provides firsthand information about the new Illinois school funding formula and its alleged creation of a tax shelter for the wealthy and a voucher program.", "The claim is further supported by the inclusion of the Invest in Kids Act in the new school funding formula": "The Chicago Teachers Union argues that this act allows for tax credits that effectively function as a voucher program, benefiting private schools and the wealthy.", "The claim is reinforced by the CTU": "s press release and blog posts, where they explicitly describe the scholarship plan as a voucher program and a tax shelter. These statements show the consistent stance of the union on the matter.", "The expert": "s analysis highlights the union's perspective that there is no distinction between calling the Invest in Kids Act a \"scholarship\" program or a \"voucher\" program. This aspect emphasizes the union's belief that the new funding formula includes a voucher-like system."}
