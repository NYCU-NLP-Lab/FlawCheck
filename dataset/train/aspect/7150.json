{"Neighborhood Plan and Rezoning": "The expert mentions that during the creation of the Neighborhood Plan, more than 600 properties in the 78702 ZIP code were rezoned from industrial and commercial to residential. This transformation of the neighborhood is cited as evidence of gentrification.", "Definition of Gentrification": "The expert refers to the definition of gentrify provided by Merriam-Webster, which states that it involves improving and making a place more appealing to wealthier individuals. The process of renewal and rebuilding that accompanies the influx of middle-class or affluent people into deteriorating areas is also mentioned.", "Demographic Changes": "The expert cites a news story from the American-Statesman that describes a demographic transformation in East Austin. It states that the number of African Americans in Central East Austin decreased by 27% over a decade, while the number of white residents increased by 40%. This shift in racial composition is seen as an indicator of gentrification.", "Development Boom and Population Shifts": "The expert mentions a development boom in the last half of the decade that attracted new residents to predominantly low-income, minority neighborhoods in the 78702 ZIP code. Factors such as relatively low property prices, proximity to downtown, and quality of life are cited as reasons for the population shifts. This is presented as further evidence of gentrification in the area."}
