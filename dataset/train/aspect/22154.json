{"Testimony from SCUBA divers": "The claim is supported by the statement that SCUBA divers have declared Summersville Lake as the clearest freshwater lake east of the Mississippi River. This testimonial provides firsthand information from individuals who have explored the lake's underwater environment.", "Reference to the nickname": "The Little Bahamas of the East\": The claim mentions that Summersville Lake has earned this nickname, implying that its clarity is comparable to the clear waters of the Bahamas. This reference adds credibility to the claim, as it suggests that multiple sources recognize the lake's clarity.", "Lack of specific source in WV Tourism article": "The article published by the West Virginia Tourism Office, which is linked in Governor Jim Justice's tweet, does not provide a specific source for the claim. This aspect raises a question about the verifiability of the claim, as the official tourism office did not offer a specific reference to support it.", "Opinion of Peter Oliver": "editor-in-chief of Sources magazine: Peter Oliver, an expert in underwater exploration, states that Summersville Lake has a similar color to most lakes and reservoirs, implying that it does not stand out as exceptionally clear. This expert opinion contradicts the claim and adds another perspective to consider when evaluating the lake's clarity."}
