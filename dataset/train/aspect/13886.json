{"Video evidence contradicts the claim": "The expert's verdict states that conservative blogs accused Democrats of sitting through an ovation for the widow of a slain Navy SEAL during President Trump's address to Congress. However, video evidence shows that the Democrats did stand, although not as long as their Republican counterparts.", "Misleading headlines": "The expert's verdict mentions that headlines from various sources, such as 100PercentFedUp.com and DailyWire.com, suggested that top Democrats refused to stand for the Gold Star widow. However, these headlines were found to be misleading as they did not accurately represent the actual events.", "Photo misinterpretation": "A photo circulated showing U.S. Reps. Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Keith Ellison seated together during the ovation. However, it was later determined that the photo was taken before the ovation occurred, suggesting that it was not an accurate representation of the Democrats' actions.", "Opposition party behavior": "The expert explains that it is fairly typical for the opposition party to not stand for as long as their counterparts during moments like these. Therefore, the Democrats' behavior during the ovation can be seen as within the norm rather than a deliberate act of disrespect."}
