{"The initial public opinion on military action in Libya": "The expert's verdict mentions that before President Obama acted in Libya in 2011, the American people were opposed to military action by 35 to 60.", "Shift in public opinion after military action": "The expert's verdict states that after President Obama took action in Libya, the American people were in support of it by a margin of 54 to 43. This indicates a shift in public opinion towards supporting military action.", "Comparison of public opinion before and after military action": "The expert's verdict highlights Karl Rove's claim that the American people have an animus against any kind of action, but if action is taken and successful, they applaud it. This suggests that the public's opinion changed from opposition to support after witnessing the success of the military action in Libya.", "Polls reflecting changing public opinion": "The expert's verdict mentions specific polls conducted by Fox News and CNN/ORC, which show the change in public opinion over time. The Fox News poll conducted in mid-March 2011 showed only 25 percent in favor of military involvement in Libya, while the CNN/ORC poll conducted by the end of August 2011 showed 54 percent in favor and 43 percent against. These polls serve as evidence of the shift in public opinion."}
