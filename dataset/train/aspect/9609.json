{"The historical context of the claim": "The expert analyzed the history of U.S. taxes, specifically focusing on the introduction of the federal income tax in 1913 after the ratification of the 16th Amendment. They also mentioned that the first federal income tax was imposed during the Civil War but was later scrapped in 1872.", "Verification of income and tax data": "The expert explained that income and tax data from the 1860s, which could have been relevant to Gingrich's claim, is unreliable or nonexistent. They emphasized that comparing such historical data to current statistics would not be valid.", "Analysis of the 1913 federal income tax": "The expert provided information about the tax brackets and rates of the 1913 federal income tax. They explained that even individuals with low income were subject to the tax, but exemptions were available based on income levels. The expert highlighted that Gingrich did not specify the definition of a \"millionaire\" in his claim.", "Consideration of inflation": "The expert mentioned that Gingrich's claim might refer to millionaires in 2010 dollars. They used an online inflation calculator to provide a more favorable calculation for Gingrich's statement. However, it is unclear if Gingrich intended to refer to millionaires in 2010 dollars."}
