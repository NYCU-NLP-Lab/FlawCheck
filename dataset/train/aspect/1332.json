{"The claim states that President Barack Obama signed a bill for more than": "1 billion in Zika funding, but the federal government has only committed $7 million to help Florida. This is verified by the statement made by Florida Gov. Rick Scott in a press statement on Dec. 2, 2016.", "The expert": "s verdict also mentions that Scott's statement about only $7 million heading to Florida does not mention the millions of other federal dollars the state has had access to since the summer to combat Zika. This suggests that there may be additional funding sources or allocations that are not being considered in the claim.", "It is mentioned that Florida applied for": "15 million in funding and received notice that $7.5 million was available, with the remainder subject to the availability of funds. This verifies that there is a portion of the funding that has been committed to Florida, but it may be dependent on the availability of funds."}
