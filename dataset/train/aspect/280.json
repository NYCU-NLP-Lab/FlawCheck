{"The claim is based on a political ad launched by Defend Arizona": "a political action committee supporting conservatives and leaders who have fought for the country.", "The ad cherry": "picks comments made by Kelli Ward in a 2016 radio interview discussing terrorism, where she advocated for the traditional conservative foreign policy of restraint and realism but also expressed the need to \"decimate\" ISIS.", "The ad uses images and videos of ISIS": "related violence, including the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting, to create a sense of threat and urgency.", "The expert": "s verdict confirms that while Ward did mention restraint and realism in her interview, the ad misrepresents her stance by omitting her call to \"decimate\" ISIS, thereby distorting her position on fighting terrorism."}
