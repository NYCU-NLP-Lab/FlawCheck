{"Lack of evidence for a 30": "day plan: Experts have stated that they have never heard of a specific plan for the United States to be in Syria for only 30 days. This is supported by the fact that when the deployment of special operations troops was announced in 2015, there was no specific date given for their withdrawal.", "Contradictory statements from officials": "Officials from both the previous and current administrations have emphasized that the presence of U.S. forces in Syria would be short, limited, and small. However, there has been no official statement indicating that the mission would end after 30 days. This contradicts the claim made by President Trump.", "Expert opinions": "Several experts, including Vera Mironova from Harvard University, Michael E. O'Hanlon from the Brookings Institution, and Steven Heydemann from Smith College, have expressed their skepticism about the 30-day claim. They have called it \"absolutely weird\" and stated that they have never heard of such a plan.", "Dismissal by former envoy and expert": "Brett McGurk, a former special presidential envoy for the global coalition to counter ISIS, who resigned in protest of Trump's decision to withdraw troops from Syria, tweeted that \"none of this is true\" in response to the president's claims. This dismissal by a former envoy with firsthand experience in the matter adds weight to the skepticism surrounding the 30-day claim."}
