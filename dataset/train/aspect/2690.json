{"Comparison of missed votes in 2012": "The expert's verdict mentions that Democratic U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson claimed that Republican U.S. Rep. Connie Mack IV missed 178 votes in 2012. To verify the authenticity of this claim, the expert examined the voting records of both Mack and Nelson for the first three quarters of 2012.", "Comparison of career missed votes": "In addition to looking at the votes missed in 2012, the expert also analyzed the percentage of missed votes throughout Mack's tenure (since January 2005) and Nelson's Senate tenure (since January 2001). This comparison allowed for a broader assessment of their attendance records and provided a context for evaluating the claim.", "Use of official voting information": "The expert relied on GovTrack.us, which tracks missed votes for members of Congress using voting information from the official websites of the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate. This ensured that the data used to verify the claim was accurate and reliable.", "Comparison to other representatives": "The expert also considered the rankings of missed votes among other representatives in the House for the 112th Congress. The New York Times' Inside Congress provided information on the top vote missers during that time period, and it was noted that Mack ranked 13th among Florida representatives. This comparison helped put Mack's attendance record in perspective and provided additional evidence to support or refute the claim."}
