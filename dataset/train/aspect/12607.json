{"Lack of media coverage": "The expert points out that despite the claim being widely shared on social media, there was a complete lack of media coverage on the topic. This suggests that there was no credible source or evidence to support the claim.", "No official confirmation": "The expert states that they were unable to confirm the underlying assertion that Fox News had been deemed \"propaganda\" by officials in Australia or New Zealand. This indicates that there was no official statement or action taken by the authorities to ban the channel.", "Freedom of the press": "The expert highlights that both Australia and New Zealand have provisions for freedom of the press, although not explicitly guaranteed as a constitutional right. This suggests that it would be unlikely for a news station to be outright banned based on the grounds of being deemed \"propaganda.\"", "Broadcast regulations": "The expert consults a New Zealand law professor who explains that broadcasters in both countries are bound by codes that require accuracy, fairness, and lawful content. While there are provisions for public complaints and penalties for violations, the professor confirms that there is no basis in the laws of either country to ban a news station outright. This further undermines the authenticity of the claim."}
