{"The discrepancy in the vote count between the first and second screenshots": "The expert's verdict highlights that the first screenshot shows Ferdinand Marcos Jr. with over 33 million votes, while the second screenshot shows his vote count reduced to 13 million. This inconsistency raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Alterations in the first screenshot": "The expert's analysis reveals that the first screenshot has been manipulated to show Marcos with a supposed 20-million vote lead over Leni Robredo. This alteration further undermines the credibility of the claim.", "Lack of evidence for the claimed broadcast time": "The expert points out that the purported screenshots were said to be from a News5 broadcast at 10:20 pm. However, the genuine broadcast footage obtained by AFP shows that no vote tally was displayed at that time. This discrepancy casts doubt on the accuracy of the claim.", "Testimony from News5 anchor Ed Lingao": "The expert's verdict mentions that Ed Lingao, an anchor from News5, had previously debunked the same photo when similar misleading posts circulated online. Lingao explained that the stock market report in the background of the screenshots remained the same from 10:20 pm to 10:29 pm, indicating that the alleged vote count changes were not possible on live television. This testimony from a credible source further discredits the claim."}
