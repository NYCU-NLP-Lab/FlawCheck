{"Lack of official attendance number": "The expert's verdict mentions that no official attendance number has been released for President Trump's rally in Butler, Pa. This indicates that there is no authoritative source to confirm the claim of over 57,000 people attending the rally.", "Estimates from law enforcement and media": "The Penn Township Police Department estimated that there were about 15,000 people in attendance at the rally. The Butler Eagle, the county's daily newspaper, reported that \"more than 10,000 people\" showed up. The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review mentioned that bus drivers were told to expect about 15,000 attendees. These estimates from law enforcement and media sources provide alternative figures that contradict the claim.", "Source of the inflated number": "The expert's verdict mentions that the 57,000 figure seems to stem from a tweet by Sebastian Gorka, a former White House aide in the Trump administration. However, there is no confirmation or verification of this number from any official or reliable source.", "Lack of response from relevant parties": "The expert's verdict states that attempts were made to reach out to the Secret Service, Trump campaign, and Butler County for verification of the attendance number, but no response was received. The lack of response from these relevant parties raises doubts about the credibility of the claim."}
