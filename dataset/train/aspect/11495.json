The report, published by LLOD, described Kaepernick's actions as a publicity stunt and portrayed him as a \"traitorous cretin\" and an \"anti-American troublemaker.\" However, it was later revealed that there was no actual arrest, and the report was fabricated.", "False statement of Nike firing Kaepernick": "The claim also included a false statement that Nike had fired Kaepernick because of his on-field stunt.
