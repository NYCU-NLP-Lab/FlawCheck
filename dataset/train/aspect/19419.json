{"The claim states that Congressman Charlie Bass took over": "166,000 from Big Oil. The first aspect employed to verify the authenticity of this claim is the analysis of campaign finance data provided by the Center for Responsive Politics. The data shows that Bass has accepted about $7.5 million in donations from PACs and individuals throughout his career, with $147,660 coming from donors within the oil and gas industry.", "The Public Campaign Action Fund": "a non-profit group that seeks to improve campaign finance laws, conducted a thorough review of the campaign finance data provided by the Center for Responsive Politics. The Action Fund's analysis supports the claim that Bass has received significant donations from the oil and gas industry.", "Russ Choma": "a reporter with OpenSecrets, confirms that the $147,660 reported by the Center for Responsive Politics is only the amount of donations over $200. Choma suggests that there may be additional donations below $200 that are not tracked in the same way, indicating that the actual amount received from the oil and gas industry could be higher.", "The Friends of Democracy": "a political action committee pushing for campaign finance reform, is spending $700,000 to air a series of ads accusing Bass and three other Congressmen of accepting money from oil and gas companies. While the analysis of campaign finance data provides evidence to support the claim, the fact that a PAC is actively promoting this accusation adds further credibility to the claim's authenticity."}
