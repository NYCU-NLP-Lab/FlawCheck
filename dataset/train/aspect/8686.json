{"Hair stylists in New Jersey are required to be licensed by the State Board of Cosmetology and Hairstyling": "which involves completing an educational course and passing an exam conducted by the board.", "There are no existing state regulations specifically for": "foreclosure consultants\" in New Jersey because the term is not defined under state law.", "The bill sponsored by Assemblyman Gary Schaer": "called the \"Foreclosure Rescue Fraud Prevention Act,\" aims to regulate foreclosure consultants by requiring them to obtain a license from the Commissioner of Banking & Insurance and undergo a criminal background check.", "While hair stylists face established regulations and licensing requirements": "individuals providing similar consulting services as \"debt adjusters\" are subject to state regulations, and a federal law already imposes requirements similar to those proposed under Schaer's bill."}
