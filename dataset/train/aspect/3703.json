{"Use of stock photos": "The expert noticed that the images of the tiny houses used in the Facebook posts were stock photos commonly found on platforms like Pinterest. This raised doubts about the authenticity of the claim as it is unlikely for a contest prize to be a stock photo.", "Lack of association with reputable companies": "The Facebook pages running the giveaway contests were not linked with any major home improvement company or commercial entity that would typically offer such prizes in exchange for social media advertising. This lack of association with reputable companies cast doubt on the legitimacy of the claim.", "Similar instructions across multiple posts": "The expert observed that although the visuals of the tiny houses varied in different posts, the instructions for participating in the giveaway were virtually identical. This lack of variation in the instructions suggested a standardized format used to entice users, which is common in like-farming scams.", "Similarities with other known scams": "The expert recognized similarities between the tiny house giveaway scams and other scams involving gift cards from reputable companies like Costco, Kroger, and Amazon. The presence of a large jackpot and the use of \"like farming\" tactics to quickly build and sell popular Facebook pages indicated that the tiny house giveaways were likely part of a scam."}
