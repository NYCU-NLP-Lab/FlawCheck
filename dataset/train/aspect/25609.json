{"The image was manipulated": "The expert's verdict states that the image circulating on Facebook, which shows a CNN chyron calling Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi an \"unarmed father of three,\" was manipulated. This suggests that the authenticity of the claim is questioned based on the altered image.", "Lack of evidence in CNN captions and archives": "The expert's verdict mentions that CNN captions and archives were checked, but no mention of the word \"unarmed\" or a matching chyron was found. This indicates that there is no evidence to support the claim made in the image.", "Timing discrepancy": "The expert's verdict points out the timing of the chyron shown in the image. It is stated that the clip shows a time of 9:01pmET, while the host's show airs from 10pm to midnight. This discrepancy raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Confirmation from CNN representative": "The expert's verdict includes a statement from Christal Jones, a senior public relations manager at CNN, who confirms that the claim is fake. This adds credibility to the conclusion that the image and the associated claim are not authentic."}
