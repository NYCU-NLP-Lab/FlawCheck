{"Confirmation from U": "S. Army Europe Deputy Commanding General: The expert's verdict mentions that U.S. Army Europe Deputy Commanding General Andrew M. Rohling addressed the media during a press conference in Berlin on January 14, 2020, regarding the Defender 2020 military exercise. This indicates that the deployment of troops to Europe was part of a planned military exercise and not related to the claim of rescuing children or arresting deep state members.", "Scaling back of the exercise due to COVID": "19 concerns: The expert's verdict states that the exercise involving the deployment of troops to Europe was scaled back due to COVID-19 concerns. This suggests that the primary purpose of the deployment was not related to the claim of freeing child-trafficked children or arresting deep state cabal members.", "Lack of evidence for excavating secret military bases or arresting deep state members": "The expert's verdict clearly mentions that there is no evidence to support the claim that the deployed troops were involved in excavating secret military bases, freeing children, or arresting members of the deep state. This indicates that the claim lacks substantiation.", "Association with baseless QAnon conspiracy theory": "The expert's verdict highlights that the allegations made in the claim are tied to the baseless QAnon conspiracy theory. This theory promotes unfounded beliefs about prominent Democrats and Hollywood celebrities being involved in satanic rituals and pedophilia. The association with this conspiracy theory further discredits the authenticity of the claim."}
