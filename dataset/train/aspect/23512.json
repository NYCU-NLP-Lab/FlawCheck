{"The expert mentions that the statistic closest to the claim is the median wage or salary for workers who are paid through wages or salaries": "which is calculated by the Census Bureau and adjusted for inflation.", "The expert points out that the median wage for women in 2008": "the last year before Obama took office, was $28,574, and by 2014, it had risen to $29,098 in inflation-adjusted dollars. This shows an increase of $524 over six years, contradicting Cruz's claim of a $733 drop.", "The expert also mentions that the Census Bureau separately calculates inflation": "adjusted median income by gender. According to this measure, the figure for women in 2008 was $22,945, and by 2014, it had fallen to $22,240, a decline of $705, which is close to what Cruz said.", "The expert highlights that Cruz specifically mentioned wages": "but the income statistic takes into account a much larger mix of income flows, including various sources such as commissions, bonuses, tips, self-employment income, and more. This makes Cruz's statement less accurate as he focused only on wages."}
