{"The claim is based on a report published by the Center for American Progress": "a liberal think tank, which used a model developed by Urban Institute health care scholar John Holahan. The report estimated the number of people who can expect to lose their insurance when the national unemployment rate goes up.", "Holahan": "s model took into account various factors such as the baseline unemployment rate in 2007, the estimated number of people who would lose coverage at different unemployment rates, and the potential for individuals to switch to a spouse's plan or extend coverage through COBRA.", "The White House confirmed that the claim originated from the Center for American Progress report and the model developed by Holahan": "This adds credibility to the claim as it is based on research conducted by reputable institutions.", "PolitiFact had previously rated a similar statement by President Barack Obama as Mostly True": "further supporting the authenticity of the claim.
