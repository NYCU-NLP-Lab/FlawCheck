{"The claim is related to a specific vote made by Congressman Nye against a bill that would have defunded the IRS to implement and enforce the health care legislation": "2. The claim is supported by a release on Scott Rigell's website, the Republican challenger for Virginia's 2nd District seat, critiquing Nye's performance following a debate.", "The claim is based on a procedural vote on a rule held during consideration of HR 5175": "the Democracy is Strengthened by Casting Light on Spending in Elections Act, where Republicans attempted to introduce a bill that would have blocked IRS funding to enforce the health care law.", "The expert explains that Nye": "s vote against the procedural motion was to proceed with the scheduled agenda rather than allowing Republicans to hijack the floor during a rules vote, and it does not guarantee the elimination of funds for the IRS."}
