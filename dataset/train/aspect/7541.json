{"The presence of uranium": "rich gold fields in Johannesburg: The claim is based on the fact that the gold mines in Johannesburg have concentrated uranium deposits, with mined reefs containing significantly higher levels of uranium compared to gold.", "Uranium contamination versus radioactivity": "The expert's verdict highlights the distinction between uranium contamination and radioactivity. While Johannesburg may be the most uranium-contaminated city due to its mining history, this does not directly correlate with it having the highest levels of radiation.", "Lack of consistent measuring of radioactivity": "The expert points out that there has been no consistent measuring of radioactivity in Johannesburg. This suggests that there is limited data available to support the claim of it being the most radioactive city on Earth.", "Higher levels of radioactivity in other cities": "The available data shows that the Iranian city of Ramsar has higher levels of radioactivity compared to Johannesburg. This indicates that there are other cities with potentially higher radiation levels, casting doubt on the claim."}
