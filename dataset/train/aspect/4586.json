{"The claim was verified by examining estimates from the U": "S. Treasury and the Office of Management and Budget. These projections showed that allowing the tax cuts for the wealthy to expire would generate additional tax revenue of $74.4 billion over two years, including adjustments to capital gains and dividends.", "The expert also considered the exclusion of the capital gains and dividends change": "as suggested by Warner's communication director. Without these adjustments, the two-year total of additional tax revenue would be closer to $57 billion.", "The expert mentioned that the figures provided by the Treasury were based on estimates that have since been revised": "This indicates that the authenticity of the claim was verified using the most recent and updated data available.", "The expert consulted with Gerald Prante": "a senior economist with the nonpartisan Tax Foundation, who disagreed with Warner's exclusion of capital gains from the calculations. This suggests that multiple perspectives were considered in verifying the authenticity of the claim."}
