{"The ad produced by the conservative Florida Strong PAC blames Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum for a murder spike in his city": "using a creepy voiceover reminiscent of Gollum from The Lord of the Rings.", "The ad claims that Gillum": "oversaw a 52 percent increase in murder\" in Tallahassee. However, fact-checkers have found that the PAC cherry-picked data to make the city appear as a growing hotbed for murder. The number of murders during Gillum's tenure as mayor ranged from 11 to 17 deaths in four years, showing little overall change.", "It is important to note that Tallahassee has a weak mayor form of government": "meaning Gillum is just one vote on the commission. Pinning the responsibility solely on Gillum for the city's murder rate is an exaggeration.", "Criminologists": "such as Brian Stults from Florida State University, have analyzed the data and concluded that the risk of being murdered in Tallahassee is very low in both periods examined. Small random fluctuations from year to year can lead to dramatic changes in the murder rate that are not as substantial as they may seem."}
