{"The video clip shows a replica of the iconic rampart of Delhi": "s Red Fort passing by during the Republic Day parade, with the sound of the Islamic prayer call \"Allahu Akbar\" in the background.", "The caption accompanying the video claims that the Delhi Government": "led by Arvind Kejriwal, had a tableau on Republic Day with the Islamic prayer call, implying that it was promoting the worship of \"false gods\" and referring to Delhi as \"Sultano ki Delhi\" (Sultans' Delhi), which could be interpreted as a reference to the Islamic empire that ruled Delhi in the past.", "The video clip was shared on social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter by various individuals": "including Indian film actress Kangana Ranaut and columnist Shefali Vaidya, who expressed outrage and criticized the presence of the Islamic prayer call during the Republic Day parade.", "A closer analysis of the video revealed that it had been misleadingly edited": "The full video of the floats representing Indian states at the Republic Day parade, published on India's state-run broadcaster Doordarshan's YouTube channel, showed that the Red Fort tableau representing Delhi passed through after the tableau for Uttar Pradesh, with a narration mentioning the theme of the Delhi tableau as the \"Shahjahanabad - redevelopment project\" and referring to the inclusive streets and public plazas, rather than solely focusing on the Islamic prayer call."}
