{"The claim is based on an article published by Vanity Fair": "which reported that President Trump's lawyers had made a legal argument to prevent the release of his tax returns. The article summarized the argument as stating that it is illegal to investigate a sitting president for any crimes he may have committed.", "The article did not directly quote President Trump or his representatives admitting any criminal action on his part": "The legal argument was attributed to the president's lawyers, not the president himself.", "The lawsuit filed against Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr": "by President Trump's lawyers claimed that the request for his tax returns was unconstitutional because the founding fathers believed sitting presidents should not be subject to the criminal process. The suit argued that such investigations would distract the president from his constitutional duties.", "The headline of the Vanity Fair article": "Trump: My Crimes Can't Be Investigated While I'm President,\" created a misleading impression that President Trump himself had made the statement, when in fact it was a summary of the argument made by his lawyers."}
