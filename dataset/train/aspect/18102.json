This raised doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Non": "existent individuals: The expert could not find any record of the so-called \"political analyst and Middle Eastern expert\" named Dave Wellsborough mentioned in the article. This raised concerns about the credibility of the sources and the information presented.", "Unverified quotes": "The expert mentioned that despite the proliferation of a quote attributed to Quranic scholar Zakir Naik on the internet, they were unable to confirm that he ever claimed that bestiality is permitted in Islam. This highlighted the need for verification of quotes and the potential for misinformation.", "Satirical nature of the source": "The expert noted that the original article was from a self-styled \"satirical\" website called World News Daily Report.
