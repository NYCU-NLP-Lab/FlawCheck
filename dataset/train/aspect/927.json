{"Carlos Gimenez slashed his own salary from": "230,000 to $150,000 when he first took office as Miami-Dade mayor in 2011.", "After seven years": "the county commission agreed to raise Gimenez's pay to $250,000 at his request, which was a 67% increase.", "Gimenez had a car allowance for a Mercedes": "Benz when he was a county commissioner, but he personally took over the lease when he became mayor.", "The claim that Gimenez kept his taxpayer": "funded Mercedes-Benz after slashing $400 million in government jobs and spending is misleading, as the car allowance was from about a decade ago and not during his tenure as mayor."}
