This further supports the claim that the tweet is fabricated.", "Confirmation from Cruz": "s communications adviser: Steve Guest, a communications adviser for Ted Cruz, confirmed in an email to the expert that the tweet is fake. This adds credibility to the assertion that the tweet was not authored by Cruz.", "Misinformation spread on social media": "Despite the lack of evidence and confirmation of the tweet's authenticity, the expert notes that well-followed, often left-leaning social media accounts shared the screenshot, treating it as authentic.
