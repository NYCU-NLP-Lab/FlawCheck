{"Lack of trace in Nuremberg trials archive": "The expert found that there is no record or trace of the purported quote attributed to Hermann Goering in the official Nuremberg trials archive, both in English and German versions.", "Circulation of the claim in multiple languages": "The claim has been circulating not only in English but also in French and Polish, indicating its widespread dissemination across different regions.", "Connection to conspiracy theories": "The expert noted that the claim emerged after Robert Kennedy Jr., known for spreading conspiracy theories about the pandemic, attributed a similar quote to Goering during a demonstration against Covid-19 measures in Berlin. This connection raises doubts about the credibility of the claim.", "Alternative quote from Goering": "The expert found a different quote from Goering in the book \"Nuremberg Diary\" by G.M. Gilbert, where Goering reportedly stated that fear can be used by governments to control people in various regimes, including democracies. This alternative quote suggests that the claim might be a misinterpretation or misattribution."}
