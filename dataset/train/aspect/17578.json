{"The expert analyzed the statement made by Rubio during the debate": "where he claimed that 211,000 Floridians have lost their jobs since the governor campaigned with Barack Obama on behalf of the stimulus program. This claim was the basis for verifying the authenticity of the statement.", "The expert referred to a report released by the state": "s Agency for Workforce Innovation, which provided employment figures for Florida. The report showed that there was a difference of 231,000 jobs between February 2009 and February 2010, supporting Rubio's claim.", "The expert also considered the seasonally adjusted nonagricultural employment numbers": "which showed a job loss of 211,500 in a year's time. This further supported Rubio's claim and provided additional evidence for the authenticity of the statement.", "In addition to the state report": "the expert mentioned a report from House Way and Means Republicans, which highlighted the stimulus as a job-killer rather than a job creator. This report stated that Florida had lost 240,400 jobs since the stimulus passed, further reinforcing Rubio's claim."}
