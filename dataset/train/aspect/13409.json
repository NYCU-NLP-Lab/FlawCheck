{"The claim states that under Texas law": "it takes six years to close a failing school.", "The expert": "s investigation found that the Texas Education Agency spokesperson confirmed that it takes six years of \"unacceptable\" academic ratings before the Texas schools commissioner is required to shut down a campus.", "The expert also discovered that by law": "the commissioner can close a school for purely academic reasons after three years, which includes two years of academically unacceptable ratings plus one year in which the school fails to successfully implement a reconstitution plan.", "Additionally": "the expert found that if a school receives three consecutive \"unacceptable\" ratings after reconstitution, the law mandates the commissioner to order the campus to be repurposed, put under alternative management, or closed. The only exception is if the school is expected to improve its rating in the following year, in which case the commissioner can grant an additional year's leeway, bringing the maximum time to six years."}
