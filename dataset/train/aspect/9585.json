{"The video was not shot during the recent unrest in Venezuela": "but rather during a previous anti-Maduro protest called \"The Taking of Caracas\" on September 1, 2016. This was verified through a reverse media search and the earliest iteration of the video found by AFP was from that time.", "A Brazilian politician close to the far right": "Fernando Holiday, published the same video on Facebook 15 minutes before it was shared on Twitter. This indicates that the video had been circulating for some time and was not a recent recording.", "The claim that the video shows a protest demanding Maduro": "s resignation after Juan Guaido declared himself \"acting president\" on January 23, 2019, is not accurate. The protesters on that day were actually marking the anniversary of the 1958 coup d'etat that toppled Venezuelan dictator Marcos Perez Jimenez.", "The video": "s authenticity was further confirmed by opposition leader Henrique Capriles, who had shared the video during the original protest in 2016. This adds credibility to the fact that the video is indeed from that time period."}
