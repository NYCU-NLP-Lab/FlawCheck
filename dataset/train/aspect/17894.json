{"The expert referred to the U": "S. Department of Agriculture's census survey of farms conducted every five years, which provided data on the number of Christmas trees harvested in each state in 2007. This data was used to determine if Christmas trees are grown in all 50 states.", "The expert also consulted Catherine Howard": "publisher of Christmas Trees Magazine, who provided insights based on her knowledge of the industry. While she did not have definitive information on whether there are tree farms in all 50 states, she mentioned that certain states, such as the Dakotas, Montana, Arizona, and New Mexico, may have fewer or no growers due to the difficulty of growing Christmas trees in those regions.", "The expert checked several websites": "including the National Christmas Tree Association and the Christmas Tree Farm Network, to find places where fresh-cut trees are available for purchase. While these websites did not list any members in certain states like Wyoming, New Mexico, North Dakota, or Alaska, it was acknowledged that the information may not be comprehensive.", "The expert acknowledged that despite the efforts made to verify the claim": "there was still uncertainty and difficulty in determining definitively whether Christmas trees are grown in all 50 states. Some states were identified as potentially lacking tree farms, but no concrete evidence was found to confirm or refute the claim."}
