{"Analysis by Kaiser Health News": "The expert's verdict mentions that an analysis by Kaiser Health News showed that New York state has received less funding compared to less-affected states in the first round of federal funding for health care providers. This analysis supports the claim's assertion about the disparity in funding.", "Funding source clarification": "The expert's verdict points out that Cuomo's claim overlooks the distinction between states and the health care providers within those states. The funding source mentioned in the claim sends money directly to providers, not to states. This aspect verifies that the claim's interpretation of the funding is incorrect.", "Subsequent funding favoring higher case load states": "The expert's verdict states that subsequent batches of funding are supposed to favor states with higher coronavirus case loads. This aspect supports the claim's argument that New York, being the hardest-hit state, should receive more funding per case.", "Credible study and accurate comparison": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim relies on a credible study of how one part of the federal funding is being divided among the states. It also acknowledges that at the time of the claim, the difference in funding between New York and the other two states (Montana and Nebraska) was indeed lopsided. This aspect confirms the accuracy of the claim's comparison between the funding received by different states."}
