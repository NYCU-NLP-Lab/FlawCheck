{"The website Uspoln fabricated a statement attributed to Rick Santorum about abortion": "2. Rick Santorum has consistently been against abortion in all cases, including rape and incest.", "The claim that Santorum made the statement on": "Piers Morgan Live\" in mid-February is false, as Morgan has been off the air since 2014.", "The actual statement made by Santorum on the show was about accepting the pregnancy resulting from rape as a gift of human life in a broken way": "not specifically about God comforting rape victims."}
