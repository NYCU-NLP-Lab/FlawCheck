{"The source of the claim": "The expert's verdict mentions that Governor Rick Perry made the claim during various media appearances. The claim was based on a Dun & Bradstreet (D&B) analysis of California business migration from January 2010 to August 2010.", "Verification from D": "B: The expert's verdict includes information from Mark Muckerman, D&B government relations director, who confirmed that the company conducted an internal exercise on interstate moves of business locations. Muckerman stated that 153 businesses relocated from California to Texas during the specified time period.", "Limitations of the count": "Muckerman clarified that the count of 153 businesses does not necessarily mean that 153 individual companies moved from California to Texas. He provided an example of how one company with multiple offices in California could contribute to the count if it relocated some branches to Texas.", "Exclusion of new business locations": "Muckerman also mentioned that the D&B analysis focused on interstate moves and did not include new business locations. Therefore, if a California company decided to open a new facility in Texas, it would not be counted among the businesses that moved from California to Texas."}
