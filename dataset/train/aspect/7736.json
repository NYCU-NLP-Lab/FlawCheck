{"The expert analyzed the DMK manifesto and found that there were no references to encroached Waqf properties being reclaimed and handed over to the Waqf board or temple lands being transferred to encroachers": "This contradicted the claim made in the tweet by Madhu Kishwar.", "The expert accessed the English version of the DMK manifesto and confirmed that it was only 76 pages long": "There were no pages 85 and 112 as mentioned in the claim. This further discredited the claim made by Kishwar.", "Alt News": "a fact-checking organization, also found no reference to the Waqf board or encroachment of temple lands in the DMK manifesto. The only section related to religious matters was the concluding section titled 'PROTECTION OF RELIGIONS AND RELIGIOUS HARMONY' on page 69.", "The expert discovered that the reference to the protection of Waqf board properties and temple lands was actually from the DMK manifesto of 2016": "not the current manifesto for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. This showed that the claim made by Kishwar was based on outdated information."}
