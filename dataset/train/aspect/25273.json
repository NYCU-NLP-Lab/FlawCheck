{"Official election results": "The expert analyzed the official results from the election and found that none of the Michigan voting jurisdictions listed in the affidavit had a turnout of 100% or higher. This indicates that the claim of 100% turnout in certain precincts is not supported by the official data.", "Inaccurate analysis": "The expert pointed out that the affidavit from Russell James Ramsland Jr., the source of the claim, contains flawed analysis. Ramsland mistakenly identified voting jurisdictions in Minnesota as Michigan towns in a separate analysis of voter turnout. This raises doubts about the accuracy and credibility of the analysis used to support the claim.", "Discrepancy with official turnout rates": "The expert compared the claimed turnout rates in the affidavit with the official turnout rates reported by election officials. For example, the claim states a turnout of 139.29% in Detroit, while the official results show a turnout of 50.88% of registered voters. This significant discrepancy further undermines the authenticity of the claim.", "Implausible turnout rates": "The expert highlighted the implausibility of the claimed turnout rates above 100%, such as 782% in the City of North Muskegon and 461% in Zeeland Charter Township. It is highly unlikely that such extreme turnout rates would have gone unnoticed or escaped the attention of election officials. This inconsistency raises doubts about the accuracy and reliability of the claim."}
