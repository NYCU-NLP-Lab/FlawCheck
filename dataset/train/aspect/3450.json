{"The expert refers to the U": "S. Navy\u2019s History and Heritage Command's list of the use of U.S. forces abroad from 1798 to 1993, which shows that American forces were active on overseas missions 16 times during the Reagan administration in a total of 12 countries.", "The expert mentions specific instances where U": "S. forces took a more direct role, such as the strikes on Libya in 1986 and the escorting of Kuwaiti tankers in the Persian Gulf in 1987 and 1988.", "The expert highlights that the U": "S. Navy ships escorting Kuwaiti tankers encountered military action six times, including being fired upon and hitting mines, indicating a more active involvement in conflicts.", "The expert notes that the U": "S. Navy's list does not distinguish between deployments into areas with open conflict and those that were more tranquil, suggesting that the claim of Reagan's forces being involved in conflict only once in Grenada may not be accurate."}
