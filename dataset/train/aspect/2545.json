{"Historical use of wood pipes in the natural gas industry": "The expert mentions that wood pipes were used in the early history of natural gas distribution, citing an example from 1821 in Fredonia, N.Y. This historical context provides evidence that wood pipes were indeed used in the past.", "Transition from iron to steel and plastic pipes": "The expert explains that in the early 20th century, wrought or cast iron pipes were commonly used, but steel replaced them in the 1950s. Since the 1980s, plastic pipes have become increasingly popular due to their non-corroding nature. This information highlights the shift away from wood pipes towards more durable materials.", "Current pipe materials used in the U": "S.: The expert states that plastic pipes currently account for almost 51 percent of the pipes used in the U.S., while various types of steel account for 46 percent, and cast or wrought iron account for about 3 percent. This data suggests that wood pipes are not commonly used in the present-day natural gas distribution system.", "Lack of recent evidence or data on wood pipes": "The expert does not provide any recent evidence or data to support the claim that wood pipes are currently in use for natural gas distribution. By not presenting any current information, it implies that wood pipes are not a significant aspect of the authenticity of the claim."}
