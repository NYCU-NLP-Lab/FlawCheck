{"The article specified that the claim was based on a letter written by Cardinal Ratzinger in 2004": "prior to his elevation to papal status. This letter did not mention Hillary Clinton and did not forbid Catholics from voting for her or anyone who espouses her ideas.", "The current Pope": "Pope Francis, did not issue any edict forbidding Catholics from voting for Hillary Clinton or any specific candidate. The claim falsely attributed the decree to him.", "The article highlighted the fact that many readers inferred the claim to be a recent papal edict issued by Pope Francis": "despite the headline specifying Pope Benedict XVI. This suggests that the misunderstanding and misinterpretation of the claim contributed to its inauthenticity.", "The expert": "s verdict included excerpts from official Church teachings, such as the Instruction \"Redemptionis Sacramentum,\" which emphasized the importance of conscious decision-making and objective criteria for receiving Holy Communion. These teachings did not mention anything about forbidding Catholics from voting for specific candidates but focused on the worthiness and preparation for receiving Holy Communion."}
