{"Lack of official metric": "The expert mentions that there is no official metric or specific legal definition of sanctuary cities. This implies that there is no official record or criteria to determine whether Florida had five sanctuary cities during Jeb Bush's time in office.", "Inconsistent claims": "The expert highlights that while Donald Trump claimed that Jeb Bush had five sanctuary cities in Florida, there is no evidence or official sources to support this claim. This suggests that the claim made by Trump may be inconsistent or unsubstantiated.", "Search for lists of sanctuary cities": "The expert mentions that they reached out to both Trump's campaign and Bush's people for clarification but did not receive any response. As a result, they went in search of lists of sanctuary cities to verify the claim. This indicates that the expert actively sought out relevant information to assess the accuracy of the claim.", "Finding a comprehensive list": "The expert found a list created by the Ohio Jobs and Justice PAC, which claimed to be the most comprehensive list of sanctuary cities. This list included five Florida locations. However, the expert also identified issues with the list, such as the inclusion of a location that was not even a town. This suggests that the credibility and accuracy of the list may be questionable."}
