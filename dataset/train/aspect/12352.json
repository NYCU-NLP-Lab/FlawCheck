{"Bureau of Labor Statistics data": "The expert verified the claim by referring to the Bureau of Labor Statistics data, which reported a gain of 327,000 jobs in manufacturing between July 2017 and July 2018, supporting the claim made in the tweet.", "Comparison with previous years": "The expert compared the manufacturing job gains in the past 12-month period to previous years, specifically looking at July-to-July gains or losses in manufacturing jobs since 1994-95. The analysis showed that the 2018 performance was the best during that period, further validating the claim.", "Comparison with previous high": "The expert also compared the job gains in the past 12-month period to the previous high in manufacturing job growth, which occurred in April 1995 with a gain of 345,000 jobs. This comparison confirmed that the recent gain of 327,000 jobs was indeed the most in any 12-month period since 1995.", "Long": "term perspective: The expert provided a long-term perspective on manufacturing employment in the United States, highlighting that while there has been some recovery since the 1980s and the Great Recession, manufacturing jobs have been slowly recovering. This broader context helps to understand the significance of the recent job gains and the limitations of attributing them solely to President Trump and Republicans."}
