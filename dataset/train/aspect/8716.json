{"The presence of 130 new businesses": "The expert questions the authenticity of the claim by questioning whether there are really 130 new businesses in Texas dedicated to helicopter hog hunts. They provide evidence from the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department and the Agriculture Commissioner's office to suggest that this number may be inaccurate.", "Lack of documentation": "The expert highlights that the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department does not have records indicating the exact number of hog-hunting operations that emerged after the law was passed. This lack of documentation makes it difficult to verify the claim.", "Aerial Wildlife Management Permits": "The expert mentions that there were 140 active/valid Aerial Wildlife Management Permits at the time of inquiry, with 104 of them indicating a commercial purpose. These permits are seen as a potential indicator of businesses offering helicopter hog hunts, but it is not clear if all of them are actually engaged in this activity.", "Provider skepticism": "The expert also includes statements from some providers of helicopter hog hunts who express doubt about the claim of 130 new businesses. While this is not definitive proof, their skepticism adds to the overall questioning of the claim's authenticity."}
