{"Lack of evidence": "The expert's verdict highlights the absence of any evidence supporting Trump's claim that he recommended Ohio as the site for the Republican National Convention. Despite reaching out to Trump's campaign and the RNC communications office, no evidence was provided to verify the claim.", "Testimonies from committee members": "The expert mentions that Sandy Boehler, a member of the RNC Convention Site Selection Committee, stated that she was never contacted by the Trump campaign regarding the choice of Ohio. Additionally, Steve Duprey, another committee member, expressed his unawareness of Trump's recommendation.", "Timing of Trump": "s candidacy: The expert points out that Trump declared his presidential candidacy in June 2015, almost a year after Cleveland was selected as the convention site in July 2014. This timeline suggests that Trump's claim may be unfounded, as he was not a candidate at the time of the site selection.", "Ohio": "s strong chance: The expert notes that Ohio had a strong chance of being selected from the beginning, as three of the original eight cities under consideration for the convention were from Ohio. This implies that Ohio's selection was already likely, diminishing the significance of Trump's alleged recommendation."}
