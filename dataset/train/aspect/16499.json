{"The video was originally shared on the Big Bend Ranch State Park": "Texas Parks and Wildlife Facebook page in October 2018, indicating its source and providing a potential starting point for verification.", "The caption accompanying the video stated that tarantulas can swim": "with their legs acting as paddles, suggesting that this behavior is not uncommon or unheard of.", "Scientific research has confirmed that tarantulas can indeed swim": "although it is not their preferred mode of travel and is typically a survival mechanism rather than a regular behavior.", "Other types of spiders": "such as the dolomedes briangreenei, are known to be comfortable in aquatic environments and actively hunt insects on the water, providing additional evidence for the possibility of tarantulas swimming."}
