{"The expert mentions the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program": "VICP) as a source of data to verify the authenticity of the claim. The VICP is a federal claims court that settles cases of alleged vaccine injury and provides compensation to individuals found to be injured by certain vaccines.", "The expert explains that the VICP was established in 1986 as part of a compromise between vaccine producers and the federal government": "Its primary objectives are to ensure an adequate supply of vaccines, stabilize vaccine costs, and establish an accessible and efficient forum for individuals found to be injured by vaccines.", "The expert states that the VICP frequently settles cases through compensation": "but this compensation is rarely issued as a result of findings that scientifically or medically tie a vaccine to an alleged injury. The expert cites a report by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) which states that almost 75 percent of all compensation awarded by the VICP comes from negotiated settlements, where the HHS has not concluded that the alleged vaccine caused the alleged injury.", "The expert highlights that anti": "vaccine websites often misuse cases from the VICP to support their claims. These websites may selectively cite cases in which compensation was awarded, without considering that the compensation does not necessarily indicate a scientific or medical link between the vaccine and the alleged injury. The expert mentions a specific example of a post from the \"Health Impact News\" website that falsely claims the flu shot is the most dangerous vaccine in America based on settled cases for injuries."}
