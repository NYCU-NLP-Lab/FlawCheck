{"Lack of official category or definition for": "inner-city\" crime: The expert points out that there is no official category or definition for \"inner-city\" crime, making it difficult to measure or verify Trump's claim accurately.", "Analysis of crime data in large cities": "To assess the claim, the expert analyzes crime data collected by the FBI for cities with a population over 250,000, as it is the closest available measure for \"inner-city\" crime.", "Examination of violent crime rates": "The expert uses the rate of all violent crimes, including homicides, rapes, robberies, and aggravated assaults, per 100,000 people as a standard measurement of crime extent. The data shows a decline in violent crime rates since the early-to-mid 1990s, contradicting Trump's claim of record levels.", "Examination of homicide rates": "The expert also examines the subset of the homicide rate for both the country as a whole and cities over 250,000 in population. Similar to the overall violent crime rates, the data reveals a decline in homicide rates since the early-to-mid 1990s, further contradicting Trump's claim."}
