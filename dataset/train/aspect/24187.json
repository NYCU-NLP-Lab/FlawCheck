{"Lack of verifiable source": "The expert noted that despite the popularity of the quote, no written record or credible source attributing it to William Shakespeare could be found. This lack of verifiable source raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Variation in wording": "The expert mentioned that the exact wording of the quote can change from post to post, indicating that it may have been altered or adapted over time. This variation in wording adds to the uncertainty surrounding the claim's authenticity.", "Attribution to another author": "The expert discovered that a portion of the quote, specifically the section starting with \"before you write\" and ending with \"before you die,\" can be attributed to William Arthur Ward, not William Shakespeare. This attribution to a different author suggests that the claim has been misattributed or falsely associated with Shakespeare.", "Inconsistencies in style": "The expert pointed out that the style of the quote, particularly the more inspirational and maxim-like nature of the text, aligns more with William Arthur Ward's writing style than with Shakespeare's more florid prose. This inconsistency in style further casts doubt on the claim's authenticity."}
