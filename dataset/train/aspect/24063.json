{"The expert": "s verdict cites an interview with President Barack Obama in Novaya Gazeta, a Russian newspaper, where he stated that oil imports were partly to blame for the economic crisis. This interview serves as evidence to verify the authenticity of the claim.", "FactCheck": "org, a reliable source, pointed out that crude oil and petroleum imports have actually declined in recent years after peaking in 2005 and 2006. The expert mentions that FactCheck.org cites the Energy Information Administration (EIA) as a source to support this decline in imports.", "A March 2009 report from the EIA predicts a decrease of about 20 percent in imported oil over the next two decades": "This report further supports the notion that oil imports are not at their highest levels as claimed.", "The American Petroleum Institute": "API), a trade group representing oil and natural gas companies, stated that imports have fallen to their lowest levels in three years. Ron Planting, an economist with the API, attributes this decline to factors such as decreased consumption due to high gas prices and the recession. The API's statement provides additional evidence contradicting the claim made by President Obama."}
