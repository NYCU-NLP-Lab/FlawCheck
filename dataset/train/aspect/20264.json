{"Comparison to other popular television shows": "The expert compares the claim to the common understanding that actors in hit shows like \"Friends,\" \"Seinfeld,\" and \"The Big Bang Theory\" received substantial financial benefits from residuals and royalties. This comparison helps establish the context for evaluating the authenticity of the claim.", "Historical context of television industry": "The expert explains that actors from older television shows did not typically receive residuals or royalties. They were paid salaries and may have received additional payments for initial airings, but did not benefit from syndication or home video sales. This historical context further supports the claim's improbability.", "Testimony from another actress": "The expert cites Eve Plumb, who played Jan Brady on \"The Brady Bunch,\" stating that she and her castmates had not been paid for reruns of the show for many years. This testimony reinforces the notion that actors from older shows did not receive ongoing financial benefits.", "Unlikelihood of the claim": "The expert questions the credibility of the claim by highlighting its improbability. They point out that the narrative of Dawn Wells being the only cast member to receive residuals due to a contract amendment seems unlikely, given the typical practices of the industry. This skepticism adds weight to the doubt surrounding the claim's authenticity."}
