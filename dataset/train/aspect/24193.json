{"Increased temperatures from global warming can lead to faster maturation of mosquitoes": "resulting in a higher population of disease-carrying mosquitoes.", "Global warming can also increase the metabolism of mosquitoes": "causing them to bite more frequently and potentially spread diseases more rapidly.", "The Zika virus incubates faster in mosquitoes in warmer temperatures": "which can contribute to the quicker spread of the disease.", "Research suggests that global warming could expand the habitat range of mosquitoes": "allowing them to thrive in regions that were previously too cool for them, potentially exposing millions more people to mosquito-borne diseases."}
