{"The Facebook post wrongly attributes the quote to Hillary Clinton": "2. Other websites, such as Infowars and AZ Quotes, have reported on a similar quote but identified someone else, not Clinton, as the speaker.", "The quote has previously been attributed to Eric Pianka": "an evolutionary ecologist, but his essay does not include the statement claimed.", "Clinton has addressed population growth before": "but her statements were about smaller families and slower population growth being created by choice and opportunity, not advocating for reducing human populations quickly."}
