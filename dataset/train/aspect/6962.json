{"The claim is based on a statement made by Soglin during a news conference": "where he asserted that if there is a firearm available, it is 17 times more likely to be used either for suicide or for assaulting a friend, relative, or acquaintance than it is to be used in fending off an intruder.", "Soglin referenced a January 2016 article in The Trace": "a nonprofit news organization focused on gun issues, titled \"A gun as a defense against terrorists? The stats say it\u2019s more likely to harm your family.\" The article highlights the increased risk of suicide and homicide associated with household gun ownership. It also mentions a study conducted by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 1992, which found that death was 12 times more likely if assaults involved a firearm.", "The article from The Trace does not explicitly state that guns are 17 times more likely to be used for suicide or assault than for self": "defense. However, Soglin arrived at this number by combining the increased risks mentioned in the article - three times the risk for suicide, two times the risk for homicide, and 12 times more likely for a family and intimate assault to escalate to homicide.", "It is important to note that the studies mentioned in the article compare the risk of gun ownership to non": "ownership, rather than directly comparing the use of a gun for self-defense with the risk of homicide or suicide. Therefore, the claim made by Soglin does not provide a direct comparison between self-defense and the risk of harm."}
