This supports the claim that ISIS is considered too extreme by al-Qaida.", "Positioning as an alternative to al": "Qaida: The expert states that the Islamic State has positioned itself as a more appealing alternative to al-Qaida for potential jihadists. This suggests that there are significant differences between the two groups, indicating that ISIS is indeed considered more extreme by al-Qaida.", "Differences in fundamentalism and brutality": "The expert highlights that while the Islamic State enforces Sharia law in a traditional and draconian manner, al-Qaida has not had the opportunity to do the same.
