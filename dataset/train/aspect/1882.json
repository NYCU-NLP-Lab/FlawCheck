{"The claim was based on a post that circulated on social media platforms": "including YouTube, Twitter, and Instagram, with a significant number of views and shares.", "The authenticity of the claim was verified by analyzing the context in which Kamala Harris made the remark": "It was found that she made the comment during a speech in 2014 while discussing a program aimed at reducing recidivism among young, non-violent offenders. The remark was intended to highlight the difference in treatment between young adults in the criminal justice system and other parts of society.", "Harris has repeatedly promoted the": "Back on Track\" program as a way to provide second chances and redemption for young offenders. This aligns with the context of her remark and further supports the authenticity of the claim.", "The timing of the claim is noteworthy": "as it emerged shortly after Joe Biden announced Harris as his running mate, drawing attention to her record and making her a target for disinformation. This suggests a potential motive for spreading false or misleading information about her."}
