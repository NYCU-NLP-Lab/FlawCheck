{"Ben Carson": "s statement on C-SPAN: Ben Carson credited Thomas Jefferson with helping craft the Constitution during a Nov. 22 interview on C-SPAN. This is the initial claim made by Carson that is being examined for authenticity.", "Thomas Jefferson": "s absence during the Constitutional Convention: Jefferson was in Paris serving as minister to France for the Confederation Congress during the late spring and summer of 1787 when the Constitutional Convention took place in Philadelphia. This historical fact raises doubts about Jefferson's direct involvement in the crafting of the Constitution.", "Carson": "s acknowledgement of Jefferson's absence in his book: Although Carson did not mention Jefferson's absence in the C-SPAN interview, he did note it in his recently published book \"A More Perfect Union.\" This acknowledgment suggests that Carson was aware of Jefferson's absence but still made the claim about his role in crafting the Constitution.", "Disagreement from Jefferson historians": "Four Jefferson historians were contacted, and they all disagreed with Carson's statement and evidence. They stated that Jefferson had no knowledge or influence over the secret proceedings at the Constitutional Convention and did not play a role in crafting the Constitution. Their expertise and consensus contradict Carson's claim."}
