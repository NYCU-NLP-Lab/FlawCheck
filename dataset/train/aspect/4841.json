{"The claim was verified by examining the flier that was distributed at the Fayette County Commission workshop": "where an Atlanta Regional Commission planner spoke about the transportation special local option sales tax (T-SPLOST). The flier stated that the tax would last \"a minimum\" of 10 years with additional renewals authorized.", "The expert also analyzed the Georgia Statute 48": "8-245 (b)2, which was cited as the source of information on the tax's expiration or lack thereof. The statute was part of Georgia's Transportation Investment Act of 2010, which created a process for voters to decide on raising taxes for transportation infrastructure upgrades.", "The expert compared the information provided in the flier and the Georgia statute with the actual wording of the law": "Upon examination, it was found that the law did not support the claim made in the flier regarding the tax's duration.", "The expert considered the context and background of similar transportation fees in metro Atlanta": "They mentioned the toll to finance the building of Ga. 400, which was initially set to expire in 2010 but was extended for 10 more years by the State Road and Tollway Authority Board. This example highlighted the importance of verifying the claim's accuracy and the potential implications of a tax that does not expire."}
