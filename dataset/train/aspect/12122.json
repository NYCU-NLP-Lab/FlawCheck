{"The claim is specific and detailed": "The expert notes that fake warnings on social media are usually vague and incomplete, but this claim stands out because it provides specific details about gangs throwing eggs at windshields and instructing people not to use their windshield wipers.", "Lack of credible sources": "The expert mentions that despite the claim being widely shared on social media, there are no law enforcement or media reports to support the incidents described in the United States. This lack of credible sources raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Historical origins of the claim": "The expert highlights that this warning about eggs being thrown at windshields started as an email chain in 2009 and has since been circulating with variations in different locations around the world. This historical background suggests that the claim may be a long-standing hoax.", "Contradictory real": "world incident: The expert mentions a real-world incident that occurred in east Delhi, India, where a journalist was shot after eggs were thrown at her windshield. However, the incident diverges from the steps detailed in the viral warning, as the journalist was not harmed after pulling over to wipe the eggs off. This contradiction casts further doubt on the claim's authenticity."}
