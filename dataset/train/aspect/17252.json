{"Governor Kasich": "s statement: The expert's verdict mentions that Governor Kasich made remarks about Ohio Turnpike toll collectors earning $66,000 a year to collect tolls that machines could do. This statement serves as the basis for verifying the claim's authenticity.", "Confirmation by Kasich": "s staff: The expert's verdict states that Governor Kasich's staff confirmed that columnist George F. Will accurately recounted the governor's remark. This confirmation adds credibility to the claim.", "Agreement with the Teamsters Union": "The expert's verdict mentions that the Teamsters Union Local 0436, representing toll collectors, recently agreed to a new three-year deal with the Ohio Turnpike Commission. This agreement freezes the toll collectors' hourly pay at a lower rate, contradicting the claim of $66,000 per year.", "Overtime pay and salary data": "The expert's verdict provides information from the Ohio Turnpike Commission's 2010 ending year salaries, showing that some toll collectors earned more than $66,000 a year due to overtime work. However, the median pay for collectors was around $52,000, and only a small percentage earned over $60,000 in base and overtime pay. This data helps evaluate the accuracy of the claim."}
