{"The expert": "s verdict mentions U.S. Rep. Trey Radel's conviction for cocaine possession in Washington, which confirms the claim that he was involved in a drug-related offense.", "Lee County Sheriff Mike Scott": "s statement on Facebook is included, where he states that Radel does not qualify to drive a Lee County school bus. This supports the claim that Radel lacks the necessary qualifications for the job.", "The response from the Lee County school district": "s director of professional standards and equity is provided, stating that individuals with a recent misdemeanor drug charge or felony drug charge less than 10 years old, as well as those currently on probation, are ineligible for employment as a school bus driver. This reinforces the claim that Radel's conviction would disqualify him from being a bus driver.", "The spokespersons from other Florida school districts": "such as Miami-Dade County, Broward, and Pasco, are contacted to inquire about their policies regarding drug convictions for school bus driver candidates. Their responses indicate that a recent cocaine possession conviction would likely disqualify someone from being hired as a bus driver. This further supports the claim that Radel's conviction would make him ineligible for the position."}
