{"Lack of solid evidence": "The expert points out that there is a lack of solid evidence to support the claim that the button featuring a Confederate flag motif was distributed during the 1992 Clinton-Gore presidential campaign. This suggests that there is no concrete proof of its authenticity.", "Absence of official endorsement": "The expert highlights that a longtime aide to former President Bill Clinton stated that the button was not an official campaign item. This undermines the claim's authenticity as it suggests that the button was not authorized or endorsed by the Clinton national campaign.", "Union": "made indicator: The expert notes that every campaign material during the 1992 Clinton-Gore campaign had to be made in the United States by union workers, and the absence of a union \"bug\" on the button suggests that it was not produced by the campaign. This further questions the claim's authenticity.", "Potential profit motive": "The expert suggests that the buttons featuring similar designs, including the one in question, were likely made by someone unaffiliated with the campaign looking to make money. This implies that the button may have been privately made and not officially distributed by the Clinton-Gore campaign."}
