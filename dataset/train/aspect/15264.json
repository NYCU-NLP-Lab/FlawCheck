{"Lack of scientific evidence": "Health experts have consistently stated that there is no scientific evidence to support the claim that injecting ultraviolet light into the body can kill viruses like the novel coronavirus. This lack of evidence undermines the authenticity of the claim.", "Debunking by health experts": "Multiple health experts have debunked President Donald Trump's idea of using sunlight or ultraviolet radiation to treat COVID-19 patients. Their expertise and knowledge in the field further question the authenticity of the claim.", "Inaccurate central claim": "The central claim of the Facebook post, which suggests that health care providers administer UV light into patients' bodies to kill bacteria and viruses, is inaccurate. Experts have clarified that UV light is not directly administered into patients' bodies, and there is no scientific evidence to support its effectiveness in killing bacteria or viruses.", "Alternative medicine treatment": "The treatment mentioned in the Facebook post, ultraviolet blood irradiation (UBI), is mainly used in the alternative medicine community. However, even within this community, there is a lack of scientific evidence to support its efficacy in killing bacteria or viruses. This further undermines the credibility of the claim."}
