{"The claim is supported by a radio ad from the Wisconsin Freedom Alliance": "a conservative political group, which specifically states that state politicians can collect per diems without spending any money on meals, lodging, or travel, and that no receipts are required for them to get paid.", "The expert mentions that legislators in most states qualify for per diems": "and in many cases, they receive more than Wisconsin lawmakers can get. This suggests that per diems are a common practice among legislators and adds credibility to the claim.", "The expert provides specific information about the per diem payments received by Wisconsin Assembly members and senators in 2016": "This information includes the range of payments, the highest and lowest amounts received by individual legislators, and the total amount paid to all Assembly members and senators. These figures provide concrete evidence of the existence and extent of the per diem payments.", "The expert references the Wisconsin law governing the per diem benefit": "which states that legislators are entitled to an allowance for expenses incurred for food and lodging for each day they are in Madison on legislative business. This suggests that the per diem payments are indeed tied to spending on food and lodging, supporting the claim that legislators can receive the per diems without actually spending any money on these expenses."}
