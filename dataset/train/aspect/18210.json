{"The expert": "s verdict states that Fox News' George Will perpetuated a debunked claim that Ronald Reagan created 1 million jobs in one month. This indicates that the claim made by Will is not supported by factual evidence.", "The expert mentions that there were 23 months during Reagan": "s two terms when the economy added over 300,000 jobs, but the average monthly gain was about 250,000 jobs. This provides context and comparison to the claim made by Will.", "The fact": "checker contacted Will and his assistant for clarification regarding the specific month of job creation of 1 million that Will referred to, but did not receive a response. This highlights the lack of direct evidence or explanation from Will to support his claim.", "The Bureau of Labor Statistics": "data shows that there was a spike of 1.1 million more people getting paychecks in September 1983 compared to August 1983. However, it is revealed that this spike was primarily due to a labor dispute and the return of striking workers to their jobs, rather than organic job creation. This undermines the credibility of Will's claim."}
