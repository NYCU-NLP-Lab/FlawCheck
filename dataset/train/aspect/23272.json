{"Lack of historical evidence": "The expert found no mention of the supposed prediction prior to the events of the Notre Dame fire on April 15, 2019. This lack of historical evidence suggests that the claim may be a modern invention falsely attributed to Nostradamus.", "Invention of the quote": "The quote \"When the great cathedral glows red, so will begin the descent of man\" does not appear in Nostradamus' famous book, Les Proph\u00e9ties. The expert discovered that the quote appears to be a modern invention, further casting doubt on its authenticity.", "Genuine quatrain": "The expert did find a genuine quatrain written by Nostradamus that some claim anticipated the fire at Notre Dame. However, the expert notes that a certain leap of faith is needed to conclude that it predicted the specific event in 2019.", "Lack of connections": "The expert highlights that the connections between Nostradamus' quatrain and the fire at Notre Dame are tenuous at best. For example, the use of the word \"emotion\" by France's President Emmanuel Macron is cited as an \"astonishing\" connection, but it is not enough to definitively link the quatrain to the fire."}
