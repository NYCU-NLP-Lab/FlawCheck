Brickey provided an analysis based on a conservative annual growth rate assumption of 4 percent, estimating that sales tax revenues from a full penny tax will not reach $300 million.", "The expert considered the context in which the claim was made": "as it was used in the political campaign of Hillsborough County Commissioner Mark Sharpe, who supported the referendum. The claim was also repeated by Josh Burgin, Sharpe's opponent in the Republican primary, and was a recurring assertion from tax opponents during the primary election."}
