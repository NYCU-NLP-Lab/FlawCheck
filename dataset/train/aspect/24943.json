{"The claim is based on a report titled": "The Job Impact of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan\" from Christina Romer and Jared Bernstein, which projected that the unemployment rate would peak at just under 8 percent in 2009 with the stimulus.", "The report also included a baseline projection without the stimulus": "which showed the unemployment rate hitting about 8.5 percent in 2009 and rising to a peak of about 9 percent in 2010.", "The report itself included disclaimers stating that all estimates presented were subject to significant margins of error": "indicating that the projections were not guarantees or promises.", "The actual unemployment rate exceeded the projections from the report": "peaking at just over 10 percent in early 2010 and remaining above 9 percent, which contradicts the claim that the Obama Administration promised to keep unemployment under 8 percent with the stimulus."}
