{"The use of air": "quality monitors: The expert points out that air-quality monitors are not ideal for measuring the oxygen concentration in a mask, as they take 10 seconds on average to adjust to the air quality in an environment.", "Lack of scientific evidence": "The expert highlights that scientists say overall air quality is not generally adversely affected when healthy people wear most types of masks, contradicting the claim that wearing masks leads to dangerously low oxygen intake.", "Inaccurate use of an air": "quality monitor: The expert explains that the video's demonstration of using an air-quality monitor to measure oxygen saturation may not be a valid method, as it does not consider the constantly changing air being inhaled and exhaled while wearing a mask.", "Misinterpretation of oxygen levels": "The expert points out that the claim's reference to an oxygen level of 17.4% as \"hazardous\" is misleading, as it is above the minimum safe level of 19.5% required for work environments according to Occupational Safety and Health Administration standards."}
