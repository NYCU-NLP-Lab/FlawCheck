{"The claim is supported by the commentary of Michael Ledeen": "a conservative Iran and Iraq expert at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies and a critic of Obama's foreign policy. Ledeen claims that former Ambassador to Ukraine William Miller was sent to Iran by Obama in 2008.", "Ledeen has made this claim multiple times since at least 2013": "including in blog posts, on conservative talk radio, on Twitter, and in a phone interview with PolitiFact.", "The evidence supporting the claim is slim and ultimately insufficient": "The only source for this claim is Ledeen's account, and there is no additional corroborating evidence or documentation to verify it.", "Journalists have extensively reported on the Obama administration": "s pursuit of back-channel communications with Iran after taking office, as part of achieving the nuclear deal. However, there is no solid evidence to support the claim that such secret communication channels were sought before Obama won the 2008 election."}
