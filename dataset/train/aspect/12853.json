{"The claim is supported by a statement made by Rep": "Carlos Guillermo Smith, a Democratic state legislator in Florida, who stated that Florida is ranked 50th in the nation for mental health care funding.", "The claim is further supported by data from the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors Research Institute": "which collects annual data on expenditures by state mental health agencies. The most recent data from fiscal year 2014 showed that Florida ranked 51st out of 52 jurisdictions for total state mental health spending, with only Puerto Rico ranking lower.", "The expert also mentions that Florida": "s low ranking in mental health funding has been consistent for years, according to Ted Lutterman, senior director of the institute. This suggests that the issue is not a recent development but rather a long-standing problem.", "It is noted that the data used for the ranking is based on money spent through Florida": "s Substance Abuse and Mental Health Office and does not include services paid from other sources, such as Medicaid or local funds. This caveat highlights the possibility that the actual mental health care funding in Florida may be even lower if these additional sources of funding are taken into account."}
