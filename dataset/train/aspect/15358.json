{"The claim alleges that Lloyd Doggett": "made millions off companies like Bank of America while they took taxpayer bailout money and foreclosed on our homes.\" The first aspect employed to verify the authenticity of this claim is the examination of Doggett's personal financial statement filed in 2010, which revealed a net worth of up to $8.3 million.", "The second aspect involves checking news accounts about Bank of America and the bailout": "It is found that Bank of America did receive $45 billion in aid through the federal Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) in 2008. However, it is also noted that Bank of America announced its intention to repay the money in 2009.", "The third aspect involves a report by a special inspector general": "which indicates that American taxpayers were still owed about $133 billion from the $413.4 billion paid out in the bailout program. This aspect suggests that some companies, including Bank of America, had not fully repaid their bailout funds.", "The fourth aspect entails examining Lloyd Doggett": "s personal financial disclosure statements for 2008 and 2009. These statements, available online, reveal that Doggett had investments in Bank of America within the range of $1,001 to $15,000 during those years.
