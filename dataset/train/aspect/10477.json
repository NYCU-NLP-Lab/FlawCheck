{"Former Florida Gov": "Charlie Crist's statement: The expert's verdict highlights the statement made by Charlie Crist, a prominent critic of Gov. Rick Scott's decision not to extend early voting. Crist claims that Gov. Jeb Bush extended early voting in a similar emergency-like situation. This statement serves as a basis for further investigation into the claim's authenticity.", "Comparison with Crist": "s decision: The expert's verdict mentions that Charlie Crist, as a Republican governor in 2008, extended early voting, which irritated Republicans who believed it would benefit Obama voters. This comparison between Crist's decision and the claim about Jeb Bush's alleged extension of early voting provides a context for evaluating the claim's credibility.", "Examination of early voting laws": "The expert's verdict explains that Jeb Bush signed into law the statewide maximum of 14 days for early voting in 2004. However, the following year, a law was passed that reduced the number of hours and locations for early voting. This examination of the early voting laws during Jeb Bush's tenure helps determine the plausibility of the claim.", "The 2002 primary election": "The expert's verdict mentions the primary election in 2002, which was the first statewide election since the infamous 2000 presidential recount. The verdict implies that there were issues during this election in South Florida, but it does not explicitly state whether Jeb Bush extended early voting during this specific situation. Further investigation into the events of the 2002 primary can provide additional evidence to support or refute the claim."}
