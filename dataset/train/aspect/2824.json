{"The claim made by Keith Olbermann that middle": "class families under the Baucus plan would have \"13 percent of what they make deducted directly from their paychecks\" was accurately described by the expert as a 13 percent \"tax\" for the middle class.", "The expert found that Olbermann": "s claim was based on the caps that limit how much people would pay for health insurance under the Baucus plan. The plan caps the premiums for those who earn 133 percent to 400 percent of the poverty level, and some of these individuals would receive credits to make up the difference between the caps and the actual cost of insurance.", "The expert also verified that the Baucus plan includes an expansion of Medicaid": "making anyone who earns less than 133 percent of the poverty level eligible for the program. This aspect of the plan aligns with Olbermann's claim about providing coverage to 30 million Americans who currently do not have any.", "The expert noted that Olbermann accurately highlighted the potential financial burden on middle": "class families, stating that families earning $66,000 would have to pay $700 a month for insurance under the Baucus plan. Additionally, if these families choose not to buy insurance at that rate, they would face fines of nearly half that amount."}
