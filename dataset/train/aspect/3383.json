{"Lack of credible sources": "The expert mentions that the story of Anna Mae Dickinson cannot be traced back to the Titanic disaster or any other historic disasters. The claim is based on an unsourced 2006 article from a website called InstaPunk, which raises doubts about its authenticity.", "Fictional interview and nonexistent newspaper": "The article that introduced the story of Anna Mae Dickinson used a fictional interview with a nonexistent person published in a nonexistent newspaper. This further undermines the credibility of the claim.", "Timing and context": "The expert notes that the article about Anna Mae Dickinson was published shortly after the release of Oliver Stone's movie \"World Trade Center,\" which suggests that it may have been created to poke fun at New Yorkers' emotions surrounding the 9/11 terrorist attack. This raises questions about the motive behind the claim and its potential for being a hoax or satire.", "Lack of verifiable evidence": "Despite the detailed account of Anna Mae Dickinson's supposed experiences, there is no concrete evidence provided to support the claim. The absence of verifiable records or testimonies from reliable sources casts doubt on the authenticity of the claim."}
