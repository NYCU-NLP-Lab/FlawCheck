{"The study conducted by Christine Harris and her team at the University of California": "San Diego (UCSD) involved 36 dogs and measured their reactions when their owners behaved sweetly towards a stuffed dog.", "According to the study": "78 percent of the dogs attempted to \"push or touch\" their owners while they interacted with the stuffed doll, indicating a jealous behavior. In comparison, only 42 percent of the dogs displayed similar behavior when their owners handled an inanimate object.", "The study also found that when the dogs observed their owners reading a pop": "up book that played melodies, only 22 percent of the dogs sought attention, suggesting that their jealousy was specifically triggered by interactions with other dogs.", "The criticism of the study by Laurie Santos": "director of the Canine Cognition Center at Yale University, pointed out that the researchers did not measure the dogs' reactions to the stuffed animal or the inanimate object without their owners present. This raised concerns about whether the dogs' reactions were solely driven by fear or if they were genuinely displaying jealousy. However, Harris defended the study, stating that measuring the dogs' reactions in isolation was not the only measure of jealousy and that the study's findings still provided valuable insights into canine behavior."}
