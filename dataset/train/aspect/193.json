{"Comparison to previous recessions and recoveries": "The expert mentions that the claim encompasses more than 10 recessions and recoveries, including the post-Sept. 11 decline, the 1980 double dip recession, and the Great Depression. This comparison helps verify the authenticity of the claim.", "Reference to a news snippet": "The expert highlights a blog entry that discusses political ads using a snippet from a CBS newscast where anchor Scott Pelley states, \"This is the worst economic recovery America has ever seen.\" This reference provides additional evidence for the claim.", "Lack of consensus": "The expert notes that there is not yet a consensus on the claim, as other claims have been made regarding the recovery, such as it being the slowest in memory or the second slowest since World War II. This lack of consensus adds credibility to the claim.", "Comparison of economic indicators": "The expert mentions the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis website, which provides a tool for comparing the 10 recessions and recoveries since 1948. The tool assesses the severity of the 2007-2009 recession relative to past recessions and the speed of the current recovery. This comparison of economic indicators helps in verifying the authenticity of the claim."}
