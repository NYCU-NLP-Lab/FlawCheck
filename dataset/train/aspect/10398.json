{"The claim states that Biden reversed an executive order to reduce the cost of insulin and epinephrine": "The expert's verdict confirms that President Donald Trump signed four executive orders in July 2020 aimed at reining in prescription drug costs, one of which required federally qualified health centers to pass along any savings from discounted drug prices to medically underserved patients. This confirms that there was an executive order in place to reduce the cost of insulin and epinephrine.", "The expert": "s verdict mentions that Biden's White House chief of staff announced a regulatory freeze on the insulin and epinephrine rule until March 22, as part of the new administration's tradition to review and align unfinished policies from the prior administration. This indicates that there has been a recent action taken by the Biden administration regarding the executive order, further supporting the claim's authenticity."}
