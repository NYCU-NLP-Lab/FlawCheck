{"The claim is attributed to Rick Santorum": "who made the statement in a speech on February 29, 2012, near Knoxville, Tennessee. This provides a specific source and context for the claim.", "The claim is related to the regulation of health insurance companies by the federal government": "It specifically mentions that the government tells health insurance companies how much money they are allowed to keep of what they receive in revenues, which implies a specific policy or regulation.", "The expert mentions the term": "medical loss ratio\" as a potential explanation for the claim. The medical loss ratio is a provision of the 2010 health care reform law signed by President Obama, which requires insurance companies to spend a certain percentage of premium income on health care claims and quality improvement. This suggests that the claim may be referring to this specific regulation.", "The expert mentions that insurance companies that exceed the required limits of the medical loss ratio are required to pay the money back in rebates to their customers": "This provides additional information about the consequences of not complying with the regulation and supports the idea that there are specific rules in place regarding the amount of money insurance companies can keep."}
