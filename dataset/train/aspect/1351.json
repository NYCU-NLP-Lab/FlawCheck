{"The Facebook post referenced a specific case": "Abidor vs. Napolitano, which involved a U.S.-French dual citizen having his laptop searched and confiscated at the border. This case provided evidence of the claim about authorities being able to seize and search electronic devices without a warrant.", "The expert discovered that the concept of loose search regulations at the border is not new and dates back to the First Congress in 1789": "This historical context supports the notion of a \"Constitution exemption zone\" near the U.S. border.", "The expert explains that the exception for searches near borders is a part of the Immigration and Nationality Act": "which is not considered an exception to the Fourth Amendment as a whole, but only to the warrant requirement. This legal framework further verifies the claim's authenticity.", "The expert mentions the existence of an extended border search procedure within 100 miles of an international border": "where officials can search a person and their possessions with reasonable suspicion, a lower threshold than probable cause. This procedure aligns with the claim's assertion that there is a zone where authorities can search electronics without a warrant."}
