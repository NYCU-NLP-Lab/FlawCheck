{"Reverse image search": "The expert conducted a reverse image search on Yandex and found the same video clip uploaded in September 2020, which predates the claim of Rajputs protesting against the firecracker ban on Diwali. This suggests that the video cannot represent the recent event in question.", "Similar videos on YouTube": "The expert discovered similar videos uploaded on YouTube in March 2019 and 2018, with titles referring to the event as 'Jamrabij menar'. Menar is a village in Rajasthan known for its lake and migratory birds. This indicates that the video depicts a tradition followed during Holi in Menar village, rather than Rajputs protesting against the firecracker ban on Diwali.", "Historical tradition": "According to a report published in News18, the video captures a 400-year-old tradition called 'Barood Ki Holi' where gunshots are fired in the air. The event is held by the menariya community in Menar village, located 50 kms from Udaipur, during Holi. This historical context further supports the conclusion that the video is not related to Rajputs protesting against the firecracker ban on Diwali.", "Misrepresentation of the video": "The expert's verdict states that the video of the tradition in Menar village during Holi is being misrepresented as Rajputs protesting against the firecracker ban on Diwali. This highlights the intentional manipulation of the video's context to fit a false narrative, suggesting that the claim is not authentic."}
