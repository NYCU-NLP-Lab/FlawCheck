This statement implies that Governor Rick Scott is aware of the financial burden on Duke's customers but is still allowing the company to collect billions.", "The ad claims that Governor Rick Scott received": "500,000 in campaign contributions from Duke and its pre-merger counterpart, Progress Energy.
