{"Senator Toomey": "s voting record: The expert's verdict highlights that Toomey voted in favor of a spending bill that contained language to defund Planned Parenthood, indicating his opposition to the organization. However, the bill did not pass, and Toomey subsequently voted against the final spending deal that did not include defunding language.", "Toomey": "s public statements: The expert mentions that Toomey publicly stated that he did not believe causing a government shutdown over Planned Parenthood was a good idea. This suggests that Toomey may not have actively tried to shut down the government to eliminate funding for the organization.", "Potential government shutdown": "The expert notes that a government shutdown was a possible consequence if the spending bill containing defunding language did not pass. This implies that the claim of Toomey trying to shut down the government to eliminate Planned Parenthood funding may have been a rhetorical exaggeration.", "Expert analysis": "The expert quotes Joshua Huder, a senior fellow at Georgetown's Government Affairs Institute, who states that Toomey's vote against the continuing resolution that funded Planned Parenthood and the government could be seen as a threat to shut down the government, but it may be rhetorical. This analysis adds another layer to the verification process by considering the intent behind Toomey's vote."}
