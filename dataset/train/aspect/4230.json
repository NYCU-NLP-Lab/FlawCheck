{"The success of the": "Housing Houston's Heroes\" program: The expert mentions that Houston started its push to end homelessness among veterans in June 2012 with this program. The program aimed to house 100 homeless veterans in 100 days, indicating a specific and targeted effort to address the issue.", "Reduction in homeless population": "The expert provides data from the \"point-in-time count\" conducted in January 2012 and January 2015, showing a decrease in the overall homeless population in Houston, including a decrease in the number of homeless veterans. This suggests progress in addressing veteran homelessness in the city.", "Comparison to national statistics": "The expert mentions that in January 2015, there were an estimated 47,725 homeless veterans nationwide. While this number indicates a significant issue at the national level, it can be inferred that Houston's efforts have contributed to reducing the number of homeless veterans in the city.", "Advocacy articles and lists": "The expert refers to a list posted by U.S. Uncut, a liberal advocacy group, which named Houston as one of seven cities and states that were housing their chronically homeless veterans as of December 2015. This external validation from an advocacy group supports the claim of no homeless veterans in Houston."}
