{"The claim states that Covid": "19 vaccines alter the DNA of recipients and make people infectious. The expert's verdict provides evidence that the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, which use mRNA technology, have been authorized and distributed globally. These vaccines do not alter DNA but provide genetic instructions for the body to synthesize a viral protein, allowing the immune system to learn how to defend itself.", "The claim argues that the Canadian Covid vaccine is the only vaccine in history with mRNA technology and has never been used before in humans": "However, the expert's verdict highlights that mRNA technology has been researched since the early 1990s and has shown promising results in animal models for various infectious diseases.", "The claim suggests that the mRNA vaccines have not passed animal trials and have killed all the animals": "The expert's verdict counters this by stating that the mRNA vaccines have undergone extensive animal testing, indicating their safety and efficacy.", "The claim implies that the mRNA vaccines are not considered vaccines because they introduce a": "blueprint\" of the spike protein instead of a weakened or deactivated virus. The expert's verdict clarifies that while the mRNA vaccines differ from traditional vaccines in their approach, they still stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies and are recognized as vaccines."}
