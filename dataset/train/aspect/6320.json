{"Lack of official sources": "The expert's verdict highlights that none of the numbers cited in the image tweeted by Donald Trump are supported by official sources. This lack of credible and verifiable data raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Inaccurate statistics": "The expert points out that the figures provided in the image regarding black-on-white homicides and white-on-white homicides are wildly inaccurate. This further undermines the credibility of the claim and suggests that it is not based on reliable information.", "Unreliable data on police": "related deaths: The expert mentions that official counts of deaths caused by law enforcement officers are known to be incomplete. The data from the U.S. Justice Department's Bureau of Justice Statistics and The Washington Post's database of police shootings in 2015 present different figures, indicating the lack of consistency and reliability in determining the racial breakdown of killings by police.", "Contradictory ratios": "The expert compares the ratios of white deaths to black deaths in different sources. While Trump's tweet claims a ratio of 4-to-1 for white deaths to black deaths caused by police, The Washington Post data shows a slightly less than 2-to-1 ratio. Additionally, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention violent death database shows a ratio of about 1.5 white deaths for each black death in the period 2009 to 2013. These contradictory ratios further raise doubts about the accuracy of the claim."}
