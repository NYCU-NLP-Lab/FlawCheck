{"The claim is based on a National Journal investigation from 2015 that analyzed seven types of gun control laws": "including handgun permits, background checks, registries, \"stand your ground\" laws, concealed carry permits, open carry permits, and gun purchase waiting periods. The investigation concluded that states with more restrictive laws in these categories tend to have fewer annual gun deaths.", "The claim is supported by a chart provided by National Journal": "which shows the states with the fewest and most gun deaths per 100,000 people in comparison to each state's gun laws. The chart indicates that states with more restrictive laws have lower gun death rates.", "The claim is corroborated by an academic study published by the American Medical Association in 2013": "which found that a higher number of firearm laws in a state was associated with a lower rate of firearm fatalities.", "The expert acknowledges that there are limitations to this kind of research": "as it does not establish a cause-and-effect relationship between gun laws and gun deaths. Other factors such as education level, marital stability, and rural or urban demographics could also contribute to the variation in gun death rates among states. However, despite these limitations, the expert agrees that the claim made by President Obama is true."}
