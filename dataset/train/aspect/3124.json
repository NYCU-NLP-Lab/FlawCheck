{"The claim originated from a report in the magazine New Scientist titled": "We may have spotted a parallel universe going backwards in time.\" This article outlines the research conducted at the Antarctic Impulsive Transient Antenna (ANITA) and the abnormal detection of neutrinos.", "Memes and banter spread on social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook": "with users expressing excitement and disbelief about NASA discovering evidence of a parallel universe with opposite laws of physics and backward-running time.", "The New Scientist article clarifies that the conclusions drawn by other outlets from the headline are inaccurate": "It emphasizes that the research at ANITA has led to debates among physicists, challenging the Standard Model of particle physics and potentially having radical implications for the field.", "The authenticity of the claim was further verified by the fact that ANITA": "where the research was conducted, is a radio research site funded through grants from various government agencies, including NASA. However, not all the researchers involved in the study were affiliated with NASA."}
