{"Lack of corroborating evidence": "The expert found no corroboration for the claim in local El Paso news media or law enforcement statements, indicating a lack of evidence to support the authenticity of the claim.", "Inaccurate photograph": "The photograph captioned as showing \"FBI spokesman Darrell Johnson\" was actually a picture of Emmerson Buie Jr., special agent in charge of the FBI's El Paso division, speaking at a press conference in November 2017. This discrepancy raises doubts about the credibility of the claim.", "Previous mugshot": "The mugshot of the elderly man shown in the article appeared in a 2011 blog post, suggesting that it did not relate to a December 2018 arrest. This inconsistency casts doubt on the authenticity of the claim.", "Source credibility": "The World News Daily Report (WNDR) website, which published the article, is known for producing \"junk news\" and features a disclaimer stating that its articles are fictional and satirical. This lack of credibility of the source raises questions about the authenticity of the claim."}
