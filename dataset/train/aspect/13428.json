{"The image circulating on social media claiming to be an official": "Bernie Sanders Forever Stamp\" was not an actual stamp issued by the United States Postal Service. It was created by a self-styled \"monthly journal of progressive cartoons\" called The Comic News.", "The image was a portion of an envelope": "designed to look like a forever stamp, with the deception of incorporating a USPS Forever Stamp (a flag) into the design printed in the upper-right corner of the envelope. When the Forever Stamp is affixed in its designated place, the Bernie Sanders 'stamp' image is completed.", "The ready": "for-mailing envelope featured in the image comes with a \"Red, White, and Blue\" Forever Stamp and requires no additional postage to be mailed first class within the United States.", "The Comic News has a history of issuing stamp": "ready envelopes with a political theme, including ones featuring Reagan and Nixon. The founder and publisher, Thom Zajac, confirmed this information."}
