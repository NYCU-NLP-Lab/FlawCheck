{"The claim is based on a specific bill": "HB 7189 - that was considered during the 2007 legislative session about Florida KidCare, a program for federal and state subsidized health care programs for children.", "The bill aimed to expand access to health care coverage for children and made administrative tweaks to ease the application process": "3. The bill would have expanded premium assistance to two types of children if the Legislature appropriated money for them: children of state employees and \"noncitizens\" or \"not qualified aliens.\"", "The inclusion of": "noncitizens\" and \"not qualified aliens\" in the bill is being wrongly interpreted as referring to \"illegal immigrants\" when, in fact, it commonly refers to other noncitizens who are lawfully present in the U.S."}
