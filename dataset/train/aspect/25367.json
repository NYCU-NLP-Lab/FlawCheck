{"The use of disputed NRA statistics": "The expert highlights that Fred Thompson's commentary on the claim is based on statistics provided by the National Rifle Association (NRA), which are disputed and not universally accepted as accurate.", "Difficulty in calculating gun ownership rates": "The expert points out that estimating gun ownership rates is extremely challenging. The NRA used outdated federal estimates and made assumptions based on gun purchase figures, but there is no national gun registry to accurately determine the growth of gun ownership.", "Increase in violent crime rates": "While the claim states that we live in a time of historically low violent crime rates, the expert counters this by mentioning that the FBI reports an increase in the estimated rate of violent crime in 2005 and 2006. This challenges the notion of historically low crime rates.", "Lack of definitive evidence on the causal connection between firearms and violence": "The expert cites the neutral Congressional Research Service, which declared in 2005 that there is not enough evidence to definitively assess whether there is a causal connection between firearms and violence. This suggests that the claim's assertion of a direct relationship between high gun ownership rates and low violent crime rates may not be supported by conclusive evidence."}
