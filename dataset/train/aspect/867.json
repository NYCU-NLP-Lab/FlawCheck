{"Reports of a Walmart gift card scam": "Internet users began reporting a new scam involving a viral message that instructed people to text \"WALMART\" to 83361 to claim a free Walmart gift card. This information suggests that the claim may not be authentic.", "Involvement of bots and compromised Facebook accounts": "The scam messages on Facebook followed a formula, including a greeting, the text scam, and a smiling emoji. This pattern indicates the possible involvement of bots, and some users' Facebook accounts may have been compromised, leading to the spread of the scam.", "Use of false images to add credibility": "Many of the Facebook posts promoting the scam included photographs of food, giving the impression that recipients of the \"gift card\" were able to purchase a variety of Walmart products. However, investigation revealed that these images were taken from other sources, some dating back years, and were used to make the scam appear more legitimate.", "Confirmation from Walmart spokesperson": "A spokesperson from Walmart confirmed that the offer associated with the \"83361\" number was indeed a scam and not a legitimate promotion. This statement from an official source further reinforces the lack of authenticity in the claim."}
