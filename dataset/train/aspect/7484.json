{"Confirmation from Oprah Winfrey": "At the beginning of the interview, Oprah Winfrey explicitly stated that Meghan Markle and Prince Harry were not receiving payment for their participation. This statement from the host serves as a direct confirmation of the claim's inauthenticity.", "Statement from Meghan Markle": "When Oprah Winfrey clarified that the couple was not being paid, Meghan Markle herself confirmed this by responding, \"That is correct.\" This direct statement from Markle further verifies the claim's inauthenticity.", "Confirmation from representative and production company": "A representative for the Sussexes, as well as Harpo Productions (Oprah Winfrey's production company), confirmed separately that Meghan and Harry were not paid for their participation in the interview. These additional confirmations from official sources provide further evidence against the claim.", "Financial situation of the couple": "During the interview, Prince Harry revealed that the royal family had cut off their financial support in early 2020. This suggests that Meghan and Harry had to seek their own sources of income, such as deals with platforms like Netflix and Spotify. The fact that they needed to secure their own financial stability further supports the claim's inauthenticity."}
