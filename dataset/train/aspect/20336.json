{"Lack of evidence": "The expert points out that there is a total lack of evidence supporting the claim that the movie \"Shazaam\" starring Sinbad as a genie actually exists. This includes the absence of footage, still shots, news articles, movie reviews, and even an entry in the Internet Movie Database (IMDb).", "Digital manipulation": "The expert highlights that an image circulated on social media, supposedly from the movie, is actually a manipulated picture. The image features WWE wrestler Chavo Guerrero's body with Sinbad's face digitally added to create the illusion of the genie character.", "Sinbad": "s denial: Sinbad himself has publicly stated that he never played a genie in a movie called \"Shazaam.\" This statement from the alleged actor involved in the movie contradicts the claim and adds to the lack of authenticity.", "Alternative explanation": "The expert suggests that the false memory of Sinbad starring as a genie in a 1990s movie may have been influenced by the conflation of the comedian's name with the fictional sailor character, as well as the existence of another movie from the same era featuring Shaquille O'Neal as a genie called \"Kazaam.\" This alternative explanation provides a plausible reason for the misconception."}
