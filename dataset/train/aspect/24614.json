{"Lack of historical evidence": "The expert's verdict highlights the absence of any recorded instances or documentation of Eva Braun making the quoted statement in 1939 or at any other time. This lack of historical evidence raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Satirical nature": "The expert points out that the quote attributed to Eva Braun appears to be satire, as it was invented in response to Melania Trump's statement. The use of satire suggests that the quote was not intended to be taken seriously and further questions its validity.", "Inconsistency with Braun": "s worldview: The expert emphasizes that the quote does not align with Eva Braun's known loyalty to Adolf Hitler and her active participation in Nazi propaganda. Braun was portrayed as a supporter of Hitler's ideology and actively contributed to his image as a family man. The claim contradicts this established narrative, casting doubt on its authenticity.", "Lack of knowledge about the Holocaust": "The expert mentions that while it cannot be verified whether Eva Braun knew about the Holocaust, her close association with Hitler and her adherence to his worldview suggest that she may not have been opposed to the Nazi state. This raises questions about the claim's accuracy, as it attributes a statement condemning the separation of children to someone potentially aligned with the Nazi regime's actions."}
