{"The expert": "s verdict states that there is nothing about Romney's impeachment vote that would make him subject to removal from office. This suggests that the claim is not based on accurate information.", "The expert mentions that a proposed bill in Utah would allow voters to remove their U": "S. senators from office if enough people signed a petition. However, it is noted that this bill has not become law yet and is still under consideration.", "The expert points out that even if the bill did pass": "it would likely be challenged because the U.S. Constitution does not provide for the recall of federally elected officials. This further supports the idea that the claim of Romney being removed from office solely based on his vote is not valid.", "The expert also highlights that Romney": "s vote to convict President Trump in the impeachment trial was significant as it marked the first time in U.S. history that a senator voted to convict a president of the same party. However, this historical fact does not imply that Romney could be removed from office."}
