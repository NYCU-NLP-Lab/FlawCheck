{"The claim originated from Jack Posobiec": "the self-described special projects director of \"Citizens for Trump,\" who spread the false rumor that \"Star Wars: Rogue One\" was re-shot to add an anti-Trump scene.", "The rumor was based on a misinterpretation of two unconnected events": "scheduled reshoots on the film and controversial tweets from two of the film's writers.", "Director Gareth Edwards explained that the reshoots were a common practice in the film industry and had nothing to do with politics": "The additional work was necessary to improve the film and enhance visual effects.", "The writers of the film did make political comments on their social media accounts": "but there was no evidence to support the claim that they added an anti-Trump message during the reshoots. Disney representatives and one of the writers themselves debunked the rumor as completely untrue."}
