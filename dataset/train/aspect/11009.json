{"Multiple photographs emerged online in March 2021 showing New York Gov": "Andrew Cuomo outside his official residence in Albany, holding a bottle that appeared to be a brand of mineral water produced in New York state.", "Social media users speculated that the bottle contained beer": "but there was no clear evidence to support this claim.", "Snopes reached out to Cuomo": "s press office for clarification on the contents of the bottle but did not receive a response in time for publication.", "A closer look at the photographs and the bottle design strongly suggested that Cuomo was carrying a Saratoga brand bottle of mineral water": "rather than beer. However, due to the lack of high-definition images for a definitive identification, the authenticity of the claim remains unproven."}
