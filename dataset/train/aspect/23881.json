{"The claim that Judy Mikovits was jailed in 2021 for discovering retroviruses are transmitted through vaccines is false": "There are no credible reports or evidence to support this claim.", "Mikovits was previously arrested in 2011 on charges of theft from the laboratory where she conducted research": "not for her work on retroviruses or vaccines.", "The charges against Mikovits were eventually dropped": "as reported by reputable sources such as the New York Times, Science magazine, ABC News, and the Chicago Tribune.", "Mikovits": "s study on retroviruses, which found a presence of retrovirus XMRV in the blood of chronic fatigue sufferers, did not establish a causal link between retroviruses and vaccines. The study was discredited, and there is no reliable academic publication indicating that Mikovits made the discovery claimed in the false post."}
