{"The claim is made by a political action committee named after former Democratic U": "S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, who has been targeted GOP U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan over gun legislation.", "News reports after the Florida school shooting suggested that Paul Ryan had shown little interest in new proposals for gun control": "indicating a lack of action on strengthening gun laws.", "The Giffords PAC claimed in an online ad that Ryan has blocked all action to strengthen gun laws": "implying a deliberate obstruction of gun legislation.", "The PAC cited a dozen pieces of gun legislation that were pending since Ryan became speaker": "arguing that these bills were blocked by Ryan's ability to determine what bills come to the floor for debate and a vote. However, no evidence was provided to support this claim, and other lawmakers, such as committee chairs, also have the power to block bills."}
