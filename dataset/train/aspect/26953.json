{"Lack of data": "The expert's verdict highlights the fact that there is a lack of data available for 21 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa to analyze and determine trends in poverty. This lack of data serves as a significant aspect in verifying the authenticity of the claim.", "Inconsistent survey methodologies": "The expert mentions that surveys conducted in different countries varied in terms of their methodologies. This inconsistency in survey methods, such as sampling techniques, timing, and data collection approaches, makes it difficult to compare and draw reliable conclusions about poverty trends.", "Insufficient number of comparable surveys": "The World Bank's report mentioned by the expert states that only 27 out of 48 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa had conducted at least two comparable surveys since 1990 to track poverty. This indicates that a significant number of countries lack the necessary data points to assess poverty trends accurately.", "Verification by World Bank economists": "The expert mentions that Andrew Dabalen, a lead economist at the World Bank, supports the claim made by Morten Jerven. Dabalen and his colleagues vet the data that comes out of Africa and acknowledge the lack of comparable surveys in many countries, further validating the claim about the authenticity of the data."}
