The story about the recall of tuna fish is real, but the claim of employees cooking a man and mixing him with the tuna is false.

This flagging contributes to the verification process and helps identify false information.", "Lack of evidence in the story": "The expert's verdict emphasizes that the original news story does not mention anyone being mixed with the tuna, contrary to the claim's headline. This discrepancy further confirms the inauthenticity of the claim."}
