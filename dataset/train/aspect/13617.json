{"The claim alleges that Don Pridemore": "voted for the largest cuts to public education in our state history.\" The expert's analysis found that while Pridemore did vote for budget cuts to education, the claim exaggerates the extent of the cuts. The actual amount of cuts was $1.11 billion, significantly less than the claimed $2 billion.", "The claim also states that Pridemore voted for": "2.3 billion in tax breaks for corporations and the wealthy.\" The expert's examination confirms that Pridemore did vote for tax breaks, but it does not provide specific details on the exact amount or beneficiaries of these tax breaks.", "The expert": "s assessment also notes that the claim's calculation of the total education cuts includes the reduction of $800 million in property taxes that local school districts can levy. However, the expert argues that limiting a school district's ability to raise taxes is not equivalent to a direct budget cut. This raises questions about the accuracy of the claim's calculation and its portrayal of Pridemore's voting record."}
