{"Lack of historical evidence": "The expert notes that there is no known source or record of the claim being attributed to Cicero in his recorded letters, speeches, and works. This lack of historical evidence suggests that the claim is not authentic.", "Modern language and content": "The language and content of the claim are described as too conveniently modern to be something Cicero would have said. The expert points out that the claim uses language and concepts that are more fitting for contemporary discussions, indicating that it is likely a modern invention.", "Absence of prior attribution": "The expert mentions that there is no record of the claim being attributed to Cicero or anyone else prior to 2012. This absence of prior attribution raises doubts about the claim's authenticity and suggests that it originated more recently.", "Origin from an anonymous Internet source": "The expert states that the claim was posted to an Occupy Wall Street-related forum in 2012 by an anonymous Internet user. This anonymous source further undermines the credibility of the claim and suggests that it may have been created as a modern invention."}
