{"Austin Mayor Lee Leffingwell": "s statement: The expert's verdict mentions that Austin Mayor Lee Leffingwell made a claim in a press release that the bond proposals would not raise taxes. This statement is a key aspect that was employed to verify the authenticity of the claim.", "Unity PAC spokesman": "s explanation: The expert's verdict mentions that the spokesman for the Unity PAC, Mark Nathan, provided an explanation for Leffingwell's claim. Nathan stated that the claim was based on a December 2011 analysis presented by city staffers, which showed that issuing $385 million in bonds would not require an increase in the city's existing debt service property tax rate. This explanation is another aspect used to verify the claim.", "Presentation charts": "The expert's verdict mentions that the presentation from city staffers included charts that indicated the impact of issuing different amounts of bonds on the debt tax rate and the average homeowner's city taxes. One chart showed that issuing $385 million in bonds would keep the debt tax rate steady, while another chart indicated that homeowners would still pay $38 more in city taxes on a $200,000 home by 2016. These charts were used as evidence to verify the claim.", "Comparison to the city": "s budget: The expert's verdict mentions that Austin Mayor Lee Leffingwell voted against the approval of the city's new $3.1 billion budget, stating that the council had failed to scale back a planned property tax increase. This aspect highlights a contradiction between Leffingwell's claim of no tax increase with the proposed bond propositions and his stance on the city's budget. The comparison to the city's budget was likely used to assess the authenticity of the claim."}
