{"Lack of recording": "The expert notes that there is no known recording of the alleged racist rant by Eric Clapton, making it difficult to determine the exact wording or verbatim accuracy of the statements made.", "Eyewitness accounts": "Several eyewitnesses who were present at the concert in 1976 have provided accounts that support the claim. These accounts confirm that Clapton used racial slurs, called for the deportation of non-whites from Britain, and expressed support for Enoch Powell.", "Magazine review": "A contemporaneous review of the concert in Sounds magazine, published on August 14, 1976, describes Clapton's rant and corroborates the use of racial slurs and the expression of discriminatory views.", "Clapton": "s confirmation and later distancing: Over the years, Clapton has effectively confirmed the authenticity of the remarks attributed to him and has distanced himself from them. Prior to that, he failed to understand the offense he had caused and defended his views, including support for Enoch Powell. Clapton has also attributed his past behavior to alcohol abuse."}
