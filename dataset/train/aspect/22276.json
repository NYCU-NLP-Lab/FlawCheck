{"Ownership of the property": "The expert's verdict mentions that Holly Turner's name is not on the deed of the property in Fort Worth. It states that her husband, Chris Turner, is the sole owner of the property and the only one legally eligible to apply for and claim a homestead exemption.", "Occupancy as primary residence": "The expert's verdict states that the Turners met the state's criteria to qualify for the homestead exemption in 2009 because they occupied the property as their primary residence on January 1, 2009. This aspect verifies that the property was indeed their primary residence during that time.", "Joint checking account payment": "According to tax records, the expert's verdict mentions that the property taxes were paid from the couple's joint checking account. This aspect supports the claim that Holly Turner still takes her homestead exemption in Fort Worth, as the property taxes were paid using their shared financial resources.", "Eligibility for homestead exemption in 2010": "The expert's verdict mentions that it is too soon to determine if Chris Turner can claim a homestead exemption for the property in 2010, as the Tarrant County Appraisal District will re-evaluate its eligibility in April. This aspect indicates that the claim's authenticity for the year 2010 is yet to be determined."}
