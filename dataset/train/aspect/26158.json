{"Misreading of data": "The expert notes that Trump's claim of his approval ratings doubling among black Americans is a misreading of data from the online polling firm SurveyMonkey. The expert provides specific details about the decline in approval ratings based on weekly surveys conducted by SurveyMonkey, as well as polling from Pew Research Center and Gallup.", "Contradictory evidence": "The expert mentions that polling by reputable organizations such as Pew Research Center and Gallup show declines in Trump's approval ratings among black Americans over a similar period. This contradicts Trump's claim of improved approval ratings.", "Lack of evidence": "The expert points out that the White House did not respond to their request for evidence supporting Trump's claim of his approval among blacks doubling. The expert also states that they did not find any support for this claim themselves.", "Possible source of misinformation": "The expert highlights that Trump's tweet may have been based on a segment from the morning TV program \"Fox & Friends,\" where co-host Brian Kilmeade made a similar claim about Trump's approval ratings doubling among black Americans. However, Kilmeade did not provide a source for his statement, and it sounded similar to something reported by the conservative Breitbart website. This suggests that the claim may have originated from potentially unreliable sources."}
