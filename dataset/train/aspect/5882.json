{"The video clip in question is an old footage from March 8": "2020, taken from CBS' \"60 Minutes\" interview with Dr. Anthony Fauci.", "The clip has been taken out of context": "as it only shows Fauci stating that there is no reason for people to be walking around with masks and that masks do not provide perfect protection against the virus.", "The clip fails to include Fauci": "s statement about the importance of masks for infected individuals to prevent them from infecting others.", "Both the CDC and Dr": "Anthony Fauci have recommended the use of face masks since April to prevent the spread of COVID-19, which contradicts the claim made in the video clip."}
