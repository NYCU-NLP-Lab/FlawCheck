{"The bill signed by Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker": "known as the \"Red Flag\" bill, allows for the temporary removal of firearms from individuals deemed to pose a risk to themselves or others.", "The bill does not automatically seize weapons": "but instead requires an Extreme Risk Protection Order (ERPO) petition to be filed with a court, which must be addressed within ten days. If justified, the court can order the immediate removal of firearms for up to a year.", "Similar legislation has been enacted in other states": "including Connecticut, Indiana, California, Washington, Oregon, Florida, Vermont, Maryland, Rhode Island, New Jersey, Delaware, and Illinois, in response to mass shootings.", "The claim that Massachusetts repealed the Second Amendment of the US Constitution is false": "as no single state or governor has the power to unilaterally repeal a constitutional amendment. The Constitution can only be amended through a two-thirds vote in both the US House of Representatives and the US Senate or by a constitutional convention called for by two-thirds of US states."}
