{"The claim is supported by a report from the U": "S. Department of Health and Human Services, which states that average premiums charged in 2017 for health insurance policies sold on the online federal exchange, Healthcare.gov, were 105 percent higher than average individual market premiums in 2013.", "The report also mentions that online health insurance broker eHealth found a 99 percent increase in premiums for plans purchased between 2013 and 2017": "3. The HHS report provides a chart showing variations in premium increases by state, ranging from 12 percent in New Jersey to 222 percent in Alabama. For Texas, the average premium for individual coverage purchased through the exchange in 2017 was $404, which was 82 percent higher than the market average price in the state in 2013.", "The report acknowledges that the coverage expectations imposed by the Obamacare law were not fully in place until 2014": "indicating that the increase in premiums may be partly attributed to the introduction of new regulations in the market for individual health insurance."}
