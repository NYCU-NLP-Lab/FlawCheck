{"State legislation": "The expert's verdict mentioned State Sen. Jeff Wentworth discussing his legislation that would allow concealed handguns on college campuses. This legislation could potentially have an impact on the presence of bars and alcohol on campus.", "Alcoholic Beverage Code": "The expert's verdict referred to a section in the state's Alcoholic Beverage Code that addresses alcohol sales near schools. This code allows county commissioners or governing bodies to prohibit the sale of alcoholic beverages within a certain distance of a school, which could include colleges and universities.", "Education Code": "The Alcoholic Beverage Code also cites a section of the Education Code, which requires school districts to prohibit alcoholic beverages at school-related activities. However, it was clarified that this provision is limited to public schools through high school and does not apply to higher education.", "Texas universities": "The expert's verdict mentioned contacting Texas universities to determine if they have campus bars. The University of Texas at Austin was mentioned as having the Texas Union building, which houses the Cactus Cafe and the Underground, both licensed to serve alcohol. This suggests that at least some Texas universities may have campus bars."}
