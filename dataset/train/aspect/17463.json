{"The news reports did not provide any evidence of an actual fatwa issued by Darul Uloom Deoband against Nusrat Jahan for wearing sindoor and mangalsutra": "No copy of the fatwa was presented in any of the media reports.", "Darul Uloom Deoband clarified that they do not issue fatwas on their own": "but only in response to specific queries from individuals. This means that if there was a fatwa against Nusrat Jahan, it would have been in response to someone seeking their opinion on the matter.", "Fatwas issued by Darul Uloom Deoband are given in writing by a Mufti or religious scholar": "However, no written fatwa was provided or referenced in any of the media reports.", "The controversy surrounding Nusrat Jahan": "s alleged fatwa actually started with a statement made by a Deoband cleric, Asad Qasim, not with an official fatwa. The cleric's statement was reported by ABP News, but it is unclear if he has any authority to issue fatwas on behalf of Darul Uloom Deoband."}
