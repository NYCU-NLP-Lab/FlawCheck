{"Facebook posts as evidence": "The claim was supported by a series of Facebook posts made by different users who reported elevated lead levels in their children after wearing Walmart jelly sandals. These posts provided anecdotal evidence of a potential link between the sandals and lead exposure.", "Personal experiences shared": "The expert's verdict mentioned specific personal experiences shared by Facebook users, such as one mother whose daughter's lead levels were elevated and another mother who found lead in the jellies through a DIY lead test. These personal accounts added to the authenticity of the claim.", "Lack of official sources": "The expert noted that none of the postings or claims were backed by official sources such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Consumer Protection Agency, or Walmart itself. This absence of official confirmation raised doubts about the claim's authenticity.", "Need for caution": "The expert advised parents to be aware of products that are not made in the US and to consider the potential risks associated with them. While not directly verifying the claim, this aspect highlighted the importance of being cautious and informed about the products used by children."}
