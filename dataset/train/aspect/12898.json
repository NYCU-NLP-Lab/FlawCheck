{"Lack of evidence": "The expert's verdict states that there was no basis for the claim that the Virginia Beach shooter wore a MAGA hat and had a \"Trump 2020\" bumper sticker on his car. The Facebook user who spread this rumor did not provide any news reports or documentation to support the assertion.", "Absence of social media presence": "The shooter did not appear to have any social media presence, which makes it difficult to verify any claims about his political affiliations or beliefs.", "No manifesto or explanatory note": "The shooter did not leave any explanatory note or online manifesto, making it challenging to determine his motivations for the attack.", "Law enforcement statements": "The police chief and law enforcement officials have stated that they do not have a motive for the attack at this point and have not indicated that the shooter's politics or religion played a role in the shooting. This suggests that there is no evidence linking the shooter to any specific political affiliation."}
