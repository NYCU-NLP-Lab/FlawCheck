{"The claim made by Sally Kohn that": "white men account for 69 percent of those arrested for violent crimes\" is challenged by the expert's verdict, stating that the figure she cited is not specific to white men but includes all whites.", "The expert": "s verdict also highlights that the statistic provided by Kohn is not limited to \"violent\" crimes but includes all crimes, ranging from loitering to murder.", "While it is challenging to determine the percentage of white men arrested specifically for violent crimes": "the expert's verdict presents data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics, indicating that white men and women accounted for 60 percent of all violent crimes in 2012. However, this data does not differentiate between white men and white women.", "The exception to the limited data is for homicides": "where criminologist James Alan Fox has been able to gather information on the arrests of white and black men. According to his findings, black men are arrested more for murder than white men, even when considering population differences. However, the expert's verdict notes that firm conclusions about the number of arrests for violent crimes by white and black men cannot be drawn due to the lack of comprehensive data."}
