{"Testimony of Shehla Rashid": "Shehla Rashid herself refuted the claim of being arrested in the 2016 JNU sedition case through her tweet. She stated that she has never been arrested in her life, providing a direct contradiction to the claim.", "Media reports on the JNU sedition case": "The expert's verdict mentions that Kanhaiya Kumar, Umar Khalid, and Anirban Bhattacharya were arrested in the 2016 JNU sedition case. This information is supported by media reports from The Hindu and India Today, which state that these individuals were charge-sheeted and faced charges related to sedition, criminal conspiracy, and other offenses.", "Lack of evidence against Shehla Rashid": "The charge sheet filed by the Delhi police, as reported by The Hindu, includes the names of Kanhaiya Kumar, Umar Khalid, Anirban Bhattacharya, and Shehla Rashid. However, the report mentions that due to lack of sufficient evidence against them, these names were listed separately in a different column of the charge sheet. This suggests that Shehla Rashid was not directly implicated in the case.", "Personal statement of Shehla Rashid": "Shehla Rashid, in her statement to Alt News, emphasized that she has never been arrested in her life. As a student leader, she acknowledged being detained by the police on multiple occasions during protests, but she specifically denied being arrested in the 2016 JNU sedition case. Her personal statement adds weight to the authenticity of her claim."}
