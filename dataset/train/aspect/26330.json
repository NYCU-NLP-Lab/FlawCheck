{"The social media user": "s claim of a reprisal attack at the MTN office in Apapa, Lagos, was contradicted by a spokesperson for MTN Nigeria, who stated that there was no fire or reprisal attack at their Apapa office.", "Reverse image searches were conducted to determine the origin and date of the photos shared on social media": "but no conclusive results were found.", "Comments underneath the tweet suggested that the photos were old": "with some commenters stating that they were taken in 2012 or 2015. However, Google image searches for those years did not provide any useful leads.", "Further investigation led to a post on the Nairaland Forum message board from 2015": "where a writer described a crowd gathering at an MTN branch in Ilorin, Nigeria, after it caught fire. This suggests that the photos shared on social media were not related to the claimed reprisal attack in Apapa, Lagos."}
