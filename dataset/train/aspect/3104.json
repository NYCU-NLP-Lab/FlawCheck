{"Ryan": "s claim is based on non-defense discretionary spending: The expert's analysis reveals that Ryan's claim specifically refers to non-defense discretionary spending, which includes areas such as education, health, and housing. This distinction is important because it excludes mandatory expenditures like Social Security and Medicare entitlements.", "Discrepancy in the percentage increase": "The expert points out that while Ryan and his colleagues claim an 84 percent increase in discretionary spending, the actual increase is 24 percent. This discrepancy raises questions about the accuracy of Ryan's statement and suggests that someone's math may be incorrect.", "Inclusion of the stimulus package": "Ryan's calculations include the discretionary spending portion of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, also known as the economic stimulus package. This additional funding significantly inflates the total amount of discretionary spending and contributes to the claim of an 84 percent increase.", "Timing of the stimulus package": "One significant issue with Ryan's statement is that he includes the stimulus package in the 2010 totals, even though it was approved in February 2009. This misrepresentation of the timeline creates a distorted picture of the two-year trend under President Obama's administration and exaggerates the increase in discretionary spending."}
