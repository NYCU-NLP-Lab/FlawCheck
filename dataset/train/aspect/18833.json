{"The expert examined the original claim made in the Facebook post": "which stated that there were \"25,000 outside all to hear the POTUS speak!\" at a campaign rally in Minneapolis. The expert verified this claim by analyzing the statements made by President Trump during the rally and found that he did mention the number of people outside the venue.", "The expert assessed the accuracy of the photo accompanying the Facebook post": "They determined that the photo did not depict the Trump crowd in Minneapolis but was actually taken in Cleveland, Ohio, during a victory parade for the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2016. This finding contradicted the claim made in the Facebook post.", "The expert considered the capacity of the Target Center": "where the rally took place, and compared it to the reported number of attendees. They found that the venue can hold approximately 20,000 people, and while the exact count of attendees was difficult to determine, it was unlikely that there were 25,000 people outside as claimed in the Facebook post.", "The expert referenced the report from Minnesota Public Radio": "which stated that the president's assertion of 25,000 people left outside the venue was dubious. The report mentioned that an overflow space was not full and reporters outside the arena did not witness a crowd nearing that number. This information further discredited the claim made in the Facebook post."}
