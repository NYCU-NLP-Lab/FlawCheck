{"The claim originated from a news article published by The Portland Tribune": "which discussed a Portland Public Schools equity program focusing on diversity and its connection to student learning. The article mentioned the use of a peanut butter sandwich as an example in a lesson and raised questions about its inclusivity for students from different cultural backgrounds.", "The online response to the article": "including headlines from various sources such as Huffington Post, WTBX/FM, Daily Kos, and Breitbart, highlighted the idea that the peanut butter sandwich was being deemed racist. These sources interpreted the original article and presented it as evidence of the claim.", "The Education Action Group": "a Michigan-based organization critical of public unions, wrote an article on Breitbart based on The Portland Tribune's news article. While the Education Action Group's article did not directly confirm if the principal called the sandwich racist, it emphasized the discussion of race and white privilege in the original article as a basis for the claim.", "The communications specialist from the Education Action Group": "Ben Velderman, acknowledged that the principal did not explicitly call the sandwich racist but suggested that given the discussion of race and privilege in the original article, it would not be a stretch to assume the principal's viewpoint. Velderman's statement was considered as supporting the claim."}
