{"The expert referenced a study published in the medical journal JAMA Pediatrics that contradicted the claim made by the House Speaker": "The study followed 48 children and young adults with COVID-19 who were admitted to pediatric intensive care units in the U.S. and Canada, showing that even children without underlying medical conditions were at risk.", "The expert mentioned that Anthony Fauci": "the government's top infectious disease doctor, testified before the Senate and warned against thinking that children are completely immune to the deleterious effects of the virus. This contradicted the claim made by the House Speaker.", "The expert highlighted that House Speaker Mike Turzai declined to provide any evidence he relied on when making his claim": "suggesting a lack of substantiation for his statement.", "The expert pointed out the devastating impact of the virus on some children": "as indicated by the Rutgers University study. More than 20% of the children studied experienced failure of multiple organ systems, almost 40% required a breathing tube and ventilator, and two children had died. This evidence further challenged the claim that children without underlying medical issues were not at risk."}
