{"The discrepancy in vote counts between the two screenshots": "One aspect employed to verify the authenticity of the claim was analyzing the two screenshots that purportedly showed the vote counts for Jo Jorgensen, Joe Biden, and Donald Trump at different reporting percentages. The experts compared the numbers and found a significant decrease in Jorgensen's count, but no direct evidence that those votes were transferred to Biden.", "Lack of evidence linking Jorgensen": "s lost votes to Trump: Another aspect considered was the absence of any connection between Jorgensen's alleged lost votes and an increase in Trump's count. While Biden's count did increase by over 102,000 votes, Trump's count also increased by more than 128,000 votes. This discrepancy suggests that the claim's assertion of Jorgensen's votes being magically transferred to Biden lacks substantiation.", "Inability to verify the authenticity of the screenshots": "The experts noted that the screenshots used in the claim did not originate from Pennsylvania's official elections page. They mentioned that the images appeared to be from Google, but their authenticity could not be verified. This aspect highlights the need for reliable and credible sources when evaluating claims.", "Promotion of misinformation regarding the election": "The expert's verdict also addressed the broader context of misinformation surrounding the presidential election. They highlighted how social media posts were promoting false information about lost and found ballots, including claims about Wisconsin \"finding\" 112,000 ballots and Biden coincidentally gaining an advantage. This aspect emphasizes the prevalence of misinformation during the election period and the importance of fact-checking and critical analysis."}
