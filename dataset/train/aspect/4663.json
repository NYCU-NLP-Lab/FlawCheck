{"Closure of entry points": "One aspect that was employed to verify the authenticity of the claim was the closure of all entry points to the Hazratbal shrine, including Habak area on the outskirts of the city and the Rainawari and Sadrabal areas in the old city. This information was reported by Kashmiri journalist Peerzada Ashiq in The Hindu.", "Thin attendance of worshippers": "Another aspect was the observation of a resident who had been attending the prayers since 1990. The resident stated that it was the first time in their living memory that such a thin attendance of worshippers was observed on the occasion of Eid Milad-un-Nabi in Kashmir. This information was also reported by Peerzada Ashiq in The Hindu.", "Reports of restrictions from multiple media outlets": "Several media outlets, including PTI, reported on the restrictions imposed by the authorities. They mentioned that all roads leading to the Hazratbal Shrine were sealed as a precautionary measure to maintain law and order. Local reports also carried similar accounts of restrictions imposed to prevent large gatherings.", "Contradictory video circulated": "A section of the media circulated a video to counter the claim of restrictions. Republic TV's Aditya Raj Kaul, journalist Aarti Tikoo Singh, and Doordarshan shared the same clip which showed thousands of people gathered at the shrine. However, it is important to note that this video contradicted the reports and eyewitness accounts mentioned earlier."}
