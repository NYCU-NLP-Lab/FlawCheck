{"President Trump": "s claim of \"more than 30 million\" small businesses receiving a 40 percent cut in their tax rate has been consistently made in multiple speeches and occasions.", "The expert": "s verdict states that Trump's claim is an exaggeration, as the reduction in the top marginal rate for pass-through business income primarily benefits pass-through business owners in the highest tax brackets.", "The Republican tax framework": "which includes lowering the top tax rate for pass-through business income to 25 percent, is cited as evidence supporting Trump's claim.", "However": "the expert points out that there are nowhere near 30 million pass-through business owners in the highest tax brackets, indicating that the claim is not accurate."}
