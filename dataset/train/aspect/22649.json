This implies that they rely on verifiable information to assess claims. In the case of the Coca-Cola recipe claim, there is no mention of any verifiable information or data that supports the claim. This lack of verifiability further questions the authenticity of the claim.", "Inconsistency with known facts": "The claim states that only two people know the recipe of Coca-Cola and they are not allowed to travel on the same plane. However, there is no evidence or logical reasoning provided to support this assertion. It contradicts the known fact that Coca-Cola is a widely distributed and manufactured product, requiring the involvement of numerous individuals in its production and distribution. This inconsistency with known facts casts doubt on the authenticity of the claim.", "Lack of corroboration from credible sources": "The expert's verdict mentions that Africa Check uses credible sources to assess claims.
