{"The claim is made by President Barack Obama in a speech in 2012": "where he states that the United States has added enough new oil and gas pipeline to circle the Earth and then some.", "The claim is supported by the White House": "which points to statistics from the U.S. Department of Transportation Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration.", "The statistics provided by the DOT were last updated in April 2012 and only include pipeline mileage figures through 2010": "so they do not account for pipeline added after that period.", "The expert acknowledges that presidents have a limited role in pipeline construction": "as it is primarily driven by the oil and gas industry's willingness to invest. However, they can still verify whether the claim of adding enough pipeline is accurate."}
