{"Perception and reputation": "The claim mentions that Atlanta has long been perceived to have one of the largest LGBT populations in the South, if not the nation. This perception is based on factors such as the annual LGBT pride festival drawing an estimated 200,000 people and the presence of businesses that heavily market to the LGBT community.", "Local support for LGBT rights": "The claim is supported by the fact that an openly gay Atlanta city councilman, Alex Wan, introduced legislation declaring support for marriage equality. This suggests that there is a significant level of local support for LGBT rights within the city.", "Lack of similar resolutions in other Georgia cities": "Wan stated that he is unaware of any other Georgia cities that have passed a similar resolution supporting marriage equality. This suggests that Atlanta may be one of the first cities in Georgia to take such a stance, further supporting the claim.", "Population statistics": "The claim mentions that Atlanta has one of the highest lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender populations per capita, ranking third among major American cities. While it is not explicitly mentioned how this statistic was obtained, it is implied that it is based on information from the online library Wikipedia, specifically a chart published in 2006 in The Seattle Times."}
