{"The claim is supported by a documented quote from an article published by the Daily Beast in 2016": "The article recounts a conversation between the writer and Steve Bannon where Bannon proudly proclaimed himself as a Leninist and expressed his goal of destroying the state.", "The writer of the article": "Ronald Radosh, followed up with Bannon before publishing the information and gave him an opportunity to clarify or correct his position. Bannon responded to the writer's email but claimed to have no recollection of the conversation, indicating a lack of memory or denial of the statement.", "Despite not finding any other instances where Bannon referred to himself as a Leninist": "the search revealed multiple instances of Bannon espousing anti-establishment ideals. This suggests a consistency in his anti-establishment stance, although there was no direct mention of wanting to \"destroy the state\" in these instances.", "Another source": "the Washington Post, quoted Bannon in January 2016 as being \"virulently anti-establishment.\" While this does not directly confirm the claim, it adds to the overall picture of Bannon's anti-establishment beliefs."}
