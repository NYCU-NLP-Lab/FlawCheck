{"The expert": "s verdict states that Google frequently features a \"Doodle\" on its homepage to commemorate notable past events, holidays, anniversaries, and the lives of famous individuals. This establishes the context of the claim, which is about the presence or absence of a Google Doodle for Easter.", "The expert clarifies that Google does not traditionally create a Doodle for Easter": "but this is not due to bias against Christians. Instead, Google generally avoids creating Doodles for all religious holidays, as stated by the company itself in 2018.", "The expert addresses the specific accusation of religious bias by explaining that Google has not created an official Doodle for Ramadan either": "The graphic shared as a Ramadan Google Doodle was actually created in 2010 as part of a social media campaign, but it was never used or endorsed by Google.", "The expert provides evidence from a spokesperson for Google": "confirming that they have never created a Doodle for Ramadan and suggesting that the circulated image may be fan art. This further supports the authenticity of the claim and dismisses any notion of religious bias by Google."}
