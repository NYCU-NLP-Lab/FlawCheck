{"The claim is about Barack Obama": "robbing\" Medicare of $716 billion to pay for Obamacare. The expert's verdict clarifies that neither Obama nor his health care law literally cut a dollar amount from the Medicare program's budget. Instead, the health care law implemented changes aimed at bringing down future health care costs in the program, which amounted to $500 billion over the next 10 years.", "The spending reductions mentioned in the expert": "s verdict were mainly targeted at insurance companies and hospitals, not beneficiaries. Specifically, the law made significant reductions to Medicare Advantage, a subset of Medicare plans run by private insurers, which had been costing more than traditional Medicare. As a result, the health care law scaled back the payments to private insurers.", "Another aspect employed to verify the claim was the examination of how hospitals would be affected by the health care law": "The expert's verdict states that hospitals would be paid less if they had too many re-admissions or failed to meet certain quality measures.", "The expert": "s verdict also highlights the fact that the claim about Obama \"robbing\" Medicare of $716 billion is a relatively new one, as the oft-cited number used to be $500 billion. This aspect addresses the evolution of the claim and provides context for understanding the changes made to the Medicare program's budget."}
