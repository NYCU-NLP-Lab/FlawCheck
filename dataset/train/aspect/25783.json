{"Analysis of official data": "The expert examined the data provided by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics to verify the claim about women's unemployment rates under President Trump. They found that the unemployment rate for women was 3.7% in July 2019 and 3.6% in August 2019, with the lowest rate recorded at 3.4% in April.", "Comparison with historical data": "The expert compared the current unemployment rate for women with historical data to determine if it was the lowest in nearly 70 years. They discovered that there was a 12-month period in 1952 and 1953 when the unemployment rate for women was lower than the current rate. This comparison provided context and a historical perspective on the claim.", "Expert opinion": "The expert consulted with Brian Lego, an economist at West Virginia University, to gain insights into the labor market distortions during the Korean War in the early 1950s. Lego explained how the temporary job openings for women during that period contributed to a lower unemployment rate. This expert opinion helped evaluate the claim's accuracy and provided additional context.", "Consideration of broader factors": "The expert emphasized that the unemployment rate is influenced by various factors beyond the control of the president, such as the business cycle, technological changes, and demographic shifts. They highlighted that women's unemployment had been decreasing since 2010 when President Obama was in office, indicating that the trend predates President Trump's tenure. This analysis provided a broader perspective on the claim and its attribution to any specific president."}
