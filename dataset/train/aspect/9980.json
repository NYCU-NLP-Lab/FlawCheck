{"The first aspect employed to verify the authenticity of the claim is analyzing the data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics": "This involved examining the change in full-time and part-time employment between March 2010 and July 2013 and determining which type of employment accounted for a larger share of the increase in overall employment.", "The second aspect involved comparing the percentage of job growth in full": "time positions since the passage of the Affordable Care Act. The expert, Alan Krueger, stated that 90 percent of job growth has been in full-time positions, and this claim was checked against the available data.", "The third aspect considered the potential incentives created by the Affordable Care Act for companies to cut workers": "hours and hire more part-time workers. This aspect involved evaluating whether the law had influenced the shift towards part-time employment.", "The fourth aspect involved examining the overall trend of hiring part": "time workers versus full-time workers since the most recent recession. This aspect considered the concerns raised by economists about companies being more willing to hire part-time workers rather than full-time workers, and whether this trend had any relation to the claim made by Alan Krueger."}
