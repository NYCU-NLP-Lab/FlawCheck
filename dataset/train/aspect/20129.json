{"Multiple versions of the claim": "The expert's verdict highlights that the claim of restaurants serving human meat has been circulating online for years, but with different locations and details. This indicates a lack of consistency and raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Disreputable sources": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim originated from disreputable websites, such as news.states-tv.com, Meganews360, and CNN Channel, which published near-verbatim versions of the story. This suggests that the sources of the claim are not trustworthy and may have a history of spreading misinformation.", "BBC retraction": "The expert's verdict mentions that the BBC Swahili service had published an incorrect article about a Nigerian restaurant serving human meat. However, the BBC later retracted the story and apologized for the mistake. This retraction by a reputable news organization casts further doubt on the authenticity of the claim.", "Lack of evidence and factual errors": "The expert's verdict points out that the original article by BBC Swahili, which contributed to the spread of the rumor, was based on a combination of a genuine report about skulls found in a Nigerian hotel room and a poorly sourced tabloid story. The lack of concrete evidence, along with factual errors in the initial report, undermines the credibility of the claim."}
