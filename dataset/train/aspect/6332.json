{"Multiple news reports": "The expert's verdict mentions that Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell's office provided links to several news reports that indicated BP's involvement in the negotiations over the climate change bill. These news reports from credible sources such as The Washington Post, The Hill, and Greenwire provided evidence to support the claim.", "BP": "s favorable stance: The articles mentioned that BP, along with other companies, would ultimately endorse the climate change bill. BP CEO Tony Hayward even gave a speech indicating his encouragement for the Kerry-Lieberman effort. This suggests that BP had a favorable stance towards the bill, further supporting the claim that they had a significant influence in its writing.", "Acknowledgment by Kerry and Lieberman": "Aides to Senators John Kerry and Joe Lieberman did not dispute BP's involvement in the negotiations. They acknowledged that they worked with a diverse set of colleagues and stakeholders, including BP, in developing the discussion draft of the bill. This acknowledgment adds credibility to the claim.", "Involvement of other stakeholders": "The expert's verdict mentions that BP was involved in the negotiations along with many other parties. This indicates that BP was not the sole contributor to the bill but was one of the stakeholders involved. The involvement of multiple stakeholders strengthens the claim that BP had a significant role in the bill's drafting."}
