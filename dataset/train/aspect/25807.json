{"Quoting of John McCain": "The expert's verdict mentions that Democratic candidates and groups opposing John McCain have been quoting him as saying that the United States could be in Iraq for 1,000 years. This suggests that one aspect used to verify the claim's authenticity is the direct quotation of McCain's statement.", "Video evidence": "The expert's verdict refers to a YouTube video known as \"John He Is\" that spoofs a pro-Obama music video. The parody video includes grainy footage of McCain saying, \"I don't think Americans are concerned if we're there for a hundred years or a thousand years or 10,000 years.\" This video evidence is likely another aspect employed to verify the claim.", "Obama": "s statement: The expert's verdict mentions that during a Democratic debate, Barack Obama made a similar charge, stating, \"We are bogged down in a war that John McCain now suggests might go on for another 100 years.\" Obama's statement serves as another aspect used to verify the claim.", "McCain": "s own words: The expert's verdict includes a transcript of a town hall meeting where McCain explicitly states, \"Make it a hundred\" when asked about President Bush's talk of staying in Iraq for 50 years. McCain's own words, expressing his willingness for a long-term U.S. commitment, serve as a fourth aspect employed to verify the claim."}
