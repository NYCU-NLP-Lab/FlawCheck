{"The expert": "s verdict highlights the major problems at the redesigned job-creation agency under Mary Burke's leadership. These problems created a political headache for Gov. Scott Walker when taxpayer money given to businesses was not tracked.", "The expert mentions that Mary Burke": "as Commerce secretary under Walker's predecessor Jim Doyle, ran the predecessor agency to Walker's Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. This suggests that Burke's record at the Commerce Department is relevant to the claim.", "The expert refers to a 2007 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel investigation into Commerce Department subsidies given to businesses that promised to create jobs": "The investigation found \"major shortcomings\" in state subsidy records and that \"40% of jobs...failed to materialize.\" These quotes from the newspaper serve as evidence to verify the claim.", "The expert mentions that subsidy programs for corporations have proliferated in Wisconsin since the 1980s": "The Journal Sentinel series also found that firms receiving help rarely complied with their aid agreements, state officials eased rules for business recipients, and there was no reliable process to track success or failure. These findings further support the claim's assertion of \"major shortcomings\" and jobs not materializing."}
