{"The claim is based on an interview with Paul Ryan": "s opponent, Democrat Rob Zerban, who stated that Ryan supports \"cutting funding for veterans by 24 percent.\" This statement serves as the initial source of the claim.", "The Huffington Post article": "cited by Zerban's campaign spokesman, supports the claim by stating that Ryan's budget cuts veterans programs by 24 percent. The article refers to a previous article in The Atlantic, which in turn cites a March 2012 item in The Washington Post Wonkblog. These sources provide a chain of evidence supporting the claim.", "The Washington Post Wonkblog article acknowledges that Ryan": "s budget would spend 13 percent less on veterans over 10 years compared to Obama's budget. However, it also highlights that both budgets actually increase spending on medical, disability, housing, and other services for veterans. This aspect shows that while Ryan's budget may allocate less funds for veterans compared to Obama's budget, it does not involve an actual cut in funding.", "There are concerns that Ryan": "s long-term budget plans, aimed at reducing federal spending, could potentially lead to significant reductions in services for veterans. This aspect acknowledges the possibility of future cuts but does not directly support the claim of a 24 percent cut in funding for veterans."}
