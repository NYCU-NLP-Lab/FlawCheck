{"Comparison to historical precedents": "The expert points out that President Trump claimed that Republicans outperformed historical precedents in the House, but the data shows that the losses were fairly average or worse than average. The expert provides historical data on midterm losses for the president's party going back to the Civil War to support this claim.", "Number of retirements": "President Trump mentioned that Republicans overcame a historic number of retirements in the House. The expert acknowledges that the Republicans did have to cope with many retirements, which reached a high for Republicans in 2018. However, the expert states that this does not necessarily mean that Republicans outperformed historical precedents.", "Confirmation of net seats gained": "The expert mentions that by November 8, there were 31 net seats gained by Democrats in the 2018 midterms. The expert also notes that there were about a dozen races yet to be called, which could potentially affect the final numbers. This aspect verifies the claim by providing specific data on the seats gained by Democrats.", "Average and median loss of seats": "The expert provides information on the average and median loss of seats for the president's party in midterm elections going back to 1862. This data shows that the average loss is 38 seats and the median loss is 30 seats. The expert emphasizes that the loss of at least 31 seats in 2018 is within the average range and does not represent a dramatic overperformance, contradicting President Trump's claim."}
