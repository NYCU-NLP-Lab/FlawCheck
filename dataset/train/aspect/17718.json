{"Lack of legitimate reports": "The expert noted that there have been no legitimate reports about Fox Networks Group picking up the show after its cancellation on ABC. This lack of credible sources indicates that the claim may not be authentic.", "False attribution": "The claim falsely attributes a made-up quote to Brian Sullivan, president and chief operating officer of Fox Networks Group, welcoming Roseanne Barr to Fox. This false attribution further undermines the authenticity of the claim.", "Facebook flagging": "Facebook flagged the story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its platform. This action by Facebook suggests that the claim may not be accurate or reliable.", "Origin in satire": "The expert discovered that the claim originated from a website called Potus Press, which describes itself as an \"independent source of information\" but also includes satire in its content. The fact that the claim is rooted in satire raises doubts about its authenticity."}
