{"Lack of verifiable sources": "The expert's investigation revealed that the story originated from the Guiyang Evening News, but they were unable to locate the specific article on the newspaper's website or social media platforms. This lack of verifiable sources raised doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Inconsistencies in reporting": "Multiple news outlets, including the Daily Mail, the Sun, Metro, and Newsweek, published their own versions of the story. However, they all cited the same report from the Guiyang Evening News as their source. The expert noted that this could indicate a case of information being rehashed and not independently verified.", "Questionable source reliability": "The expert found an article attributed to the Guiyang Evening News on the website new.qq.com, which was used as a source in the English-language articles. However, the expert expressed skepticism about the authenticity of this source, as it appeared to be a news client that pulls stories from various sources rather than an official web source.", "Possible satirical or educational intent": "The expert suggested that the story may have been a humorous or denigrating anecdote aimed at emphasizing the importance of sex education and awareness. The fact that the doctor reportedly handed the couple a sex-ed handbook and guidelines before they left further supports this possibility. This aspect raises the question of whether the claim was intended to be taken literally or as a cautionary tale."}
