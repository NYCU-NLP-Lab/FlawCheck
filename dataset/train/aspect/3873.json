The event caused outrage in the Gettysburg community, and posters were shared to warn the local population.", "Suspension of associated Twitter account": "The Twitter account associated with the Left Behind USA Facebook page was permanently suspended for violating the platform's manipulation and spam policy. This suspension raises questions about the credibility and authenticity of the claim.", "Lack of permit application": "The spokesperson for the Gettysburg National Military Park stated that no group associated with the social media posts or scheduled events has applied for a permit at the park.
