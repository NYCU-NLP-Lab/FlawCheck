{"The photograph does not accurately depict a 110": "pound squirrel. The expert explains that the image utilizes forced perspective, an optical illusion technique that can make objects appear larger or smaller than they actually are.", "Forced perspective is achieved by controlling the distance and vantage point of the camera": "By positioning the hunter several feet behind the squirrel and using depth of field, the photograph creates the illusion that the squirrel is much closer to the camera lens than it actually is.", "The photographer": "Wyatt Brewer, confirmed in the comments section that he was sitting several feet behind the squirrel when the photograph was taken. This confirmation further supports the use of forced perspective in the image.", "Forced perspective has been used in various online hoaxes": "including rumors about giant frogs, rodents, and turtles. The expert references other examples of forced perspective, such as tourists pretending to hold up the Leaning Tower of Pisa, to emphasize the prevalence of this photography trick."}
