{"The claim was made by Jason Nassour on Facebook on February 18": "2016, accusing Gerald Daugherty of voting to raise his salary by 19.6 percent.", "Nassour provided a screenshot of a Travis County budget document showing the salary and benefits of the Precinct 3 commissioner for the fiscal years 2014": "2015, and the proposed budget for 2016.", "Nassour calculated the percentage increase by dividing the budgeted salary for 2015": "82,600) by the proposed salary for 2016 ($101,417), resulting in a 19.6 percent increase.", "However": "upon further investigation, it was found that the posted budget documents on the county's website listed the salary for 2015 as $90,109, not $82,600 as shown in Nassour's screenshot."}
