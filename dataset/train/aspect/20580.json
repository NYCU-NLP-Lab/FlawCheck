{"The expert fact": "checked the claim that Kay Hagan supports waivers for friends of Obama and special treatment for Congress and their staffs.", "The expert found that the claim about waivers for friends of Obama was misleading": "as the waivers were not issued based on friendship or political alliances, but rather allowed groups to apply for exemptions to keep their cheap insurance plans.", "The expert also found that the claim about special treatment for Congress was inaccurate": "as Congress is subject to the health care reform's individual mandate, although there are certain exceptions for legislators and their staffs.", "The expert noted that Health and Human Services issues the waivers": "and legislators like Hagan do not have a say in the process. Hagan's spokesperson confirmed that she has never spoken in favor of the practice."}
