{"Mike Gibbons claimed that Sen": "Sherrod Brown's policies reflect an interest in Marxism and communism due to his major in Russian studies at Yale University when Russia was still a communist country.", "The expert found that while Brown does advocate for American workers": "it does not necessarily mean he likes communism. Brown has been critical of communism, particularly in China.", "Brown": "s bachelor's degree in Russian and Eastern European studies from Yale does not indicate a fondness for communism, as many conservatives have also studied Russian or Russian studies.", "The main piece of evidence presented by Gibbons": "campaign, an article from Breitbart, did not directly link Brown to communism or Marxism, but rather criticized his alleged \"undue influence\" from the Communist Party USA."}
