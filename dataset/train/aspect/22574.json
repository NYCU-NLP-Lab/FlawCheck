{"Comparison with national plan": "The expert compared the Massachusetts health care plan (Romneycare) with the national plan (Obamacare) to determine if the claim about costs spiraling out of control was accurate. They found that the two plans were similar in many aspects.", "Analysis of health care outcomes": "The expert reviewed reports and analysis by health policy analysts to understand the outcomes of the Massachusetts health care plan. They found that while the cost of health care was still a concern in Massachusetts, it was not solely attributed to the plan itself.", "Consideration of overall cost increase": "The expert acknowledged that health care costs have been rising across the country, irrespective of the Massachusetts plan. They found little evidence to suggest that the plan caused costs to increase more in Massachusetts than in other states.", "Evaluation of individual household costs": "The expert examined the impact of the Massachusetts plan on individual households. They found that the rise in costs for individual households was primarily due to the general increase in health care costs nationwide, rather than solely attributed to the Massachusetts plan."}
