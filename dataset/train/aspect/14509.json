{"Testimony from Georgia state Rep": "Allen Peake: The expert's verdict includes statements made by Rep. Allen Peake, the primary sponsor of the legislation, who claimed that 100% of children in Colorado who were given medical marijuana for treatment of seizures experienced diminished seizure activity. This testimony is an important aspect used to verify the authenticity of the claim.", "Information from the Realm of Caring": "The expert's verdict mentions that Rep. Allen Peake received the information he used to base his claim from the Realm of Caring, a Colorado-based organization that provides care to patients using medicinal cannabis oil. This organization's data and research on the effectiveness of medical marijuana in reducing seizure activity serve as another aspect employed to verify the claim.", "Use of cannabidiol": "CBD): The expert's verdict explains that the form of medical marijuana being considered in the legislation is cannabidiol (CBD), which would be ingested rather than smoked and does not contain THC, the psychoactive component of cannabis. This distinction is important in verifying the claim as it ensures that the reported diminished seizure activity is not due to the psychoactive effects of THC but rather the therapeutic properties of CBD.", "Reference to Charlotte": "s Web: The expert's verdict mentions Charlotte's Web, a specific strain of CBD-rich cannabis oil named after a 5-year-old girl whose recovery from a rare condition was attributed to the substance. This reference serves as an additional aspect employed to verify the claim, as it provides a real-life example of the potential effectiveness of CBD in reducing seizure activity."}
