{"The origin and source of the claim": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim originated from an online advertisement placed by a website named Bon Voyaged. The ad was described as likely being years old and was spotted as recently as November 2020.", "Lack of credibility in the advertising platform": "The expert points out that Bon Voyaged used the Outbrain advertising platform to place the advertisement. However, it is mentioned that internet advertisements that lead to slideshow lists, like the one in question, are not considered credible sources of information.", "Examination of the landing page and slideshow content": "The expert states that once readers landed on Bon Voyaged, they were encouraged to click through an 80-slide slideshow to see \"Amazing Wild West Photos.\" However, none of the photos featured Evelyn Nesbit, the actress mentioned in the claim. This observation raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Historical timeline and geographical context": "The expert provides information about Evelyn Nesbit's life, including her birth year and places she lived. It is noted that Nesbit lived from 1884 (or 1885) to 1967 and spent her early years in Pennsylvania, including cities like Natrona, Pittsburgh, and Philadelphia. These cities were not considered part of the \"Wild West,\" suggesting that the claim linking Nesbit to Wild West history is likely inaccurate."}
