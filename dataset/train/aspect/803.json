{"Lack of contact information": "The website NBCNews6.com does not provide any contact information, which is unusual for a legitimate news organization. This raises suspicions about the authenticity of the claim.", "Inconsistent and misleading URL": "The website's URL, NBCNews6.com, is designed to resemble a genuine news organization's URL, NBCNews.com. This tactic is commonly used by fake news purveyors to deceive readers into thinking they are accessing credible news reports.", "Use of a mugshot unrelated to the claim": "The featured photograph in the article is a mugshot that does not depict a person arrested for carrying a bag of penises in their car. The image is sourced from mugshots.com and reportedly shows a man named Tomon Lee Johnson, who was arrested in 2011 on larceny charges. This inconsistency undermines the credibility of the claim.", "Contradictory information within the article": "The title of the article mentions \"human penises\" found in the suspect's car, but the body of the article refers to the bag being full of \"whale penises.\" This inconsistency, along with a reference to the size of whale penises, which can grow up to 10 feet, suggests that the claim is fictional rather than factual."}
