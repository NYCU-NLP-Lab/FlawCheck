{"Installation and availability": "The expert attempted to install the Kimbho app from the Google Play Store for Android but found that it had been taken down. However, it was still downloadable from the Apple app store. This aspect suggests that the availability of the app and its removal from one platform could indicate a lack of authenticity.", "App interface and branding": "Upon installing the Kimbho app, the expert observed that the application referred to 'Bolo' on multiple screens. This suggests that Kimbho may be a rebranded version of an existing app called 'Bolo Chat'. The presence of the 'Bolo Team' in the screenshots posted on the Kimbho website further supports this aspect.", "Website availability": "The Kimbho website was found to be taken down, but the expert was able to access a cached version of it through Google. The removal of the website could raise doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Messaging and marketing claims": "The messaging and marketing claims made by Baba Ramdev and the spokesperson of Patanjali were analyzed. The claim that Kimbho is a swadeshi alternative to WhatsApp, consistent with the nationalist branding of Patanjali products, was examined. This aspect suggests that the messaging and marketing claims surrounding Kimbho could be misleading and need verification."}
