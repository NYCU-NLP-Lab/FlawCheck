{"Lack of existence": "The expert's verdict states that the restaurant where the incident supposedly took place does not even exist, indicating that the claim is fabricated.", "Source credibility": "The story originated from a site called America's Last Line of Defense, which describes its content as satire meant to provoke conservatives. This undermines the credibility of the claim.", "Inconsistent details": "The claim mentions a Waffle House in \"Arnbur,\" Michigan, and a church called the \"St. Pleasant Allegorical Church of the Divine.\" However, there is no municipality called \"Arnbur\" in Michigan, and no such church is listed among tax-exempt nonprofits in the state. These inconsistencies suggest that the claim is false.", "Reposting on dubious sites": "The claim was copied by several other sites, some of which have misleading domain names or claim to share \"the truth about Islam.\" This indicates that the story was spread on unreliable platforms, further casting doubt on its authenticity."}
