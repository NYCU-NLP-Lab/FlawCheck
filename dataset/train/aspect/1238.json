{"Varying measurements and definitions": "The expert mentions that different studies use different definitions and measurements to calculate the pay gap between top executives and average workers. This variation in methodology can affect the results and make it challenging to determine an exact figure.", "AFL": "CIO analysis: The AFL-CIO conducted an analysis comparing the compensation of CEOs of S&P 500 Index to that of production and nonsupervisory workers. According to their findings, top executives received an average of $13.1 million in total compensation, while the average employee earned $37,632, resulting in a ratio of 347 to 1.", "Economic Policy Institute analysis": "The Economic Policy Institute also conducted a study on CEO compensation in 2016. They used two different measurements, one assuming stock options were cashed in and the other assuming they were granted but not cashed in. Under the first measure, the ratio was found to be 271-to-1, and under the second measure, it was 224-to-1.", "Bloomberg analysis": "Bloomberg analyzed income data from 2017 and found that CEOs made 265 times more than the income paid to average workers. While this figure is slightly lower than Kennedy's claim of 300 times, it still indicates a significant pay gap between top executives and average employees."}
