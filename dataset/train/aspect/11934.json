{"Georgia": "s state motor fuel tax data from the Federation of Tax Administrators confirms that Georgia has one of the lowest gas taxes in the nation, with Georgians paying $19.3 cents in state taxes for every gallon of gasoline.", "The comparison with neighboring states also supports the claim": "as only three of Georgia's neighboring states have lower state tax rates on gasoline: South Carolina, Florida, and Alabama.", "However": "it is important to note that the state collections do not include local sales taxes, which can increase the cost at the pump but may not always be allocated towards transportation projects. Georgia state law allows counties to levy a 1 percent special purpose local option sales tax (SPLOST) for specific projects, including transportation. The inclusion of local sales taxes can affect the overall tax burden on gasoline in Georgia.", "The expert also highlights that the perception of voters may not always align with reality": "as taxes and fees on gasoline are not always allocated towards transportation projects. This discrepancy was pointed out by Lindsey, who emphasizes that voters may assume that such taxes are used for transportation when they may not be."}
