{"The claim made by the Oath Keepers website stated that the California State Assembly bill would ban the Bible": "2. The actual bill, AB 2943, focuses on limiting programs that aim to change a person's sexual orientation and does not explicitly mention banning the sale of the Bible.", "The bill amends the state": "s consumer protection law, meaning that the prohibition would only apply when money is involved in the exchange of services related to \"sexual orientation change efforts.\"", "While opponents and supporters of the bill have debated its potential impact on Bible sales": "it is generally agreed that the bill is unlikely to immediately ban the sale of the Bible itself, but rather may have implications for the use of Bible verses in the context of selling or advertising products or services related to sexual orientation change efforts."}
