{"The image appears in numerous social media posts": "including one on Facebook that claims it was taken in Nigeria's southern Abia state. The fact that the image is being shared on multiple platforms and has been associated with a specific location suggests that it is being presented as evidence of the claim.", "The Facebook account that published the image has a history of promoting humorous content": "but many of the comments on the post suggest that online users believe the road to be in Nigeria. This indicates that there is a perception among some individuals that the image is authentic and representative of Nigerian roads.", "Similar claims on Facebook mention other parts of southern Nigeria as locations for the road": "such as Edo state. This suggests that the claim has been circulating and gaining traction in different regions of Nigeria.", "A reverse image search conducted by AFP Fact Check found that the image was published in a 2019 article about a road connecting communities in Thailand": "s Amnat Charoen province.
