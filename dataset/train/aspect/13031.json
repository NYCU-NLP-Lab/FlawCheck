{"The claim was made by Dr": "Patrick Moore, a former member of Greenpeace who has been disavowed by the organization. This raises questions about his credibility and motives for making the claim.", "The claim is based on a tweet that was shared on social media platforms": "which may not be a reliable source of information. The fact that it was shared thousands of times does not necessarily validate its accuracy.", "Experts interviewed by AFP": "including Dag Vongraven from the Norwegian Polar Institute and Robert Michaud from the Group for Research and Education on Marine Mammals, have disputed the claim. They provide evidence and data that contradict the optimistic view presented in the tweet.", "The lack of comprehensive data and knowledge about polar bear populations": "as mentioned by Vongraven, raises doubts about the accuracy of the claim. Without sufficient information from key areas where the species exists, it is difficult to make conclusive statements about their population trends."}
