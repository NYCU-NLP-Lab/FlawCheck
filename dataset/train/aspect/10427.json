{"The claim is based on articles published on multiple websites with questionable credibility": "such as AltHealthworks.com, Energytherapy.biz, Organic and Healthy.org, and AwarenessAct.com. These websites may not have a scientific or reputable background, raising doubts about the validity of the claim.", "The author of the claim incorrectly states that the study published in The Lancet": "officially declared\" fluoride as a neurotoxin. However, studies themselves do not make such declarations; governmental organizations, like the Environmental Protection Agency and the Food and Drug Administration, determine the toxicity of chemicals based on published research and other data.", "The claim refers to fluoride being classified as a neurotoxin": "one hundred percent.\" This statement shows a lack of understanding of toxicity, as toxicologists do not classify substances in terms of percentages. Toxicity is determined by exposure guidelines and reference doses, and the dose of a substance determines its toxicity.", "Even without delving into the specific Lancet Neurology paper cited in the claim": "the expert concludes that the claim is false due to the aforementioned reasons. The inclusion of the Lancet Neurology paper in the viral stories further raises doubts about the credibility of the claim."}
