This report projected that the economic stimulus plan would create 3 to 4 million jobs by the end of 2010 and included a chart predicting unemployment rates with and without the stimulus.", "The report": "s projections showed that without the stimulus, unemployment was projected to reach about 8.5 percent in 2009 and continue rising to a peak of about 9 percent in 2010.
