{"Comparison of vote totals": "The expert's verdict highlights that the claim compares the number of votes received by Biden, Trump, and Obama. It states that Biden won 81 million votes, Trump won 74 million votes, and Obama won 69 million votes in 2008.", "Comparison of county wins": "The claim also compares the number of counties won by each candidate. It states that Biden won 477 counties, Trump won 2,497 counties, and Obama won 873 counties in 2008.", "Analysis of population distribution": "The expert's verdict mentions a 2017 U.S. Census Bureau report that highlights the population distribution across counties. It states that more than half of the country's population lives in less than 5% of counties, while the remaining population is spread across the other counties. This analysis suggests that the number of counties won by a candidate may not accurately reflect the overall support they received.", "Impact of the pandemic": "The expert's verdict mentions that the images accompanying the claim fail to consider the impact of the global pandemic in 2020. This aspect suggests that the size of campaign events or the number of attendees may not be a reliable indicator of a candidate's popularity, as public gatherings were limited due to health concerns."}
