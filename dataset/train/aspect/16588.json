{"The claim is a recurring hoax": "The expert's verdict states that the claim about an 11-year-old girl shooting and killing two armed \"illegal aliens\" in Montana is a faux tale that has been debunked multiple times over the years. This establishes that the claim is not authentic and has been circulating as a hoax.", "False information on social media": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim resurfaced on Facebook on a particular page, \"Adorable Deplorables for Trump,\" and gained significant attention with over 500 comments and 1,500 shares. This aspect highlights the spread of false information on social media platforms.", "Identification of the girl in the photo": "Through a reverse-image search, it was discovered that the girl in the photo used to support the claim is actually a 14-year-old from New Jersey. This finding discredits the claim further by showing that the image is unrelated to the alleged incident.", "Lack of supporting evidence": "The expert's investigation reveals that there is no credible news coverage or additional details supporting the claim. The story only exists on websites that repeat the same information without providing any reliable sources or specific information about the incident. This aspect reinforces the lack of authenticity in the claim."}
