{"Rudy Giuliani": "s extensive travel history and interactions with world leaders were employed to verify the claim. This includes his 91 trips to 35 countries in the past five years and his meetings with Prime Minister Gordon Brown and Margaret Thatcher, as well as receiving an honorary knighthood from Queen Elizabeth II for his leadership after the Sept. 11 attacks.", "The lack of scientific polling or surveys that have specifically asked the global population about the most famous Americans was considered as evidence against the claim": "Both the Gallup World Poll and the Pew Global Attitudes Project confirmed that they have never queried such information.", "Giuliani": "s own campaign staff did not provide any evidence to support the claim, which was seen as an indication that there might not be substantial backing for it.", "An analysis of Google hits was used as an unscientific measure of celebrity and fame": "Giuliani ranked at No. 10 with 2.1 million hits, while other well-known figures like George W. Bush, Oprah, Tom Cruise, and Angelina Jolie had significantly higher numbers of hits. This data suggested that Giuliani's claim of being one of the \"four or five\" most famous Americans in the world was unlikely to be accurate."}
