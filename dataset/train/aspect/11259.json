{"Lack of evidence": "The expert notes that there is no video footage or other evidence supporting the claim of thousands of Trump supporters chanting racist messages at the Manhattan rally.", "Fake account": "The tweet making the claim was sent from the account of a fake British sports journalist, who has a history of making allegations about racist chants in mass crowds. The expert highlights the fact that the account was created by a group of friends as a parody.", "Inconsistent timing": "The timing mentioned in the tweet does not align with the actual events. The expert points out that the chant allegedly started at 7:04 p.m., while videos show that the crowd was subdued around that time. Rowntree's tweets about British soccer games also raise doubts about the accuracy of his claims.", "Alternative chants": "News reports indicate that Trump supporters at the rally were chanting different slogans, such as \"T-R-U-M-P, we will beat Hill-ar-y,\" \"U-S-A,\" and \"CNN sucks.\" The expert mentions that the chant of \"lock her up\" started around 2 a.m., which contradicts the claim made in the tweet."}
