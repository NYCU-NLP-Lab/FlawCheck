{"The expert verifies that the claim made by Senator John McCain is incorrect": "The budget deal reached by President Donald Trump with Democratic leaders does not cut the defense budget.", "The expert explains that the legislation": "known as a continuing resolution, maintains the same funding level as fiscal year 2017 for the first three months of fiscal year 2018. This means that last year's funding is temporarily frozen in place, but it is not a cut.", "The expert highlights that the size of the defense budget for fiscal year 2018 is yet to be determined as Congress has not passed a permanent funding plan": "Therefore, any claims about cuts in defense spending are premature and speculative.", "The expert addresses the discrepancy in Senator McCain": "s claim regarding a $52 billion cut. It is clarified that Senator McCain is referring to the difference between President Trump's proposed budget for fiscal year 2018 and the base defense budget for fiscal year 2017. However, this does not indicate an actual cut in spending, as Trump is proposing an increase in total defense spending."}
