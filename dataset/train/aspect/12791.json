This analysis of the recipe contradicts the claim that vanilla ice cream was originally black.", "Historical photos": "The expert refers to historical photos that show ice cream of a similar light color. While it is unclear what kind of ice cream the people in the photos are eating, the light color of the scoops suggests that black vanilla ice cream may not have been common or widespread.", "Trend of black ice cream": "The expert mentions that black ice cream was a trend a few years ago, created using activated charcoal.
