{"The claim was verified by checking the projections made by experts regarding the financial stability of Medicare and Social Security": "These projections indicated that Medicare is not expected to go bankrupt by 2017 and Social Security is not expected to bottom out by 2037.", "The claim was cross": "checked with information from FactCheck.org, a reputable fact-checking group, which had previously examined similar statements. FactCheck.org concluded that while Medicare does have financial problems, there is no indication that it will go out of business.", "The claim was supported by an op": "ed written by columnist Robert J. Samuelson, which argued that Medicare and Social Security will have to go bankrupt before lawmakers take funding problems seriously. The op-ed cited the same years (2017 and 2037) as the dates when the trust funds backing these programs are projected to run dry.", "The claim was also compared to the information provided on Herman Cain": "s campaign website, which made a similar claim and cited a May 2009 article in Newsweek as support. This further corroborated the claim but did not provide any additional evidence or projections."}
