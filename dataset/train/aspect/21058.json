{"Lack of evidence in leaked DNC emails": "The expert points out that there is no evidence in the leaked DNC emails that the Clinton campaign lobbied for weekend dates or fewer debates against Bernie Sanders. This lack of evidence undermines the claim of the Clinton campaign trying to minimize debate viewership.", "No proof of Clinton campaign involvement in debate scheduling": "The expert highlights that there is no proof that the Clinton campaign had any say over the dates of the debates between Trump and Clinton. The absence of any emails or communication suggesting the Clinton campaign's involvement weakens the claim.", "Bipartisan commission": "s role in debate scheduling: The expert mentions that a bipartisan commission released the chosen dates for the debates almost a year before Clinton and Trump secured their party nominations. This indicates that the scheduling of the debates was not influenced solely by the Clinton campaign, contradicting the claim of rigging.", "Lack of intent to harm Sanders or collusion with DNC": "The expert cites Kathleen Jamieson, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, who states that there is no evidence of intent to harm Sanders with the debates or collusion between the Clinton campaign and the DNC. This expert opinion refutes the claim that the Clinton campaign was actively working against Sanders during the debates."}
