{"Comparison of photographs": "The expert compared the two photographs shared in the claim and observed that the woman in both images was not the same. They analyzed the hairline, nose structure, wrinkles on the neck, and the location of the wound to determine that these were two different incidents.", "Reverse image search": "The expert conducted a reverse image search and found that the first image was shared on Twitter on April 25, 2020, with a caption about a Hindu woman waking up early to feed Sehri to a Muslim girl. This indicated that the image was not related to the claim being made.", "Source analysis": "The expert noted that the claim had been widely shared on social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook. They also mentioned that Alt News, an official fact-checking platform, had received several fact-check requests regarding this claim on their mobile application.", "Contextual evidence": "The expert found contextual evidence by analyzing the background of the second image. They noticed a notice written in Gujarati, which translated to \"Maintain Silence.\" Further investigation led them to a TV9 Gujarati broadcast from February 25, which reported on violence between two communities in the Khambhat area. In this broadcast, the woman from the viral image was spotted, confirming that the second image was unrelated to the claim."}
