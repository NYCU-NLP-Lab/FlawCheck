{"President Trump": "s statement: President Trump claimed that the Obama administration was begging for a meeting with Kim Jong Un, implying a strong desire on their part to engage in direct talks.", "Lack of evidence": "The expert's verdict states that the claim is not backed up by the record. The Obama administration's special representative for North Korea policy, Glyn Davies, clearly stated in a 2013 hearing that the United States would not engage in talks for the sake of talks and that they had specific conditions for dialogue. This contradicts the notion of begging for a meeting.", "Obama": "s approach: The expert highlights Obama's approach of \"strategic patience,\" which involved taking a stand-off approach and waiting for the right conditions to engage with North Korea. This contradicts the claim that Obama was actively seeking a meeting with Kim Jong Un.", "Preconditions for talks": "Obama, in his 2013 State of the Union address, emphasized that North Korea must meet its international obligations before achieving security and prosperity. This further supports the expert's verdict that Obama did not beg for a meeting and had specific conditions for dialogue."}
