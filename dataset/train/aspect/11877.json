{"The expert examined the specific tax rates mentioned in the claim and compared them to the actual tax rates implemented under Obamacare": "They found that the claim inaccurately stated the changes in tax rates, as the rates mentioned in the email did not align with the actual changes.", "The expert analyzed the timeline of when the tax rate changes took effect": "noting that they were implemented on January 1, 2013, not January 1, 2014 as stated in the claim. This discrepancy further undermines the accuracy of the claim.", "The expert pointed out that the tax rates mentioned in the claim were not exclusively passed by Democrats": "as the email suggested. They were actually part of the bipartisan American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which was passed after the 2012 presidential election to avoid the \"fiscal cliff.\" This contradicts the claim's assertion that only Democrats voted for these tax increases.", "The expert also highlighted that the claim inaccurately combined income and payroll taxes to create an inflated tax burden": "While it is not uncommon for tax experts to consider these taxes together, the claim's calculation of a combined rate of 52.2% is misleading. The actual combined rate for income and payroll taxes under Obamacare was 43.4%."}
