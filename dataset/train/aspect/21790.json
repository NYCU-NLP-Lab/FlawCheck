{"The claim is based on a press release and statements made by Republican State Assemblywoman Melissa Melendez": "who accused Governor Jerry Brown and fellow Democrats of diverting 30 percent of the funding from the gas tax increase to non-road related projects.", "The gas tax increase is part of a larger transportation funding legislation signed by Governor Brown in April 2017": "known as \"the gas tax.\" This legislation includes an initial 12 cent per gallon gas tax increase, a diesel tax hike, and a new transportation improvement fee.", "The claim is supported by a chart in Governor Brown": "s revised May budget, which shows proposals for spending $2.8 billion of the new transportation revenue in the next fiscal year. This chart reveals that $818.7 million, approximately 29 percent, would be allocated to non-road related projects such as building parks and job training for felons.", "The overall focus of the funding package is on road repair and accountability": "as indicated by the name of the legislation, \"The Road Repair and Accountability Act of 2017.\" However, the claim suggests that a significant portion of the funding is being diverted away from roads and used for other purposes."}
