{"The claim that 58": "of employees at NASA are Indian is refuted by the official data and information available on the NASA website, which states that Asian Americans or Pacific Islanders, including Indians, account for only 8% of the total workforce.", "The NASA Model Equal Employment Opportunity Agency Plan and Accomplishment Report shows that the percentage of Asian American or Pacific Islander employees has steadily increased from 4": "5% in 1996 to 7.4% in 2016. However, this percentage is still far below the claimed 58%.", "NASA": "s employment policy clearly states that US citizens are primarily hired, with exceptions being rare. This contradicts the claim that a significant proportion of NASA employees are Indian.", "The CEOs of the companies mentioned in the viral message": "such as Google, Nokia, Adobe, and Microsoft, are of Indian origin but not necessarily Indian citizens. Many of them hold American citizenship or are from different countries, undermining the claim's credibility."}
