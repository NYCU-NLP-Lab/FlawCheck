{"Lack of specific dates or time zones": "The claim lacks any specific information regarding when the dangerous cosmic rays will pass near Earth. This lack of specificity raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Repetitive and widespread nature of the warning": "The expert notes that the warning about dangerous cosmic rays passing by Earth has been circulating for over a year and is largely identical in its phrasing. This repetitive and widespread nature suggests that it may be a rumor or hoax rather than a scientifically verified claim.", "Inaccurate or imprecise scientific information": "The expert highlights the imprecise science involved in the warning. The term \"cosmic rays\" is used in a broad and inconsistent manner, including both high-energy particles from outside the solar system and particles accelerated in association with energetic events on the Sun. This lack of accurate scientific information raises doubts about the credibility of the claim.", "Monitoring by reputable scientific agencies": "The expert mentions that NASA and NOAA constantly monitor the sun for events that could eject solar particles towards Earth. However, their monitoring is primarily focused on the impact on electrical grids and devices, rather than the health risk to humans. This suggests that the claim may be exaggerated or misinterpreted, as reputable scientific agencies do not prioritize such warnings."}
