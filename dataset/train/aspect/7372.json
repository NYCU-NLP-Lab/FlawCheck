{"Comparison of youth vote percentages": "The expert compares the claim made by Senator Rand Paul that the president won the youth vote 3 to 1 with the actual data from exit polls in 2008 and 2012, showing that Obama won by a 2 to 1 ratio in 2008 and a 3 to 2 ratio in 2012. This comparison helps verify the accuracy of the claim.", "Clarification of the percentage drop": "The expert notes that Senator Paul's statement about a 20 to 30 percent drop in Obama's youth support can be interpreted in two ways - as a difference in percentage points or as a percent change. By analyzing the data from the Harvard University Institute of Politics, the expert determines that the drop in approval rating among young voters was just over 20 percent when considering it as a percentage of his support. This clarification helps verify the accuracy of the claim.", "Examination of approval ratings": "The expert looks at the approval ratings reported by Gallup and the Harvard University Institute of Politics to assess the recent trend in Obama's support among young voters. The data from these sources show a decline in approval ratings, supporting the claim made by Senator Paul about a drop in support among the youth. This examination helps verify the accuracy of the claim.", "Analysis of the context": "The expert provides additional context by mentioning Senator Paul's criticism of President Obama's inability to retain support among young voters and suggesting that Republicans could attract more of the demographic's support. This context helps understand the motivation behind the claim and adds credibility to the verification process."}
