{"Comparison with previous claims": "The expert compared the claim made by U.S. Rep. Albio Sires with the actual data provided by the College Board. They found that the claim of a 28 percent increase in college tuition over the past 10 years was inaccurate and that the actual increase was approximately 72 percent for public four-year institutions.", "Use of reliable data": "The expert relied on data from the College Board's \"Trends in College Pricing\" report, which is based on an annual survey of nearly 4,000 postsecondary institutions across the country. This data is considered reliable and provides a comprehensive overview of tuition and fee trends.", "Verification through inflation adjustment": "To ensure an accurate comparison, the expert adjusted the tuition and fee figures for inflation. This adjustment helps to account for changes in the value of money over time and provides a more accurate representation of the actual increase in college tuition.", "Clarification of timeframe": "The expert also clarified the timeframe mentioned by U.S. Rep. Albio Sires. While the claim referred to the past 10 years, the expert found that the 28 percent increase cited by the congressman was actually the increase over the past five years at public four-year institutions, according to the College Board's data. This clarification helps to provide a more precise understanding of the claim and its accuracy."}
