{"The claim is based on a real study": "The expert's verdict mentions that Obama's claim about health care premiums going up slower than any time in the last 50 years is rooted in a study conducted by economists from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. This study provides evidence to support the claim.", "Linguistic confusion between premiums and total health care spending": "The expert's verdict highlights that Obama made a mistake by using the terms \"premiums\" and \"total health care spending\" interchangeably. Premiums refer to what people pay to buy health insurance coverage, while total health care spending includes additional costs such as copays, coinsurance, deductibles, and services not covered by insurance. This linguistic confusion can lead to a misinterpretation of the claim.", "Historical comparison of health care spending growth": "The expert's verdict mentions that the study by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services showed that health care spending grew less in 2009 and 2010 than any time in the previous 51 years. This historical comparison provides context for understanding the claim about slower premium growth.", "Connection to reforms in the health care law": "The expert's verdict states that the fact-check will examine whether the slowing of premium growth is connected to reforms in Obama's health care law. This aspect suggests that the authenticity of the claim is being evaluated in relation to the impact of the health care law on premium growth."}
