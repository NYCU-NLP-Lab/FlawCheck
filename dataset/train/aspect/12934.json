{"The claim states that property insurance rates are going up because Rick Scott signed a bill preventing the state from regulating insurance": "The expert's verdict confirms that property insurance rates have indeed increased.", "The expert clarifies that the reason for the rate increase is not due to the state": "s Office of Insurance Regulation, but rather because of a law signed by Rick Scott called SB 408. This law allowed for reductions in coverage limits, shortened the window for filing certain claims, and limited claims for damage caused by sinkholes to primary structures, among other things.", "The law also required insurance companies to file requests with the Office of Insurance Regulation for rate increases related to higher reinsurance costs": "capping those requests at 15 percent per year. This contradicts the claim that the law prevents the state from regulating insurance.", "Additionally": "the law aimed to reduce the number of policies run by state-run insurer Citizens and transfer them to private companies. This was intended to make Citizens \"actuarially sound\" and reverse a trend of more property owners relying on the agency."}
