{"Testimony from Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Adm": "Mike Mullen: The expert's verdict mentions that both Gates and Mullen testified in favor of dropping the Don't Ask, Don't Tell law during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing. This testimony supports the claim that the two people appointed by the president supported the change in law.", "Statements from top officers in the Air Force": "Army, and Marine Corps: The expert's verdict mentions that these officers voiced grave concerns about ending the Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy during a time of war. Their statements imply that they did not support the change in law, which contradicts the claim that all those who do not answer directly to the president said it was a terrible idea.", "News article from The New York Times": "The expert's verdict references a New York Times article that reported on the testimony of Adm. Mike Mullen. The article states that Mullen was the first sitting chairman of the Joint Chiefs to support repealing the law and believed that allowing gays and lesbians to serve openly would be the right thing to do. This article provides additional evidence to support the claim.", "House and Senate votes": "The expert's verdict mentions that the House and Senate both voted to repeal the Don't Ask, Don't Tell law, and President Barack Obama signed the change into law. These votes and the president's signature indicate that there was enough support for the change among lawmakers to pass the legislation, which aligns with the claim that the president and his appointees supported the repeal."}
