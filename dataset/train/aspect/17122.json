{"Comparison of street population totals": "The experts examined the claim by comparing the street population totals from 2002 to 2009, two years before Gavin Newsom became mayor to two years before he left office. This comparison showed a 40 percent reduction in the street population.", "Rise in street population after Newsom": "s term: Despite the initial reduction in street population, the experts found that the street total climbed to 3,100 by 2011, which was an increase of about 400 people over Newsom's final two years as mayor.", "Impact of nonprofit homeless program closures": "The experts considered the closure of several nonprofit homeless programs, including drop-in centers, a shelter, and a treatment program, which resulted in a decrease in available services for the homeless population. This closure may have contributed to the increase in street population after Newsom's term.", "Overall homeless population stability": "While the street population experienced fluctuations, the experts noted that the city's overall homeless population remained relatively steady, hovering around 6,500 from 2009 to 2011. This indicates that the reduction in street population may not have significantly impacted the overall homelessness issue in San Francisco."}
