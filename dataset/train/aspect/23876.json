{"The expert examined the statements made by Tony Perkins": "president of the Family Research Council, regarding the welfare of children and the claim that \"children do best with a mom and a dad.\"", "The expert analyzed the Family Research Council": "s webpage, which presented 10 arguments against same-sex marriage based on social science. The focus was on identifying points that specifically addressed the welfare of children in same-sex and opposite-sex households.", "Out of the 10 arguments": "five were found to be more related to marriage and society rather than directly addressing the welfare of children. These arguments included promoting domestication of men, paternal commitment, sexual fidelity, gender-typical roles, and the association of marriage with procreation.", "The remaining four arguments on the Family Research Council": "s list were examined. One argument asserted that children need fathers and cited a study on households where the father is absent. However, this research did not specifically address children with same-sex parents. The webpage also mentioned the importance of mothers for children, but the sources cited were books rather than academic studies comparing same-sex and opposite-sex households. The final two points addressed the data on children of same-sex households, but the expert noted that the court affidavit cited by the Family Research Council was critiqued for not meeting generally accepted standards of scientific research."}
