{"Verification of apprehension figures": "The expert examined the claim made by U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz regarding the number of apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border. They compared the claim to data from U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and found that Cruz's statement was inaccurate. The actual number of apprehensions in May was 132,887, not the claimed 144,000.", "Analysis of data source": "The expert investigated the source cited by Cruz's spokesperson, an article from U.S. News and World Report titled \"Arrests at Southern Border Jumped to 144,000 in May.\" They pointed out that the article included both apprehensions and individuals deemed inadmissible at the border, which are not the same. The expert clarified that the article was incorrect in considering both categories as apprehensions.", "Examination of projected apprehensions": "The expert evaluated Cruz's statement about projected apprehensions if the May volume continued for the next 12 months. They determined that this claim was speculative and not based on any concrete evidence or analysis. The expert did not find any reliable data or projections to support Cruz's assertion.", "Assessment of border infrastructure and capacity": "The expert analyzed Cruz's statement about the overwhelming impact of the volume of illegal crossings on border infrastructure and communities. While the expert did not provide a definitive verdict on this aspect, they presented Cruz's claim without refutation, suggesting that it was difficult to determine the accuracy of this particular aspect."}
