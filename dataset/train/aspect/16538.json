{"Census figures": "The expert mentions that census figures released in September 2010 showed that Milwaukee had the fourth-highest poverty rate among the nation's big cities. This suggests that there is data available to verify the claim about the poverty level in the city.", "Interview statement": "The claim is based on a statement made by U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore in an interview with a Milwaukee weekly newspaper. The expert highlights that Moore mentioned representing the fourth-poorest congressional district in the country. This statement can be considered as evidence to support the claim.", "Spokesperson": "s explanation: Moore's spokesperson, David Frey, provided two explanations to back up Moore's statement. Initially, Frey referred to a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel article that called Milwaukee the nation's fourth-poorest city based on the census figures. Later, Frey claimed that Moore misspoke and meant to say she represents America's fourth-poorest city, not congressional district. These explanations provide additional context and reasoning behind the claim.", "Comparison with other cities": "The expert compares Milwaukee's poverty ranking among big cities and all cities covered by the census data. It is stated that Milwaukee ranked fourth among large cities but 46th in poverty among all cities. This comparison helps to clarify the accuracy of the claim and provides a broader perspective on the poverty level in Milwaukee."}
