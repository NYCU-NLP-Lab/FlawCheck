{"The announcement of the deaths": "The expert highlights that the Broward County Sheriff's Office officially announced the deaths of the two deputies, Marshall Lawrence Peterson and Jason Fitzsimons, in April 2018. This verifies the fact that the deaths did occur.", "Lack of suspiciousness by local officials": "The expert mentions that local officials did not label either man's death as \"suspicious.\" This suggests that there was no evidence or indication of foul play surrounding their deaths.", "Common factors in the deaths": "The expert notes that both deputies worked for the Broward County Sheriff's Office, were relatively young (Fitzsimons was 42, Peterson was 53), and no cause of death was announced for either case. These commonalities suggest that the deaths may have been related, but not in the way claimed by conspiracy sites.", "Suicide as a likely cause of death": "The expert suggests that the lack of stated causes of death, combined with the use of common euphemistic language, such as \"died unexpectedly\" and \"died at his residence,\" indicates that suicide is a more likely cause of death in each case. This contradicts the claim that the deaths were suspicious and linked to the Parkland shooting exposure."}
