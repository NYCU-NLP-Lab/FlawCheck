{"The Washington Post article": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim is based on a report from The Washington Post. This article provides specific details about the installation of a golf simulator in the White House and quotes unnamed White House sources.", "Lack of response from the White House": "The expert mentions that they reached out to the White House for confirmation or denial of the claim but did not receive a response. The absence of a response from the White House adds to the uncertainty surrounding the authenticity of the claim.", "Lack of confirmation from golf simulator companies": "The expert also contacted leading companies that produce golf simulators to inquire whether they had sold one to President Trump or former President Obama. None of the companies confirmed such a sale, which raises doubts about the claim.", "Absence of records in federal procurement database": "The official federal procurement database, USASpending.gov, does not contain any record of a golf simulator being purchased for use in the White House in 2018 or 2019. However, this could be because President Trump personally paid for the item or because the records for that period had not yet been published."}
