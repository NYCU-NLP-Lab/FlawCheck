{"The claim states that cuts to Medicare affect people who have already": "paid in\" and that they have paid for it. The expert's verdict acknowledges that Americans 65 and over have indeed \"paid in\" to Medicare through payroll taxes throughout their working lives.", "The expert explains that the proceeds of payroll taxes paid by workers of all ages": "combined with the proceeds of current beneficiaries' Medicare premiums, are used to cover the Medicare costs of today's beneficiaries.

The calculations take into account factors such as marital status and family income to determine the amount paid in and the amount paid out.", "The expert mentions that the Urban Institute adjusted all dollar figures at 2 percentage points above the rate of inflation to make the final amounts comparable to what might have been achieved if the tax money had been invested privately": "This adjustment allows for a more accurate assessment of the financial implications of Medicare contributions."}
