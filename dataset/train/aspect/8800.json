By finding the original photographs on these reputable platforms, they were able to confirm that the viral images were not depicting the recent turmoil between India and Pakistan.", "Analysis of image captions and accompanying text": "The expert paid attention to the captions and accompanying text shared with the viral images.

They found that some images were from incidents unrelated to the recent altercation between India and Pakistan, such as a terrorist attack in Punjab in 2015 and a military operation in Pakistan's Hangu in 2014. This helped establish that the images were not representative of the current situation."}
