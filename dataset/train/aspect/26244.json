{"The claim is supported by numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics": "which show that in December, the labor force shrunk by 347,000 while about 74,000 jobs were added.", "The aging population is a significant factor in the decline of the labor force participation rate": "with a growing number of Americans retiring earlier than they might have in a tough job market.", "The data on": "discouraged workers\" provides some clues but not a definitive answer, as it counts people who looked for a job in the past year but did not during the last month, and the reasons for not looking can vary.", "By cherry": "picking the December numbers, the claim presents a more dire statistic, as the number of discouraged workers rose by 155,000, which is higher than the number of jobs gained. However, looking at the data from other months throughout the year presents a different picture."}
