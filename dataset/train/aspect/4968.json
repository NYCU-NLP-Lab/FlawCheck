Intelligence and Z|13 Security, as its primary source, which raises doubts about the credibility of the information.", "The claim hijacked the social media hashtag": "DitchTheDevice, which has been used to encourage cell phone users to spend more time away from their tech, suggesting a potential manipulation of public sentiment.", "The source of the claim": "the Seattle Tribune, is affiliated with a known source of fake news, Associated Media Coverage, and admits to being a purveyor of fabricated information in a disclaimer.
