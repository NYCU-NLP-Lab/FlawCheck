{"Comparison of job losses": "The expert compared the claim that 700,000 jobs were being lost per month when President Obama took office with the actual data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which showed that 818,000 jobs were lost in January 2009. This comparison highlighted a discrepancy between the claim and the actual numbers.", "Duration of job growth": "The expert analyzed the claim that there had been job growth for 24 consecutive months. However, the Bureau of Labor Statistics data showed that the last time the United States lost jobs was 22 months ago, not 24. This aspect questioned the accuracy of the claim regarding the duration of job growth.", "Significance of job increases": "The expert referred to a labor economist who stated that the economy needs to create 90,000 to 100,000 jobs each month to keep pace with the number of people entering the workforce. The expert then highlighted that during 7 of the 22 months with job growth, the number of jobs created was below 100,000, suggesting that the increases may not be significant enough to meet the demand.", "Verification of the source": "The expert mentioned that they asked the campaign for the source of the statement, indicating a step taken to verify the authenticity of the claim.
