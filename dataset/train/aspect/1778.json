{"The expert mentions that the most recent polling from Gallup shows that 50 percent of Americans identify as pro": "choice, compared to 44 percent who identify as pro-life. This data provides evidence that public support for abortion is not actually going down, as the claim suggests.", "The expert also mentions that the gap between pro": "choice and pro-life positions is outside the margin of error, indicating a statistically significant edge for the pro-choice position. This further supports the idea that public support for abortion is not decreasing.", "The expert highlights that other research": "including data from Pew, shows that public opinion on abortion has remained relatively stable for more than 20 years. This suggests that there has not been a significant decline in public support for abortion.", "The expert mentions that shifts in public opinion on abortion have coincided with political events and legislation": "but the increasing percentage of Americans who identify as primarily liberal may contribute to the pro-choice group maintaining its edge. This indicates that external factors and political events can influence public opinion on abortion, but it does not necessarily mean that support is decreasing overall."}
