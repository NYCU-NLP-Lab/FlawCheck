{"The claim has been circulating on social media platforms": "particularly on Twitter and Facebook, for several years. This indicates that it has been a topic of discussion and sharing among users.", "The Government of Netherlands has a readily available list of mandatory subjects for primary education": "and the Bhagavad Gita is not mentioned as a compulsory subject/module. This official information contradicts the claim.", "Alt News": "a fact-checking organization, found articles on the internet that also stated the claim. This suggests that the misinformation has been spread through various sources.", "The photograph accompanying the claim": "showing two young girls, was reverse-searched and found to have been uploaded on a website in September 2013. This indicates that the photograph is not recent and may not be directly related to the claim."}
