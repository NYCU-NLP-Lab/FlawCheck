{"Lack of FDA approval": "The expert mentions that in the United States, only ophthalmologists are allowed to perform LASIK surgery using FDA-approved lasers. The claim of a new product for at-home laser surgery raises doubts about its authenticity as it would be dangerous and illegal without FDA approval.", "Invalidity of the website": "The expert points out several clues that indicate the website promoting the at-home laser surgery is a hoax. These clues include the absence of contact information, such as a phone number or address, and a non-functioning mechanism for ordering the product. These factors contribute to questioning the authenticity of the claim.", "Previous existence of a hoax": "The expert highlights that a similar hoax website had circulated in 2006, claiming the same breakthrough in at-home laser eye surgery. The recurrence of the hoax in 2017 further diminishes the credibility of the claim.", "Lack of training and oversight": "The expert emphasizes that home eye surgery without proper training and oversight remains dangerous, regardless of advancements in technology and medicine. This aspect highlights the potential risks involved in attempting laser surgery on one's own eyes at home, further discrediting the claim."}
