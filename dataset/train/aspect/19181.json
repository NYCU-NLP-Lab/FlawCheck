{"Testimony from state Rep": "John Torbett: The claim is supported by a tweet from state Rep. John Torbett, who introduced a bill to provide a duty-free lunch break for all teachers in North Carolina. His tweet confirms that teachers currently do not have a lunch break.", "Confirmation from the North Carolina Association of Educators": "Mark Jewell, president of the North Carolina Association of Educators, acknowledges that the state requirement for schools to create a plan for duty-free lunch breaks has no practical implementation. This statement further supports the claim that teachers in North Carolina do not currently receive a lunch break.", "Personal experiences of teachers": "Angie Scioli, a social studies teacher at Leesville Road High School, provides firsthand accounts of how lunch breaks are limited or non-existent for teachers. She explains that students often require extra help or make-up assignments during lunch periods, leaving teachers with little to no time for themselves.", "Legislative provisions": "The claim is backed by the existence of legislative provisions, such as the School-Based Management and Accountability Program, which requires schools to develop a plan for providing duty-free lunch periods for teachers. However, it is highlighted that these provisions lack enforcement and many teachers end up working during their supposed lunch breaks."}
