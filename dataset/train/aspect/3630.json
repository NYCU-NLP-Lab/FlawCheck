{"The claim is about a New York Post cover with the headline": "YOU'RE FIRED\" on Nov. 4 featuring an image of Donald Trump.", "The New York Post did not publish a cover with that headline on Nov": "4, 2020. The actual cover for that day had a different headline, \"NAILBITER,\" and featured an image of a woman biting her nails.", "The fabricated cover circulating on social media includes a quote that reads": "My fellow Americans, our long NATIONAL NIGHTMARE is over,\" which is not a genuine quote from the New York Post.", "The date on the fake cover is listed as Wednesday": "Nov. 4, 2020, even though news organizations did not call the election for Joe Biden until several days later. The authentic Nov. 4 cover of the New York Post did not mention the election outcome."}
