{"Verification of the source": "The expert likely checked the original source of the claim, which was a post circulated on Facebook groups. They may have investigated the credibility of the groups and the individuals who shared the post.", "Image verification": "The expert conducted a reverse image search to determine the origin of the images used in the claim. They found that the images were actually from a news article published in 2012 about a police raid on call girls in a hotel in Wenzhou, China. This finding undermines the authenticity of the claim.", "Contacting relevant parties": "The expert reached out to Congress spokesperson Priyanka Chaturvedi to confirm the claim. Chaturvedi informed the expert that there is no Congress worker named 'Shabana Sara Ali' in Madhya Pradesh and that the image used in the claim actually belonged to Gurpreet Kaur Chadha, a Vice President of Mumbai Regional Mahila Congress Committee. This contact with a relevant party helped verify the inaccuracy of the claim.", "Social media analysis": "The expert examined the spread of the claim on social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter. They identified multiple instances of the claim being shared by different users and groups, including some associated with the BJP. This analysis helped establish the potential political motivations behind the dissemination of the false information."}
