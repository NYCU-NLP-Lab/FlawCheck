{"Individual mandate to buy health insurance": "Both the Massachusetts plan and the national health plan (Obamacare) require individuals to purchase health insurance or face penalties. The penalty structures may vary between the two plans.", "Employer responsibilities for offering health insurance": "In Massachusetts, companies with more than 10 employees are required to offer health insurance or pay a penalty. Under the federal law, companies with 50 or more employees have a similar responsibility, although it is not technically a mandate. Employers only pay fines if their workers qualify for tax credits to buy insurance.", "Health insurance exchanges": "Both the Massachusetts and national plans utilize voluntary \"exchanges\" where individuals and small businesses can purchase private-sector health insurance. These exchanges offer a variety of plans with different benefits and premium levels.", "Affordability subsidies": "Both plans provide government subsidies to lower-income individuals and families to help them afford their health insurance premiums. These subsidies aim to make health insurance more affordable for those who need financial assistance."}
