{"Confirmation from CNN and PolitiFact": "CNN and PolitiFact confirmed that the chyron claiming the Boulder shooter was \"factually Arabic, but morally white\" did not run on the air. This confirmation from reputable sources adds credibility to the claim's inauthenticity.", "Satirical source": "The chyron was created by the Babylon Bee, a well-known satire website. The fact that the chyron originated from a satirical source indicates that it was not meant to be taken seriously.", "Lack of evidence in CNN programming": "A review of CNN programming on TVEyes, a media monitoring service, confirmed that the chyron did not appear on air. This absence of evidence further supports the claim's inauthenticity.", "Statements from CNN spokesperson and interview participants": "CNN spokesperson Shimrit Sheetrit explicitly stated that the chyron was fake and did not appear on their air. Additionally, the interview participants, Brooke Baldwin and Lucy Kafanov, did not make any claims about the shooter being \"factually Arabic, but morally white.\" Their statements contradict the content of the chyron, reinforcing its falseness."}
