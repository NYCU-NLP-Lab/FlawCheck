{"Rep": "Jeff Denham's statement: Rep. Jeff Denham, a Republican, claimed in an interview with NPR that Barack Obama, Chuck Schumer, and Hillary Clinton all voted for a border wall as senators. This statement is the basis of the claim being evaluated.", "Denham": "s reference to bipartisan support: Denham argued that a DACA/border bill should not be controversial because top Democrats have previously supported border security, including a border wall. He specifically mentioned the bipartisan support from Obama, Schumer, and Clinton in the past.", "Contextualizing the claim": "The expert's verdict points out that the claim takes things out of context. It highlights that the fence authorized in 2006, which Obama, Clinton, and Schumer voted for, was less ambitious than the \"big, beautiful wall\" proposed by President Trump. This distinction is crucial in evaluating the authenticity of the claim.", "Secure Fence Act of 2006": "The expert's verdict mentions the Secure Fence Act of 2006, which authorized the construction of approximately 700 miles of fencing, vehicle barriers, checkpoints, lighting, and advanced technology along certain stretches of the US-Mexico border. This act serves as evidence that Obama, Clinton, and Schumer did support border security measures, although the specifics of their support may differ from the claim's assertion of a border wall."}
