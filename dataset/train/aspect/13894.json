{"A comparison of Navy budget requests and congressional appropriations": "The expert analyzes the amounts requested by President Obama for the Navy budget and compares them to the amounts actually appropriated by Congress. This comparison shows that in four of the first five years of the Obama administration, Congress allocated less money to the Navy than what was requested.", "The Budget Control Act of 2011 and sequestration": "The expert explains how the Budget Control Act of 2011, which included automatic budget cuts known as sequestration, impacted defense spending, including the Navy. This act was passed in exchange for raising the borrowing limit and resulted in $1.2 trillion in budget cuts over 10 years, with half of the cuts affecting defense spending.", "Different funding streams for the Navy and Obamacare": "The expert clarifies that the Navy is funded through discretionary spending, which is subject to annual appropriations by Congress. On the other hand, Obamacare (the Affordable Care Act) is funded through specially enacted taxes and long-term Medicare savings, not relying on annual appropriations. This highlights that the Navy and Obamacare have separate funding sources and are not directly connected.", "Lack of evidence linking Navy cuts to Obamacare": "The expert mentions that the claim made by Ed Gillespie, the Republican candidate, about the Navy being slashed to pay for more Obamacare lacks evidence. The expert states that Gillespie's campaign did not provide any concrete link between the two, further suggesting that the claim may not be authentic."}
