{"Jacky Rosen": "s statement: The expert's verdict includes a direct quote from Jacky Rosen herself, where she states that she caucused for Hillary Clinton and is proud to stand on the ticket with her. This statement directly contradicts the claim that she has refused to disclose her support for either Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton.", "Lack of evidence": "The expert's verdict mentions that there is no evidence or mention of Jacky Rosen's presidential endorsement in articles from reputable sources like the Laughlin Nevada Times and Las Vegas Sun. This lack of information further supports the authenticity of Rosen's claim that she openly supported Clinton.", "Confirmation from a political reporter": "The expert's verdict states that a political reporter from the Associated Press, Michelle Rindels, interviewed Rosen and confirmed that she openly supported Clinton. This confirmation from a reputable source adds credibility to Rosen's endorsement.", "NRCC": "s interpretation: The expert's verdict includes the NRCC's spokesperson's email response, where they claim that there is a difference between caucusing and endorsing. This interpretation by the NRCC adds another perspective to the situation but does not provide concrete evidence to refute Rosen's claim."}
