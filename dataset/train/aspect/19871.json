{"The headline of the article is misleading and inaccurate": "giving the wrong impression that a potential recount is underway in Florida.", "The lawsuit mentioned in the article alleges voter fraud in Florida and aims to force a recount of votes": "claiming that Hillary Clinton would have won the election without alleged impropriety.", "The election results in Florida were certified on November 22 with only minor reported problems": "and there is no evidence of \"massive voter fraud.\"", "Under Florida law": "a recount is triggered if a candidate wins by 0.5 percent or less, and Trump's margin of victory over Clinton was about 1.4 percent. State officials have not pushed for a recount."}
