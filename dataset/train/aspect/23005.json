{"The claim is based on a statement made by Michele Bachmann during a debate in New Hampshire": "where she referenced the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) as the source of the information.", "The CBO report mentioned by Bachmann does acknowledge that the health care law will have an impact on the labor market": "stating that it will reduce the amount of labor used in the economy by roughly half a percent.", "However": "the CBO report also highlights that the reduction in labor is primarily due to workers choosing not to work because they no longer have to work solely for health insurance. This aspect suggests that the claim of Obamacare killing 800,000 jobs may be an oversimplification or misinterpretation of the CBO's findings.", "The CBO report also mentions that the overall impact on economic productivity or output is uncertain and may not be felt for several years": "as workers and employers need time to recognize and adapt to the new incentives provided by the health care law. This aspect adds further complexity to the claim and suggests that the long-term effects of Obamacare on the labor market are still uncertain."}
