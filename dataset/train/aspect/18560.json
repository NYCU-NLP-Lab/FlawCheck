{"The source of the statistic": "The expert mentions that the statistic claiming that Abigail Spanberger has voted with Nancy Pelosi over 90% of the time comes from ProPublica, a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative news service based in New York. This establishes the credibility of the source providing the data.", "Comparison to other Democrats": "The expert highlights that Spanberger is one of the least loyal Democrats to Pelosi, with only 10 Democrats voting in greater opposition to Pelosi than Spanberger. This comparison puts Spanberger's voting record in perspective and shows that she is not as aligned with Pelosi as some other Democrats.", "Speaker": "s discretionary voting: The expert mentions that speakers vote at their discretion, usually on the most partisanly-charged issues. This implies that Pelosi's voting record may not necessarily reflect the overall alignment between her and Spanberger, as Pelosi participates in only a small percentage (9%) of House votes. This aspect highlights the limitation of using Pelosi's voting record as a sole measure of Spanberger's alignment.", "Disagreements on specific bills": "The expert mentions specific instances where Spanberger and Pelosi disagreed on certain bills, such as the Heroes Act, a budget deal, and a bill banning flavored e-cigarettes and menthol cigarettes. This indicates that there have been instances where Spanberger did not align with Pelosi's position, further challenging the claim that she has voted with Pelosi over 90% of the time."}
