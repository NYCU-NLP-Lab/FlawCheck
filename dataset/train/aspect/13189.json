{"The claim is based on blog posts and websites": "The expert's verdict highlights that the claim about Reps. Donald Payne and Frank Pallone being socialists is derived from blog posts and websites. This suggests that the authenticity of the claim can be questioned as it is not based on official sources or verified information.", "Mention of the Congressional Progressive Caucus": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim associates Payne and Pallone with the Congressional Progressive Caucus, which is said to have been created by the Democratic Socialists of America. This aspect adds weight to the claim but requires further investigation to determine the accuracy of the association.", "Denial from actual socialists": "The expert's verdict mentions that real card-carrying socialists, including representatives from the Democratic Socialists of America, deny that Payne and Pallone are socialists. This aspect raises doubts about the claim's authenticity, as it contradicts the association made in the claim.", "Lack of formal membership in the Democratic Socialists of America": "The expert's verdict states that there is no formal membership of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) among members of Congress, including Payne and Pallone. This aspect undermines the claim's credibility, as it suggests that the claim is based on a fraudulent list and that even self-described democratic socialist Bernie Sanders is not a formal member of the DSA."}
