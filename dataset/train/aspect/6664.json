{"The claim states that Sen": "Tim Kaine \"approves of and even applauds his son's participation in a known terrorist organization, #Antifa.\" This claim is made by Corey Stewart, the Republican candidate for U.S. Senate in Virginia.", "The claim is supported by the fact that Sen": "Kaine's son, Linwood Michael \"Woody\" Kaine, has attended protests affiliated with Antifa, a far-left collection of autonomous anti-fascist groups. This information is confirmed by local reports and his arrest for counter-protesting at a pro-Donald Trump rally in Minnesota on March 4, 2017.", "The evidence provided by the Stewart campaign includes an article in The Federalist": "a conservative website, which reports on Woody Kaine's arrest and his involvement in the counter-protest. This article suggests that Kaine's son's actions align with the activities of Antifa.", "However": "Sen. Kaine has publicly condemned non-peaceful protests, including those by Antifa. In a letter sent to constituents inquiring about Antifa, Kaine stated that he condemns all violence at any political demonstration, including any violent activities by members of Antifa. This statement contradicts the claim made by Stewart and questions the authenticity of the accusation."}
