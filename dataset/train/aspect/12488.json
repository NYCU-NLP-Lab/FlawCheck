{"Lack of evidence": "The expert's verdict highlights that there is no indication or evidence to support the claim that Democrat Jon Ossoff could face a federal investigation. The only basis for the claim is a letter sent by the Georgia Republican Party requesting an investigation, but it is unclear if the committee has responded to this request.", "Distortion of facts": "The expert points out that the ad from Republican Sen. David Perdue's campaign distorts the facts by suggesting a \"China scandal\" involving Ossoff that is getting worse. However, the expert clarifies that there is no actual scandal, and it is the distortions in the ad that are worsening.", "Jurisdiction of the Senate Select Committee on Ethics": "The expert explains that the committee does not have the authority to investigate allegations made against candidates. Its jurisdiction extends to the conduct of individuals in their roles as members, officers, or employees of the Senate. Therefore, the claim that Ossoff could face investigation falls outside the committee's jurisdiction.", "Unlikelihood of investigation": "The expert emphasizes that even if Ossoff were to win the election, the likelihood of an investigation is extremely low. The committee rarely conducts investigations, and the issue regarding Ossoff's financial disclosure reports has already been corrected by filing an amendment. Therefore, the claim of a potential federal investigation is deemed improbable."}
