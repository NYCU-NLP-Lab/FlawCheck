{"The use of statistical data": "The expert analyzed the claim by examining the statistical data provided by the New Jersey Sierra Club and compared it to the research conducted by Rutgers University's Grant F. Walton Center for Remote Sensing and Spatial Analysis. This involved determining the number of acres developed per day and converting it into the equivalent number of football fields.", "Comparison with established standards": "The expert investigated the definition of a football field and found that the National Football League includes both end zones in its measurement. This allowed for a more accurate calculation of the number of football fields being lost to development.", "Examination of time frame": "The expert pointed out that the Sierra Club's estimate was based on data from 2007, which was four years prior to the current analysis. They highlighted the importance of considering the changes in the economy and development patterns over time.", "Evaluation of broader context": "The expert acknowledged that while development does increase the risk of flooding, construction activity has actually declined nationwide. They emphasized the need to consider the overall trends and factors influencing development in New Jersey, rather than solely focusing on the Sierra Club's claim."}
