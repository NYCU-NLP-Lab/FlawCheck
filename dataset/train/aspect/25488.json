{"Release of an official accounting report": "The Mueller investigation released an accounting report in December 2017, which covered the first four and a half months of the probe. This report provided specific details on the expenses incurred during that period, including staff salaries, benefits, equipment, travel, rent, utilities, and supplies.", "Comparison to previous estimates": "President Trump and his lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, had previously estimated the cost of the Mueller probe to be $10 million. However, Trump's tweet increased the estimate to $20 million. This comparison allowed for a verification of the claim by examining the consistency of the figures provided.", "Prorating expenses": "By prorating the expenses incurred during the first four and a half months of the investigation to a full year, it was possible to estimate the approximate total expenditure at the time of Trump's tweet. This calculation revealed that the actual expenses were well below the $20 million cited by Trump.", "Funding and oversight": "The Mueller investigation is funded through mandatory spending, which ensures independence from executive branch influence. However, the Justice Department has oversight to prevent wasteful spending. This aspect verifies that the investigation's expenses are monitored and controlled, further supporting the assessment that the claim of it being \"soon to be $20,000,000\" is not accurate."}
