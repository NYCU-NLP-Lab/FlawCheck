{"The claim is based on a report from the Taxpayer Advocate Service": "s 2013 report to Congress, which addresses the complexity of the U.S. tax code and states that individuals and businesses spend about 6.1 billion hours a year complying with tax-filing requirements.", "The number is calculated by multiplying the number of times each type of tax form was filed in 2010 by the estimated time it takes to complete each form": "as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995.", "The estimate includes the time spent by both businesses and individuals": "not just private citizens.", "The estimate acknowledges that the calculation may have flaws": "as it assumes an average time for completing forms and does not account for variations in familiarity or expertise with tax forms."}
