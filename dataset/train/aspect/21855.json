{"Investigation of the source": "The expert examined the original claim and traced it back to its source, the now-defunct website Taiviral.com. The expert also discovered that the story was initially published on another junk news site, News4KTLA.com. This aspect involved verifying the credibility and reputation of the sources.", "Analysis of the content": "The expert analyzed the content of the claim and identified several red flags. They noted that Taiviral.com had a history of publishing hoaxes and sensationalized stories, including ones related to bestiality. The expert also highlighted inconsistencies within the claim itself, such as the mention of a goat-human hybrid baby, which is biologically implausible.", "Cross": "referencing with other sources: To verify the authenticity of the claim, the expert cross-referenced it with other reliable sources. They found a news article from the Singapore-based Straits Times, which reported a similar but unrelated incident involving a deformed goat in Indonesia. The expert concluded that the photograph of the alleged goat-child was taken from this unrelated incident, further discrediting the claim.", "Biological analysis": "The expert provided a scientific perspective by explaining the biological impossibility of interbreeding between different species, particularly those from different genera. They mentioned that while mules (offspring of horses and donkeys) are a known exception, interbreeding between humans and goats is not biologically feasible. This aspect involved applying scientific knowledge to refute the claim's plausibility."}
