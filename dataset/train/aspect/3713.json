{"New York and Nevada have restricted access to chloroquine prescriptions to avoid stockpiling of the drug": "There are exemptions for clinical trials and patients hospitalized with COVID-19.", "Michigan has not taken any regulatory action related to chloroquine": "Instead, it has asked prescribers to not give the drug to potential stockpilers.", "Facebook pages and groups are promoting misleading information about several states": "decisions to restrict access to a malaria drug that could be used to treat COVID-19.", "The claim that the governors of Michigan": "New York, and Nevada have \"issued orders banning the prescription of hydroxychloroquine to patients with COVID-19\" is false. While New York and Nevada have limited access to chloroquine, neither of the actions comprises an outright ban on the drug. Michigan has not taken any formal action to restrict access to the drug."}
