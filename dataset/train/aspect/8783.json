{"Lack of evidence": "The expert's verdict mentions that there is no record of Albert Einstein ever saying or writing the quote in question. Despite his papers and quotes being archived in various databases, including the definitive collection \"The Ultimate Quotable Einstein\" from Princeton University Press, there is no mention of this quote.", "Inconsistencies and variations": "The expert's verdict points out that variations of the quote started to appear on webpages in 2012, the same year a scene from the movie \"Powder\" was uploaded to YouTube. The website Quote Investigator found that the phrasing of the quote has changed over time and different sets of pictures have been attached to it, suggesting that it may be fake.", "Source credibility": "The expert's verdict highlights that the quote is often circulated with a photo of Albert Einstein, lending an air of credibility to the claim. However, the expert points out that the quote cannot be traced back to any authentic source.", "Alternative quote with similar sentiment": "The expert's verdict mentions that while there is no evidence of Einstein saying the specific quote, he did express concerns about the negative impacts of technology in a letter to Otto Juliusburger in 1946. This alternative quote shares a similar sentiment but is not the same as the one being attributed to Einstein."}
