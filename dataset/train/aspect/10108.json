{"The spokesperson for Rubio referred to a March 2015 brief by the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond that noted a 41 percent decline in small banks between 2007 and 2013": "However, this decline is in a smaller category, not small and mid-size banks as Rubio claimed, and it includes data from before Dodd-Frank became law.", "Rubio": "s figure of over 40 percent decline in small and mid-size banks since Dodd-Frank is overstated. Estimates range from 12 percent to 16 percent decline in their numbers since 2010.", "Experts argue that a host of factors other than Dodd": "Frank are at play in the decline of small and mid-size banks. Consolidation, rather than closures, has been the main reason for the loss of banks. Laws passed in the 1980s and 1990s that eased barriers in banking across communities and state borders have also contributed to the decrease in small banks.", "Dodd": "Frank was primarily aimed at regulating big banks and preventing another financial crisis. It is not the main cause of the decline of small and mid-size banks."}
