{"The expert": "s verdict categorizes the claim as a \"Mixture\" because while ships have been diverted around the southern tip of Africa due to the Ever Given blockage, the maps used to demonstrate this phenomenon likely show regular traffic. This suggests that the claim is a combination of accurate information (diverted ships) and potentially misleading information (maps showing regular traffic).", "The expert mentions that shipping companies have indeed diverted some vessels to take the old": "fashioned route around Africa's Cape of Good Hope, but this is not necessarily indicative of an increase in traffic. It is a known and commonly used route for shipping regardless of the Suez Canal blockage.", "The expert highlights that the map shared on Twitter": "which shows a line of boats traveling around the Cape of Good Hope, accurately depicts shipping traffic after the Suez incident. However, it is unlikely to show an increase in traffic specifically caused by the blockage. This further supports the notion that the claim may not be entirely accurate."}
