{"Columbia University offered voluntary": "virtual commencement ceremonies for graduating seniors based on their race, ethnicity, gender or sexual identity, and socioeconomic status.", "The multicultural graduation ceremonies have been held by the university since at least 2012": "indicating a longstanding tradition.", "The events were not designed to segregate students or eliminate diversity at the main graduation ceremonies": "Instead, they aimed to provide a space for historically disenfranchised groups to celebrate their academic success with their identity or background in the forefront.", "The claim that Columbia University": "brought back segregation\" is misleading and lacks context, as it is common for higher education institutions to organize various graduation ceremonies, and students could attend multiple institution-sponsored commencement celebrations on a voluntary basis."}
