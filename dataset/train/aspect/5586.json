{"Lack of evidence in official sources": "The experts found no evidence of President John F. Kennedy making the quoted statement in any official sources, such as the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation website or his papers and addresses.", "Reference to a different source": "The experts found a reference to a similar statement in an article published in the Washington Daily News on October 2, 1963. The article quoted an anonymous U.S. official saying, \"If the United States ever experiences a 'Seven Days in May' it will come from the CIA, and not the Pentagon.\"", "Attribution to a fictional book": "The experts noted that the phrase \"Seven Days in May\" mentioned in the article refers to a fictional book published in 1962, which portrays a military attempt to overthrow the U.S. government. This suggests that the quote may have been inspired by the book rather than being a direct statement from President Kennedy.", "Concerns within the administration": "The experts discovered that the article featuring the quote was the subject of concern in the administration, as indicated by a National Security Council meeting about Vietnam that took place on the same day. This suggests that the quote garnered attention and discussion within the government at the time."}
