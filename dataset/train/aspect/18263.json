{"The claim is based on a Facebook post from the": "Judge Jeanine Pirro has Fans\" page, which is described as an independent fan page for Pirro, a Fox News host allied with Trump.", "The post includes a screenshot of a CNN appearance by Maxine Waters with Anderson Cooper": "where she allegedly says her first act as president would be to impeach Donald Trump.", "The chyron at the bottom of the screenshot": "which reads \"Maxine Waters 2020,\" is confirmed to be fake. The original chyron said, \"Bill O\u2019Reilly Out at Fox News.\"", "The meme": "s intention is to falsely portray Waters as stating she would impeach Trump if elected president, which would be nonsensical since impeachment is a process carried out by Congress, not the president."}
