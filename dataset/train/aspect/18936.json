{"The Facebook post and its source": "The expert examined a Facebook post that claimed to show content from South Africa's sex education curriculum for grade 4 students in 2020. The post was shared by Vytjie Mentor, a South African politician who is a member of the African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP).", "Verification through reverse image search": "The expert conducted a Google reverse image search of the excerpt shown in the Facebook post. This search led them to an Afrikaans version of a children's book called \"Het die Ooievaar My Gebring?\" in a Netwerk24 news article. The book is a translated version of \"Did the Stork Bring Me?\" by Richard Pooler, originally published in English. The expert found multiple publishers and release dates for the book, indicating its existence prior to 2020.", "Unavailability of the book for purchase": "The expert found that the book \"Het die Ooievaar My Gebring?\" is no longer available for purchase, suggesting that it may not be a current or widely used resource in South Africa's sex education curriculum.", "Denial by South Africa": "s Department of Basic Education (BDE): The expert noted a statement from Elijah Mhlanga, a spokesman for the BDE, who confirmed on Twitter that the department is not familiar with the book and that it is not part of the curriculum. The BDE's denial adds to the evidence questioning the authenticity of the claim."}
