This information is relevant to the claim as it highlights the continued presence of thimerosal in certain vaccines.", "Documents demonstrating evacuation protocol": "The expert mentions that four loosely connected documents were provided to demonstrate the protocol of evacuating a building if a vaccine vial breaks. Two of these documents discuss mercury's classification as a hazardous chemical, emphasizing the need for proper management of discarded thimerosal-preserved vaccines.", "Missouri State University": "s contingency plan: The expert refers to a document from Missouri State University's \"Hazardous Waste & Hazardous Materials Contingency Plan\" that supports the claim that a building should be evacuated in case of a vaccine vial break. This document mentions the use of a mercury spill kit to handle spills of elemental mercury, reinforcing the potential harm associated with mercury release."}
