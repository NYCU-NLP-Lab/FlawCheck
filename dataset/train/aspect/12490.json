{"Clinton": "s explicit request for her emails to be made public: Clinton herself stated in an interview that if she had not asked for her emails to be made public, none of the controversy surrounding her use of a private email server would have been in the public arena. This is a direct aspect mentioned by the expert.", "State Department": "s decision to release the emails: The State Department responded to Clinton's request by deciding to release her emails as soon as possible. This decision was a direct response to Clinton's specific request and played a role in making the emails public.", "Existing Freedom of Information Act": "FOIA) requests: Prior to Clinton's request, numerous media outlets and conservative organizations had already submitted FOIA requests to the State Department for various records, including Clinton's emails. These requests would have eventually made the emails public, regardless of Clinton's own request.", "Lawsuit and pressure from Jason Leopold": "Journalist Jason Leopold filed a FOIA request in November 2014 and subsequently filed a lawsuit in January 2015 due to the slow response from the State Department. The State Department's eventual response to Leopold's lawsuit mentioned that the release of Clinton's emails would satisfy a significant portion of his FOIA request. Leopold's actions and the pressure from his lawsuit contributed to the eventual public release of Clinton's emails."}
