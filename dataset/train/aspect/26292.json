{"Rhode Island": "s sales tax rate is the second-highest in the nation, which indicates that the state relies heavily on sales tax revenue.", "The sales tax in Rhode Island is limited to tangible goods and does not apply to services": "further narrowing the tax base.", "Approximately 83 categories of items are exempt from the sales tax": "including food, clothing, medicines, art works, and wine.", "The claim of": "only 25 percent of what people buy is subject to Rhode Island's sales tax\" is based on a calculation by John L. Mikesell, an expert on state taxation policies, who estimated the percentage of the state's total personal spending that is taxed.
