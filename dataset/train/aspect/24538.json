{"Department of Defense data": "The expert verified the authenticity of the claim by referring to the Department of Defense data, which was provided by Leticia Van de Putte's spokesman. This data indicated that 588 Texans were killed in action from Oct. 1, 2011, to Jan. 24, 2013.", "Table of figures": "The expert also examined a table of figures that was emailed to them by Van de Putte's spokesman. This table, prepared by the Defense Manpower Data Center, provided information on the marital status of the Texans killed in action. It confirmed that 310 of them were married, while 253 were not married, 24 were divorced, and one had an unknown marital status.", "Clarification by Van de Putte": "The expert took into account the clarification made by Van de Putte herself. After initially stating the figure of 250, she clarified that it was an incorrect figure due to staff error. She mentioned that the actual number of Texans who would qualify for the proposed tax break was probably around 250 since 9/11.", "Online counts from Defense Department": "The expert cross-referenced the information provided by Van de Putte with up-to-date online counts of Americans killed in action. The Defense Department spokeswoman confirmed that as of May 2, 2013, 588 Texans had been killed in action since Oct. 1, 2011, which aligned with the data provided earlier."}
