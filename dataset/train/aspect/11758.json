{"Inconsistent date": "The claim states that the WD-40 print advertisement is from 1964, but the expert points out that the product was actually released in 1958. This inconsistency raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Lack of additional evidence": "The expert mentions that the image of the alleged advertisement is the only one available on the internet. If the ad were genuine, there should be more than one photograph or documentation supporting its existence. The absence of additional evidence raises suspicions about the claim's authenticity.", "Digital manipulation": "The expert notes that certain aspects of the image suggest it may be a digitally altered photograph. The straight lettering on a crinkled paper background indicates that the text was likely added as a digital overlay. This manipulation further questions the credibility of the claim.", "Inaccurate details": "The image describes the product as \"WD 40\" instead of the correct name, WD-40. Additionally, it references a \"red knob\" that was not a feature of the product at the time. These inaccuracies suggest that the image may not accurately represent a genuine advertisement and cast doubt on the claim's authenticity."}
