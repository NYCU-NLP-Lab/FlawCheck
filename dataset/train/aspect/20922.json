{"The comparison of nonfarm employment data": "The expert analyzed the employment data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics for Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Ohio to determine if there was an increase or decrease in employment. The data showed that employment had increased in these states, contradicting the claim that raising the minimum wage would put more money in people's pockets.", "Verification of campaign": "s press release: The expert examined a press release issued by Castro's campaign, which stated that non-farm payrolls were down in Ohio, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. However, the expert pointed out that the data was preliminary and subject to revision, and that the employment had actually increased in those states since Trump took office.", "Comparison of wage growth": "The expert cited data from the Economic Policy Institute, a think tank advocating for low- and middle-income earners, which showed that wages of the bottom 90% of wage earners had increased by 22.2% since 1979, even after adjusting for inflation. This contradicted the claim that raising the minimum wage was necessary to put more money in people's pockets.", "Comparison of minimum wage and universal basic income": "The expert analyzed the claim that raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour would put more money in people's pockets than giving them $1,000 a month through a universal basic income (UBI) plan. The expert pointed out that while raising the minimum wage would provide a monthly increase in income, the UBI plan would provide a fixed amount of $1,000 per month to all U.S. citizens over the age of 18, potentially resulting in higher monthly income for some individuals."}
