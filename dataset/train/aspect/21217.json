{"The photo itself": "taken by photographer Jeff Kowalsky on April 30, shows a bearded man yelling at two masked police officers at Michigan's state Capitol. This visual evidence is one aspect used to verify the authenticity of the claim.", "The Detroit Free Press published a story on May 5 identifying the man in the photo as Brian Cash": "a 52-year-old flooring installer from New Hudson, Michigan. This identification contradicts the claim that the man is Rob Cantrall, a right-wing activist.", "The claim alleges that the man in the photo is Rob Cantrall": "a longtime white supremacist and member of The Proud Boys. However, the Southern Poverty Law Center has labeled The Proud Boys as a \"hate group.\" This information supports the expert's verdict that the man in the photo is not Cantrall.", "Brian Cash": "the man identified in the photo, expressed his distress at being associated with someone he considers a racist. This statement from Cash further supports the expert's verdict that the claim is false."}
