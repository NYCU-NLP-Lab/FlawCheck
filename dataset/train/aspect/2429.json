This indicates that the claim is supported by a reliable source.", "The claim was verified by consulting a number of experts on subsidies": "including Todd Berry, Jon Peacock, Michael Leeds, Charley Ballard, Jeffrey Michael, Sean Snaith, Michael Hicks, and Tim Bartik. These experts, who have knowledge and expertise in the field, confirmed that the $3 billion incentive offer to Foxconn is indeed the largest ever subsidy provided by a state to a foreign company.", "The experts specifically mentioned that the data on subsidies provided by Good Jobs First is solid and reliable": "This further strengthens the authenticity of the claim.", "The claim is also supported by the fact that the incentives offered by Wisconsin to Foxconn are tied to the company making investments in the plant and in payroll": "This indicates that the incentives are not simply a gift, but rather a strategic investment by the state."}
