{"The language of the American Jobs Act of 2011": "The expert referred to the specific language of the bill, Title II, Subtitle B, which provides $30 billion for \"teacher stabilization\" and Title II, Subtitle C, which provides $5 billion for \"First Responder Stabilization.\" These sections outline the allocation of funds to prevent teacher layoffs and support the jobs of police officers and firefighters.", "Funding distribution": "The bill states that the allocated funds for teachers would be distributed to states based on their population. The states can retain a certain percentage of the funds for administrative costs and state-funded early learning programs, while the rest would go to local districts. The districts are required to use the funds for compensation, benefits, and support services to retain current employees or hire new ones.", "Restrictions on fund usage": "The legislation prohibits districts from using the funds for other administrative purposes and states from using the money to boost rainy-day funds or reduce debt. Additionally, states must agree to maintain their education spending at previous levels.", "Verification through primary sources": "The expert's verdict mentions contacting Representative David Scott's office for more information and referring to the actual language of the bill. By directly examining the primary sources, the expert verified the authenticity of the claim made by Rep. David Scott."}
