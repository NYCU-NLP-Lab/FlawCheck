{"The official poverty measure": "The U.S. Census Bureau determines national poverty rates using income and the cost of food. By this measure, the official poverty rate was 14.5 percent in 2013, while during the 1970s it ranged between 11.7 and 12.6 percent.", "Alternative calculations": "Experts also rely on a different calculation that takes into account factors such as declining work rates, stagnant wages, the rise of female-headed families, inferior education, and the arrival of immigrants with poor education and low skills. These factors contribute to an increase in the poverty rate.", "Poverty rates for different demographics": "While the overall official poverty rate may have increased since the 1970s, it's important to note that poverty rates for the elderly have actually fallen during this period, thanks to increases in Social Security. On the other hand, the poverty rate for children has increased, which poses a more complex issue.", "Factors contributing to poverty": "Experts point out that various factors contribute to the increase in poverty rates, including declining work rates, stagnant wages, changes in family structures, and educational disparities. These underlying factors have remained strong and continue to drive poverty rates in the United States."}
