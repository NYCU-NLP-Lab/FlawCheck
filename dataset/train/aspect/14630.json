{"The claim states that the current city mayor": "Kasim Reed, has been virtually absent in terms of regional cooperation for the last eight years. This is supported by the fact that Reed had a poor attendance record at meetings of the Atlanta Regional Commission, missing 24 out of 36 total meetings between 2010 and August 2013.", "However": "Reed has been actively involved in advancing the city's future through initiatives such as the deepening of the Port of Savannah, which supports about 370,000 jobs across the state. Reed worked with Republican lawmakers and the state's Republican governor to push the project forward, securing $50 million in funding from the Trump administration.", "Reed has also played a role in promoting the expansion of Hartsfield Jackson Atlanta International Airport": "an important economic driver for the region. He struck an agreement with Delta Airlines to keep the company in Atlanta for the next two decades.", "The Atlanta region has seen significant job growth and the addition of major companies like Mercedes": "Benz and State Farm, which located just outside the city. This indicates a level of regional cooperation and economic development that can be attributed, at least in part, to Reed's efforts."}
