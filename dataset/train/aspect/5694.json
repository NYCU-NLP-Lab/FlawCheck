{"The claim is based on a statement made by Cleveland City Councilman Mike Polensek in an interview on WEWS Channel 5": "where he expressed his opinion that it is ironic for First Energy Corp. to have their name on the Cleveland Browns' stadium while Cleveland Public Power supplies the electricity.", "The expert": "s verdict also includes information about the financial implications of the original lease agreement for the stadium. Cleveland City Councilman Mike Polensek argues that the lease is one-sided, with the Browns paying only $250,000 a year in rent while the city is burdened with $13 million a year in debt and capital maintenance costs. This adds context to the claim's mention of the stadium's cost to the city."}
