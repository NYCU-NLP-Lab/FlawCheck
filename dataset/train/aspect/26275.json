{"The claim is based on a guideline memo issued by the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in September 2011": "2. The memo stated that \"religious items\" including Bibles could not be used or given away during visits with patients.", "The memo caused public outcry and was interpreted as an absolute ban on visitors using Bibles or other religious materials": "4. The policy stated in the memo was later clarified by Walter Reed officials, who stated that it had not been enforced and had since been rescinded."}
