{"Confirmation of the origin and source of the claim": "The expert verified that the claim originated from Jim Heinrichs, who shared it on social media on February 18, 2021. The expert also confirmed that the claim was circulated without proper citation or linking to the original post.", "Verification of the location and distribution of the chicken products": "The expert conducted a Google search and found a Walmart store in Drayton Valley, Alberta, Canada, which matched the claim. They also contacted Maple Leaf Foods, the producer and distributor of the chicken, who confirmed that the product depicted in the image is distributed throughout Canada, including the Walmart in Drayton Valley. The expert further confirmed that the product is not sold in any U.S. stores.", "Assessment by food safety experts": "The expert sent the image to Janet Riley, a spokesperson for Maple Leaf Foods, who reviewed it with the company's food safety team. They concluded that the red spots on the chicken thighs were common and harmless blood spots or meat particles that can be transferred during the processing of the chicken. They affirmed that the chicken products are safe, wholesome, government inspected, and that claims of lice infestation are untrue. Additionally, a meat scientist at the University of Arkansas, Janeal Yancey, confirmed that the red spots in the photo were not caused by poultry lice and explained the reasons behind it.", "Consideration of the chicken production process": "The expert noted that lice infestation is extremely rare in commercial poultry, especially in broilers, which are young birds raised specifically for meat. They explained that lice are more prevalent in hot and humid climates, making it unlikely for a poultry farm in Canada during winter to have lice infestation. The expert also mentioned that red markings resulting from blood spots or meat particles, like those seen in the photograph, are rare due to the water chilling process used in commercial chicken meat production."}
