{"Discrepancies in the narrative": "The expert identified inconsistencies in the narrative presented in the video and the accompanying text. The video claimed to show the incident at Nahar Singh's house in Morna village, but the expert found that it was actually clipped from a theatrical video unrelated to the incident.", "Analysis of the video footage": "The expert analyzed the video footage and found that it was professionally filmed, with different camera angles. This suggested that it was not a spontaneous recording of a real incident, but rather a staged scene from a theatrical video.", "Identification of the source": "The expert traced the source of the video to a YouTube channel called CWE (Continental Wrestling Entertainment), which specializes in theatrical videos. The channel had previously shared similar videos as real incidents, indicating a pattern of misrepresentation.", "Verification of the incident": "The expert cross-referenced the video with credible reports and found that the actual incident involved an argument between family members of Nahar Singh and the police, not a group of people beating a cop. Five individuals, including Nahar Singh, were arrested in connection with the incident."}
