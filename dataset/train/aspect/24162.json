{"Lack of concrete evidence": "The expert's verdict highlights that neither Senator Rand Paul's office nor any expert could provide a study or evidence that supports the claim that 70 percent of foreign aid is stolen. This lack of concrete evidence raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Anecdotal evidence": "While the expert's verdict mentions that Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson witnessed military forces stealing food aid, it is important to note that this is anecdotal evidence and does not provide a comprehensive picture of the overall percentage of aid that is stolen.", "Indirect corruption ranking": "The expert's verdict mentions that a private consulting group, PRS, judged countries receiving 76 percent of American aid to be the most corrupt. However, this corruption ranking is an indirect measure and does not directly quantify the percentage of aid stolen. It primarily focuses on factors like patronage, nepotism, and close ties between politics and business.", "Inherent difficulty in quantifying stolen aid": "The expert's verdict emphasizes that it is inherently impossible to calculate the exact percentage of aid stolen. The stealing of aid often occurs in secret and employs various deceptive tactics to avoid detection. As a result, there is no reliable data available to determine the precise extent of aid theft."}
