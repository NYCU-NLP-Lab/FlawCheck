{"Verification through reliable sources": "The expert checked with Organizing for Action, a pro-Obama group that handles the president's social media accounts, to confirm the claim. They obtained information from the Joint Economic Committee, a bipartisan panel in Congress, which provided the basis for the claim.", "Analysis of methodology": "The expert examined how the Joint Economic Committee calculated the number of children kept out of poverty due to unemployment insurance. They found that the calculations were based on U.S. Census Bureau data and used a specific threshold to determine poverty status.", "Comparison to original claim": "The expert noted that the claim made on Barack Obama's Facebook page stated \"more than 620,000 children,\" while the actual figure from the Joint Economic Committee report was slightly less than 620,000. They highlighted the minor discrepancy between the claim and the report.", "Evaluation of poverty measurement": "The expert discussed the use of the Supplemental Poverty Measure by the Joint Economic Committee instead of the traditional method of measuring poverty. They raised the importance of understanding the threshold for what counted as being in poverty and the implications of using different poverty measurement approaches."}
