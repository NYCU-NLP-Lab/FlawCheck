{"The photo shows a packed beach with CNN": "s logo at the bottom and the words \"Jacksonville Beach reopens\". However, it was confirmed that CNN did not air the image or claim that it depicts Jacksonville Beach in 2020.", "A reverse": "image search was conducted, which revealed that the photo was taken in 2013, not 2020. This indicates that the image is not recent and does not reflect the current situation in Florida.", "The presence of mountains in the background of the photo was identified as a red flag": "Since there are no mountains in Florida, it further supports the conclusion that the image is not from the state.", "The photo was traced back to its original source": "which was found to be Copacabana beach in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on July 28, 2013. This information, along with news reports confirming the event, provided concrete evidence that the photo was taken in Brazil and has no connection to CNN, Florida, or the reopening of beaches in the United States."}
