{"The source of the claim": "The expert's verdict highlights that the claim originated from a long piece of text that circulated on social media. It is stated that the text was supposedly written by a Canadian politician and detailed Canada's alleged COVID-19 \"reset\" plan.", "Lack of credible evidence": "The expert's verdict mentions that the text containing the claim is unsourced and does not reflect reality. It states that no \"global reset\" or \"world debt reset\" plan exists, indicating a lack of credible evidence to support the claim.", "Discrepancies in the content": "The expert's verdict provides snippets of the text, which include statements from a supposed committee member within the Liberal Party of Canada. However, it is mentioned that the opinions of around 30% of the committee members who oppose the alleged plan have been ignored. These discrepancies in the content raise doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Inconsistent with official guidance": "The expert's verdict advises following the guidance of reputable sources like the CDC or WHO for protecting communities from COVID-19. This suggests that the claim's content, which includes strict lockdowns, mandatory vaccines, and forced isolation facilities, may not align with the official guidance provided by these reputable sources."}
