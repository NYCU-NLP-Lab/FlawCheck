{"Clarification of the claim": "The expert examined the claim made by Sean Casten regarding double taxation in Hinsdale, Illinois under the GOP tax law. The expert sought to understand the specific meaning of Casten's statement, whether it referred to an increase in tax bills or a larger portion of income being subject to taxation.", "Analysis of IRS data": "To verify the claim, the expert analyzed IRS data provided by Casten's spokeswoman. The data revealed that Hinsdale residents who previously claimed deductions for state income and property taxes had an average deduction of over $48,000 in 2015 and nearly $44,000 in the following year. This information was crucial in understanding the potential impact of the new tax law on Hinsdale taxpayers.", "Examination of the SALT deduction cap": "The expert highlighted the significant change brought about by the GOP tax law, which capped the State and Local Tax (SALT) deductions at $10,000. By comparing the average deductions claimed by Hinsdale residents with the new cap, it was determined that approximately $35,000 would have been disallowed for deductions each year if the new rules had been in effect in 2015 and 2016.", "Consideration of broader tax law changes": "The expert acknowledged that the SALT deduction cap was not the only modification introduced by the GOP tax law. Other alterations, such as lower federal tax rates, expanded credits for children, and an increased standard deduction, could potentially offset the impact of the SALT deduction limitation for many Hinsdale residents. The expert recognized the need to assess the overall effect of the tax law on taxpayers in order to determine if Casten's claim was accurate."}
