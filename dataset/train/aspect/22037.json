{"Uncertainty for employers": "The expert mentions that the payroll tax break creates uncertainty for employers, as it is unclear where things will stand next year after the election. This aspect suggests that the claim's assertion of helping employers is not accurate.", "Potential payment obligations": "The expert explains that if employers simply let workers keep the deferred payroll taxes, they could potentially face a significant payment to the Trust Funds early next year. This aspect contradicts the claim's assertion that the tax break helps employers.", "Prudent advice for businesses": "The expert refers to an article in Inc. magazine that advises businesses to \"hold tight and not change withholdings\" after Trump's announcement. This advice aligns with the expert's opinion that the tax break does not necessarily benefit employers.", "Unlikelihood of workers paying back deferred taxes": "The expert cites economist Eugene Steuerle, who believes that it is unlikely that a future Congress would force workers to pay back the amount deferred. This aspect supports the expert's argument against the claim's assertion that the tax break defunds years of Social Security."}
