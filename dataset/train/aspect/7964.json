{"The claim is supported by a paper written by two Princeton University economists": "Alan Blinder and Mark Watson, which analyzed quarterly economic data from 1947 through mid 2013 and the National Bureau of Economic Research's official list of recessions.", "The research found that there have been 11 official recessions since 1947": "with 41 occurring under Republican presidents and only 8 occurring under Democratic presidents, indicating that recessions are more common under Republican leadership.", "The study also revealed that of the 11 recessions since 1947": "9 started under Republican presidents, while only 2 started under Democratic presidents, further emphasizing the higher frequency of recessions under Republican administrations.", "The research also examined historical data dating back to 1875": "which showed a similar trend, although less pronounced, suggesting that the pattern of more frequent recessions under Republican presidents has persisted over time."}
