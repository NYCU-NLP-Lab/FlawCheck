{"The claim is supported by Donald Trump": "s statement at a campaign rally in Waukesha, Wis., where he repeatedly mentioned the theme of \"Follow the money\" and accused Hillary Clinton of receiving $100 million in contributions from Wall Street and hedge funds.", "News reports and articles from reputable sources have covered Clinton": "s support from the financial sector throughout the campaign, including a report by the Wall Street Journal in February 2016 that estimated Wall Street had contributed over $100 million to the Clintons' political campaigns, charitable foundation, and personal finances since the 1990s.", "The nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics and its website OpenSecrets": "org are considered the go-to source for campaign finance information. The center categorizes the securities and investment industry as \"Wall Street\" and includes related industries. Contributions to Clinton's campaign and super PACs supporting her were counted, not just from the securities and investment industry but also from related industries.", "The contributions to Clinton": "s campaign and super PACs come from individual employees, members of organizations, or political action committees tied to the organizations. The Center for Responsive Politics has reported that most of the \"Wall Street\" contributions benefiting Clinton have come from a small group of ultra-wealthy, liberal donors who work in finance, rather than from the broader Wall Street industry. In contrast, the corresponding figures for Trump and super PACs backing him are significantly lower, with Trump often claiming to be self-funding his campaign."}
