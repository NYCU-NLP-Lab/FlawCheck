{"The absence of a transcript": "One aspect used to verify the authenticity of the claim was the lack of a transcript of the alleged conversation between Donald Trump and Sarah Sanders. Without any documented evidence, it becomes difficult to confirm the veracity of the claim.", "Media reports and book excerpts": "Another aspect employed was the reliance on media outlets and excerpts from Sarah Sanders' book. Multiple reputable sources, including Fox News, The New York Times, The Guardian, and National Public Radio, reported on sections of Sanders' book where she described the encounter with Kim Jong-un. These reports provided some evidence to support the claim.", "Corroboration of events": "The fact that multiple media outlets reported on the same event, citing Sanders' book, adds an element of corroboration. When different sources independently report on a specific incident, it lends credibility to the claim and increases the likelihood of its authenticity.", "Sarah Sanders": "credibility: The credibility of Sarah Sanders herself was also taken into account. As the former White House Press Secretary, she held a position of authority and responsibility. Her reputation and credibility as a public figure were considered when evaluating the authenticity of her claims."}
