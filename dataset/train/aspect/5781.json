{"The claim is supported by Rep": "Kionne McGhee, the bill's sponsor, who referred to a mural in the House chamber that depicts a slave woman holding a bushel of cotton near Andrew Jackson, suggesting the presence of slaves during the construction of the Old Capitol.", "The claim is also supported by the informational pamphlet compiled by Museum of Florida History staff": "which states that the Old Capitol was \"built in part\" by enslaved people.", "History experts acknowledge the large role slaves played in Florida at the time and suggest it is very likely that enslaved people helped build the Old Capitol": "despite limited documentation.", "The Florida Capitol Complex": "which includes the Old Capitol, was completed in 1845, just before Florida was admitted as the 27th state, further supporting the claim that slaves were involved in its construction."}
