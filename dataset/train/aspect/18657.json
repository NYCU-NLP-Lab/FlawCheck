{"Lack of corroborating information": "The expert's verdict mentions that there is no supporting evidence or information regarding the claim of Marilyn Monroe's intelligence quotient being measured at 168. The absence of details such as the year she was tested, the type of IQ test used, or the reason for taking the test raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Early appearance of the rumor": "The earliest iteration of the rumor was found in a BuzzFeed list published on 5 August 2013. However, no citation was provided for its origin, suggesting that subsequent rumors may have been based on this initial claim.", "Chronological analysis": "The expert's verdict highlights the timeline of IQ testing and Monroe's life. It mentions that Monroe was in her twenties when modern IQ testing was introduced in 1949, and a version for adults was introduced in 1955 when she was nearly 30. This information suggests that it is unlikely she underwent IQ testing during an era when such tests were uncommon.", "Lack of supporting circumstances": "The expert's verdict also considers Monroe's early life, which was marked by instability and foster care. Given her tumultuous upbringing and early marriage, it seems unlikely that intelligence testing would have been a part of her environment during that time. This lack of supporting circumstances further questions the credibility of the claim."}
