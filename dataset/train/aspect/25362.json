{"Superdelegates were introduced in 1984 as a way to ensure that party activists who wanted to be delegates to the convention didn": "t have to compete against well-known and established individuals at the district level.", "Superdelegates make up about one": "third of the total delegates needed to secure the nomination, or about 15 percent of the total delegates. Unlike pledged delegates who vote for the candidate they were elected on behalf of, superdelegates can vote for whomever they want at the convention.", "Superdelegates have never been a determining factor in selecting the Democratic nominee since their introduction in 1984": "While they did play a role in the nomination of former Vice President Walter Mondale in 1984, experts are conflicted about the extent of their power.", "The purpose of superdelegates is to prevent the Democratic party from suffering losses like those experienced with George McGovern in 1972 and Jimmy Carter in 1980": "The party hoped that the inclusion of superdelegates would result in candidates more likely to win general elections, although the system didn't guarantee the desired outcome in 1984 when Mondale lost to Ronald Reagan."}
