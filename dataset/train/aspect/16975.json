{"Expert testimony": "The expert, Eric Toder, co-director of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, stated that the claim is \"exaggerated and misleading\" in a phone interview with AFP. This expert opinion adds credibility to the argument against the claim.", "Reference to the Democratic Platform": "The expert points out that the claim is not supported by the Democratic Platform. Specifically, Page 78 of the platform deals with veterans, military, and transnational issues, not retirement savings. This reference provides evidence that contradicts the claim.", "Biden campaign website": "The expert highlights that a similar pledge to reform the tax code, including retirement contributions, appears on the Biden campaign website. This reinforces the fact that the claim is misleading, as it does not specifically mention taxing 401(k)s.", "Impact on tax deductions and credits": "The expert explains that while the Biden plan would end tax deductions for retirement contributions, it would replace them with a tax credit. The analysis shows that the tax credit would be 26 percent of an individual's contribution. The expert further explains how this change in tax policy would affect individuals in different income brackets, with some potentially seeing a tax increase while others may still benefit from 401(k) contributions. This information provides a detailed examination of the potential impact of the claim."}
