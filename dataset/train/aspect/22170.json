{"The New York Supreme Court ordered President Donald J": "Trump to pay $2 million in damages for improperly using charitable assets to further his own political interests, confirming that there were legal consequences related to the Trump family's involvement with charities.", "The settlement required mandatory training for the three elder Trump children and imposed restrictions on Donald J": "Trump should he join another charity as a director, indicating that measures were put in place to address the issue.", "Any charity for which Trump serves as a director must have a majority of independent directors": "engage counsel with expertise in New York not-for-profit law, and use the services of an accounting firm to monitor and audit the organization's grants and expenses, demonstrating the implementation of strict requirements to prevent misuse of funds.", "The settlement includes a": "total ban on any self-dealing,\" indicating that measures were taken to prevent Trump from using foundation money for personal, business, and political interests. However, the settlement does not ban the Trump family from operating a charity in New York, contradicting the claim made in the Facebook post."}
