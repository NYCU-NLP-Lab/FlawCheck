{"Video evidence": "The expert mentions that AFP recorded a video of the polka-dot zebra foal in the Maasai Mara, which adds credibility to the claim of its existence.", "Social media posts": "The expert highlights several social media posts, including tweets and Facebook posts, that circulated the claim about the zebra being sold abroad. These posts serve as evidence of the claim's widespread dissemination.", "Image analysis": "The expert mentions conducting a Google reverse image search to find the original source of the images associated with the claim. Although this did not provide any leads, it demonstrates an effort to verify the authenticity of the images.", "Confirmation from a veterinary clinic": "The expert mentions finding a Facebook post by a veterinary clinic in South Africa, which included images similar to those circulating with the claim. The clinic owner, Dr. Clifford Bull, confirmed that the images were of a different zebra and not related to the Kenyan polka-dot zebra. This confirmation from a reputable source adds credibility to the debunking of the claim."}
