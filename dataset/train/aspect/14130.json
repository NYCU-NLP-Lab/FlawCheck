{"National survey by the U": "S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: The expert refers to a national survey conducted by the CDC, which states that one in four women and one in seven men have experienced severe physical violence by an intimate partner. This information is used to provide context and question the claim of a 67 percent decrease in domestic violence cases.", "Letter signed by U": "S. Rep. Gwen Moore and 119 other members of Congress: The expert mentions a letter signed by Rep. Gwen Moore and other members of Congress, which calls for the re-authorization of the Violence Against Women Act. The letter claims that since the federal law was adopted in 1994, \"cases of domestic violence have fallen by 67 percent.\" This letter is used as evidence to support the claim.", "Use of the 67 percent decrease claim by various sources": "The expert mentions that the claim of a 67 percent decrease in domestic violence cases was also made by the White House, MoveOn.org, and a U.S. Justice Department official in testimony to Congress. This highlights the widespread use of the claim and suggests that it may have some validity.", "Department of Justice reports on nonfatal victimizations": "The expert refers to two Department of Justice reports, one from September 2011 and another from November 2012. The more recent report states that from 1994 to 2010, the rate of nonfatal intimate partner violence in the U.S. declined by 64 percent. This report provides empirical evidence to support the claim of a decrease in domestic violence cases."}
