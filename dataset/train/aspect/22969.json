The House Energy and Commerce Committee passed an amendment that sought to make abortion coverage available in both the public plan and in private plans participating in the exchange, but paid exclusively through patient premiums, not government subsidies.", "The amendment provided": "conscience protections\" so that any insurance plan participating in the exchange could not discriminate against hospitals or other health care facilities unwilling to provide abortions.", "The health care bill passed by the House included an abortion amendment that essentially rendered the claim about": "free abortion services\" moot."}
