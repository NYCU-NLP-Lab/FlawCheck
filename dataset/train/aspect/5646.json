{"Lack of credible sources": "The expert noted that the claim originated from a post on the website \"Tyrone Tribulations,\" which is not a reputable or reliable source of news. This lack of credible sources raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Unrealistic and humorous details": "The story itself contains several ridiculous and humorous details, such as the use of spoons and a tunnel boring machine to dig the tunnel. These details indicate that the claim is more likely a work of fiction or satire rather than a true event.", "Admission by viral web sites": "The expert mentioned that popular viral web sites like Boing Boing and BuzzFeed were initially fooled by the story but later admitted that they had been deceived. This admission by reputable sites further undermines the credibility of the claim.", "Lack of acknowledgment as satire": "Although the original post on \"Tyrone Tribulations\" did not explicitly label the story as satire, it contained enough absurd elements to suggest that it was a fictional piece. The fact that the wife in the story shrugged off the sewage odor from her husband also adds to the satirical nature of the claim."}
