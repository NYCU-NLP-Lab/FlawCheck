{"Lack of evidence": "The expert's verdict highlights that there is no evidence to support the claim that ISIS is crossing the U.S.-Mexico border. This lack of evidence undermines the authenticity of the claim.", "Previous unfounded claims": "The expert mentions that other Arizona officials, such as Congressman Trent Franks, have previously made similar claims about ISIS being present in Mexico. However, these claims were found to be unfounded and lacking any confirmation from law enforcement officials.", "Disputed by multiple officials": "The expert's verdict mentions that multiple officials, including Arizona Department of Public Safety spokesman Damon Cecil, have disputed the claim. They state that while individuals from Middle Eastern countries have been detained near the border, there is no evidence linking them to ISIS or any other terrorist organization.", "Influx of immigrants from the Middle East": "The expert's verdict also mentions that there has been an influx of immigrants from the Middle East using the U.S.-Mexico border, but this has been a long-standing issue and does not necessarily indicate the presence of ISIS specifically. This aspect highlights the need for careful analysis and verification before making claims about specific terrorist groups crossing the border."}
