{"Comparison of oil rigs in the United States and the rest of the world": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim made by U.S. Rep. David Cicilline is about there being more oil rigs in operation in the United States than the rest of the world combined. To verify the authenticity of this claim, the expert compares the number of oil and gas drilling rigs in the United States (1,835) to the number in other countries (1,615) according to data from Baker Hughes, an oilfield services company.", "Exclusion of rigs in Russia and China": "The expert notes that the Baker Hughes data used for comparison does not include rigs drilling in Russia or onshore China due to difficulties in obtaining those statistics. However, Richard Mason from Hart Energy Digital mentioned that 18 months ago, Russia had more than 1,000 active rigs, and Kurt Abraham from World Oil cited a report showing more than 1,000 land rigs in China. This aspect highlights the limitations of the data used and suggests that the actual numbers may be higher.", "Lack of a definitive source": "The expert mentions that the Cicilline campaign referred to a blog entry on the White House website as the source of the factoid, but it did not provide a specific source or offer any numbers. This aspect emphasizes the lack of a reliable and verifiable source for the claim, raising doubts about its accuracy.", "Incomplete information": "The expert highlights that the Baker Hughes data used for comparison is from October 12, 2012, which means it may not reflect the current situation accurately. This aspect indicates that the information used to verify the claim is outdated and may not provide a comprehensive picture of the current number of oil rigs in operation worldwide."}
