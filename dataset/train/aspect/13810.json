{"Lack of recent headlines": "The expert points out that there have been no recent headlines about 70 percent support for Act 10, despite statewide polls typically receiving widespread news coverage. This suggests that there may be a lack of evidence to support the claim.", "Recall election": "The expert mentions that Governor Scott Walker faced a recall election in June 2012 due to the reaction to Act 10. This highlights the significance of the law and its impact on public opinion, but it does not directly verify the claim of 70 percent approval.", "Radio interview": "The expert refers to a radio interview where Governor Walker made the claim about the poll results. This provides a specific context in which the claim was made, but it does not directly verify the authenticity of the poll or its findings.", "Marquette Law School poll": "The expert mentions a statewide poll conducted by the Marquette Law School, which showed a decline in Governor Walker's approval rating. While this poll is not directly related to the claim of 70 percent approval for Act 10, it provides additional information about public opinion and can be used as a reference point for evaluating the claim."}
