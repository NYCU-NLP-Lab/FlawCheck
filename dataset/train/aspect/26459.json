{"The claim originated from a post on social media site Parler": "which was spread by pro-Trump attorney Lin Wood. However, Wood's Twitter account had been suspended, raising questions about the credibility of the claim.", "The claim also appeared on video hosting site Bitchute": "which further propagated its reach. The presence of the claim on multiple platforms adds to its visibility but does not necessarily verify its authenticity.", "The video clip circulating online does not explicitly show someone admitting to being Antifa or claiming that its members broke into the Capitol": "The individual in the video refers to involvement by Trump supporters, not Antifa.", "The person featured in the video": "identified as hair stylist Kristopher Drew, denies being Antifa and states that the original video was edited by others. He clarifies that he did not enter the Capitol building and refers to the use of \"we\" as a collective term for the group of people involved."}
