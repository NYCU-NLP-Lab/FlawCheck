{"Lack of credible news reports": "The expert's verdict states that no real news outlet has reported any federal investigations or imminent indictments of the Obama Foundation by the U.S. Department of Justice. This suggests that the claim lacks authenticity as it is not supported by reputable sources.", "Source credibility": "The claim originated solely from the Patriot Post, which is identified as a fake news site that deals in political clickbait trolling and labels itself as \"satire.\" The expert's verdict highlights the lack of credibility of the source, further questioning the authenticity of the claim.", "Satirical nature of the source": "The expert's verdict emphasizes that the Patriot Post is a site of conservative satire, where everything is fictional. This indicates that the claim should not be taken seriously as it is not based on real events or facts.", "Lack of evidence and contradictory information": "The expert's verdict mentions that the greatest controversy associated with the Obama Foundation is the location of a parking garage on the Obama Presidential Center campus. This contradicts the claim of the foundation being investigated for racketeering, as there is no evidence or information to support such allegations."}
