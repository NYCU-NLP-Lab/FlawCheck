{"The CDC": "s denial of combining pneumonia and flu deaths with COVID-19 deaths: NCHS Chief of Mortality Statistics Bob Anderson explicitly stated that the CDC does not combine pneumonia deaths with COVID-19 deaths. He clarified that deaths caused by pneumonia developed due to COVID-19 are noted separately on death certificates and are only counted once as COVID-19 deaths.", "Possibility of patients having both COVID": "19 and influenza: While it is possible for patients to have both COVID-19 and influenza simultaneously, influenza is often not reported on death certificates. This indicates that the claim of combining influenza deaths with COVID-19 deaths is not accurate.", "Confirmation of false claim by NCHS": "Brian Tsai, public affairs specialist at NCHS, confirmed that the claim is false. He referred to provisional data on COVID-19 death counts, which are broken down to account for deaths from COVID-19 with or without influenza or pneumonia.", "Reasons for including pneumonia and influenza deaths in provisional totals": "The CDC includes pneumonia and influenza deaths in the provisional totals because these diseases can cause similar symptoms to COVID-19. Tracking all three indicators helps assess the completeness of COVID-19 death data. The CDC acknowledges that deaths due to COVID-19 may be misclassified as pneumonia or influenza deaths in the absence of positive test results."}
