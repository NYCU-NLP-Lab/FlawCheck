{"Louis XIV": "s interest in watching women give birth: The expert's verdict confirms that Louis XIV did have an interest in witnessing the birthing process and was likely present in the room when his wife gave birth.", "Influence of Fran\u00e7ois Mariceau": "The expert's verdict states that it was Fran\u00e7ois Mariceau, a renowned French doctor, who is generally credited with the practice of having women lie flat on their backs during birth. Louis XIV did not require or inspire this practice.", "Historical birthing positions": "The expert's verdict explains that before the dorsal and lithotomy positions became the norm, many cultures had different birthing positions, including sitting, kneeling, squatting, or even standing during labor and delivery. This challenges the claim that Louis XIV required women to give birth lying on their backs.", "Misrepresentation by media outlets": "The expert's verdict highlights that the claim was based on a 1987 review published in the American Journal of Public Health, but media outlets presented the findings out of context and embellished Louis XIV's role in the transition of birthing positions. The claim is largely false and contains kernels of truth that were distorted by the media."}
