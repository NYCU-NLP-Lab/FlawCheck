{"Lack of official crowd size figures": "Law enforcement agencies and official sources, such as the Metropolitan Police Department and the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, did not provide any numbers on the crowd size, making it difficult to verify the claim accurately.", "Varying estimates from unreliable sources": "President Donald Trump and White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany provided inconsistent estimates of the attendance, with Trump mentioning \"tens of thousands\" or \"hundreds of thousands\" of participants, and McEnany tweeting about \"more than one million\" marchers. These varying estimates from unreliable sources add to the challenge of verifying the claim.", "Absence of impartial and authoritative estimate": "Due to the lack of official figures and the unreliable estimates from partisan sources, the claim remains unproven. The absence of an impartial and authoritative estimate makes it harder to determine the authenticity of the claim accurately.", "Limitations of visual evidence": "While photographs and videos can provide some insight into crowd size, they are often unreliable indicators and can be easily manipulated. Therefore, relying solely on visual evidence may not provide a conclusive verification of the claim."}
