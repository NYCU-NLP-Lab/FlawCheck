{"The expert": "s verdict states that economists have found that oil companies do not pass the full benefit of gas tax holidays on to consumers. This aspect verifies the claim that the tax holiday would primarily benefit the oil companies rather than the consumers.", "The expert also mentions that the vast majority of economists": "including 308 who signed a letter, oppose the gas tax holiday. This aspect supports the claim that \"every economist\" does not believe the break would only go to the oil companies.", "The expert acknowledges that even though critics of the gas tax holiday believe consumers would see some benefit": "Obama's statement exaggerates by saying \"every economist\" agrees that the break would only benefit the oil companies. This aspect highlights the extent of the exaggeration made by Obama.", "The expert refers to a study conducted in Illinois in 2000": "which found that three-fifths of the benefit of a state gas tax holiday went to consumers. This aspect suggests that consumers would still receive a significant share of the benefit even with a federal gas tax break, contradicting the claim that all economists believe the benefit would solely go to the oil companies."}
