The widespread coverage and dissemination of the claim indicate its influence and impact on public perception, making it important to verify its accuracy.", "Definition and criticism": "The expert's verdict highlights that Everytown for Gun Safety's definition of \"school shooting\" is relatively broad, including incidents beyond what many people would consider as school shootings.
