{"Analysis of EPA violations": "The experts analyzed 680,000 violations logged over a 10-year period in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s Safe Drinking Water Information System. This analysis helped determine the extent of violations and potential exposure to unsafe drinking water.", "Focus on active community water systems": "The experts specifically examined violations by active community water systems, which supply water to the same population year-round. This focus excluded other types of water systems, such as schools or hospitals, to provide a more accurate assessment of the safety of drinking water for the general population.", "Identification of financial constraints": "The experts found that many local water treatment plants, particularly in poor, minority, and small communities, lacked the funds to purchase the necessary equipment for filtering out contaminants. This aspect highlights the financial challenges faced by certain communities in ensuring safe drinking water.", "Nuances and limitations of the analysis": "The experts acknowledged that the estimate of 60 million Americans exposed to unsafe drinking water was not a direct representation of active and ongoing exposure. The analysis noted that some places had resolved their water issues, and the EPA database might not include all violations or contain some incorrect information. This aspect emphasizes the need to consider the nuances and limitations of the data when evaluating the authenticity of the claim."}
