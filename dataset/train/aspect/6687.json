{"Historical context": "The expert mentions the state of healthcare in the 1940s, highlighting that it was virtually unregulated and health insurance was nonexistent. This provides a background for understanding the claim about the percentage of healthcare costs paid by the patient.", "Evolution of health insurance": "The expert explains the establishment of Blue Cross plans in 1929 and the inclusion of health insurance benefits by employers after World War II. This information helps to support the claim that there has been a significant change in the percentage of healthcare costs paid directly by the patient.", "Reference to a specific report": "The expert refers to a 1971 report titled \"National Health Expenditures, 1929-70\" by Dorothy P. Rice and Barbara S. Cooper. This report provides the data that supports the claim made by Senator Johnson, specifically stating that in 1949, out-of-pocket spending for healthcare was at 67.7 percent.", "Government data": "The expert mentions that figures for healthcare spending from 1960 onwards can be found on the website of The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. This suggests that there is official data available to verify the claim beyond the specific report mentioned earlier."}
