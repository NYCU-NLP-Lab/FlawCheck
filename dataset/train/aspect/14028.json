{"Religious affiliation is a secondary issue": "The expert's verdict highlights that religious affiliation is not the primary cause of the conflict in Nigeria. Instead, it is primarily a dispute over natural resources and land usage. This aspect challenges the claim's focus on Muslim militants targeting Christians.", "Failure to explain the complexity of the conflict": "The expert criticizes the reports in the U.S. for not properly explaining the complexity of the Nigerian conflict. This suggests that the claim may have oversimplified the situation by attributing the violence solely to Muslim militants targeting Christians.", "Mention of a major reported atrocity against the Fula people": "The expert points out that Breitbart's article failed to mention a major reported atrocity perpetrated against the mostly Muslim Fula people in February 2019. This aspect raises doubts about the claim's accuracy and impartiality.", "Corroboration of attacks by local news reports": "While not entirely reliable, the expert acknowledges that local news reports largely corroborate the incidents and deaths described in the claim. This aspect suggests that there is some evidence supporting the claim, although its reliability may be questionable."}
