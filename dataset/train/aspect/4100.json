{"The image of the falling octopus was found to be a hoax": "as it was created by editing a stock image of an octopus onto a rainy background scene.", "The claim originated from a photograph shared on the social networking site Weibo": "which then spread to Western news outlets such as the New York Post, Maxim, and the Daily Mail.", "While Qingdao did experience strong winds on the reported date": "multiple social media users posted photographs of sea creatures landing on their car windshields, suggesting the possibility of animals being displaced during the storm.", "However": "the underlying rumor of animals falling from the sky is not completely far-fetched, as hurricanes and tornadoes have been known to displace small animals in the past. In this specific case, it was suggested that seafood may have been blown from nearby stalls at a market into the road, creating the illusion of sea creatures falling from the sky."}
