{"The claim states that a deer became": "riddled with tumors from eating plants sprayed with Monsanto\u2019s Roundup.\" However, the expert's verdict confirms that the hairless protrusions on the deer are actually Cutaneous fibromas, commonly referred to as deer warts, which are caused by a viral infection transmitted through biting insects or direct contact with damaged skin. This aspect verifies that the claim is not accurate in attributing the tumors to Roundup.", "The expert": "s verdict also mentions that while fibromas may not typically be harmful to deer, heavy tumor loads can lead to exhaustion and incapacitation due to interference with vision, respiration, food ingestion, and locomotion. Additionally, the fibromas can occasionally create a bacterial infection. This aspect provides additional context about the impact of fibromas on deer, highlighting the potential harm caused by extensive tumor loads and bacterial infections, but does not support the claim's association with Roundup."}
