{"The claim was verified by referencing a report published by the Government Accountability Office": "GAO), which is a respected and nonpartisan investigative arm of Congress. The GAO report is mandated by law and identifies programs, offices, and practices in the government that could be eliminated or changed due to duplication or lack of value for taxpayers.", "The Ossoff campaign provided a list of specific line items from the GAO report that they believe can be eliminated to achieve savings": "These line items include consolidating federal data centers, implementing \"strategic sourcing\" at the Defense Department, expanding joint basing at the Defense Department, and improving spending oversight at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.", "The total savings estimated from the identified line items in the GAO report amount to almost exactly": "16 billion, which aligns with the claim made by Jon Ossoff.", "It is important to note that not all the recommendations in the GAO report are strictly duplicative": "Some recommendations focus on improving oversight or management. Additionally, the $16 billion figure does not encompass all the recommendations in the GAO report or those specifically related to duplicative programs identified by the GAO."}
