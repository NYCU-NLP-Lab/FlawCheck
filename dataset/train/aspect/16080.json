{"Confirmation from O": "Rourke's spokesman: O'Rourke's spokesman, Chris Evans, categorically denied that O'Rourke made the statement in question. He stated that the quote was fabricated, providing a direct contradiction to the claim.", "O": "Rourke's record on veterans' issues: The expert highlighted O'Rourke's position as a member of the House Veteran Affairs Committee and his work as the congressional representative for the military community of El Paso. This information supports the assertion that O'Rourke has been actively involved in advocating for veterans' rights, contradicting the claim that he would dismiss wounded veterans.", "Lack of corroborating sources": "The expert conducted an online search but found no sources that could corroborate the claim that O'Rourke made the statement about throwing veterans and the elderly in the garbage. This lack of evidence further weakens the credibility of the claim.", "Legislative accomplishments related to veterans": "The expert cited O'Rourke's sponsorship of several bills related to veterans, including the Get Veterans a Better Doctor Now Act and the Enhanced Veteran Healthcare Act of 2017. The fact that O'Rourke actively supported and saw these bills signed into law contradicts the claim that he would disregard the well-being of veterans."}
