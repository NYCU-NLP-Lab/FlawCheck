{"Testimony from Richard Branson": "The expert's verdict mentions that Richard Branson published a blog entry describing his two-hour lunch meeting with Donald Trump in the 1990s. Branson stated that during the lunch, Trump spoke exclusively about his plans to \"destroy\" five people who had declined to help him. This firsthand testimony from Branson adds authenticity to the claim.", "Recirculation of the meme": "The controversy surrounding the firing of Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman and Ambassador Gordon Sondland prompted the recirculation of a meme quoting Richard Branson's claim about Trump's lunch conversation. The fact that the meme resurfaced during a relevant political event strengthens the claim's authenticity.", "Timing of the claim": "The claim states that Richard Branson had this lunch conversation with Donald Trump years ago. The fact that Branson published his account of the lunch before the 2016 U.S. presidential election adds credibility to the claim, as it predates any political motivations or biases.", "Concerns about Trump": "s vindictive streak: In Branson's blog entry, he expressed his concerns about Trump's vindictive nature and how it could be dangerous if he became the President. This aspect adds further weight to the authenticity of the claim, as it aligns with the expert's verdict and provides insight into Trump's character."}
