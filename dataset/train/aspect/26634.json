{"Lack of original source": "The expert found that despite the widespread sharing of the photograph, they were unable to trace it back to the original source. They searched for the image on the event page where it was claimed to be taken but found no other posts by the person whose name was displayed on the photograph. This raises questions about the authenticity of the claim.", "Inconsistencies in other photographs": "The expert discovered another photograph taken by \"Julie N.\" at the same rally in Denver, where the children in question were present. However, in that photo, their shirts were obscured, and it was clear that they were not wearing the \"Fuck Trump\" shirts depicted in the controversial photograph. This inconsistency suggests that the claim may not be accurate.", "Presence of similar shirts at the event": "The expert found several images of other protesters at the same rally wearing the same \"Fuck Trump\" shirts. One image even showed a pile of these shirts at the rally site. While it is not clear if the shirts were being sold or distributed, it is plausible that children could have obtained similar shirts at some point during the event. This supports the possibility that the children may have briefly worn anti-Trump attire, although it does not confirm the specific claim about the photograph in question.", "Historical precedent": "The expert points out that vulgar protest shirts and children being brought to political events are not uncommon occurrences. They reference past instances of children wearing provocative shirts at rallies, suggesting that the claim of children wearing \"Fuck Trump\" shirts is not out of the realm of possibility. However, this historical precedent does not directly verify the authenticity of the specific claim being analyzed."}
