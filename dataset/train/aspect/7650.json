{"Testimony from an experienced exterminator": "The expert contacted David Ohnefloss, an exterminator with 30 years of experience, who stated that he has never seen a brown recluse infestation that he believes came from delivery boxes. He also mentioned that the infestation was likely concentrated around an artificial Christmas tree, not the delivery boxes.", "Lack of native habitat": "Brown recluse spiders are not native to northern Kentucky, where the exterminator lives. This suggests that the spiders did not come from the delivery boxes, but rather from another source.", "Cautionary message": "The purpose of the original social media post was to urge people to open newly arrived boxes outside, if possible, and be aware of what could be inside. The expert emphasized the importance of being cautious without panicking about internet rumors.", "Expert opinion": "The expert consulted with Rick Vetter, a retired research associate in entomology, who agreed that while it is not impossible for a spider to end up in a delivery box, the likelihood of it happening is low. This expert opinion supports the notion that the claim of brown recluse spiders infesting homes through delivery boxes is unlikely."}
