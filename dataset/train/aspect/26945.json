{"Calculation of agents per square mile": "The expert calculated the number of Border Patrol agents per square mile in Arizona by dividing the total number of agents (4,795) by the total square miles of the state (113,998). This calculation provided the accurate number of agents per square mile, which was found to be 0.4 agents per every 10 square miles.", "Comparison of square miles vs": "linear miles: The expert highlighted the difference between square miles and linear miles when assessing the number of agents deployed along the Arizona-Mexico border. They explained that most agents are concentrated in the southern regions closer to the border, making the total square miles of the state irrelevant in this context.", "Agent deployment based on threat assessment": "The expert mentioned that Border Patrol agents are strategically deployed based on the threat of criminal activity. This indicates that the number of agents in different areas along the border may vary depending on the patterns of activity and the level of risk.", "Variation in agent density per linear mile": "The expert provided data on the number of Border Patrol agents per linear mile in two sectors of Arizona (Tucson and Yuma). They found that the Tucson sector had over 15 agents per mile, while the Yuma sector had over six agents per mile. This demonstrates that the density of agents can differ significantly depending on the specific sector and its characteristics."}
