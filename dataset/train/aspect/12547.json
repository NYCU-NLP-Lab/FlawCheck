{"The analysis by the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation": "which stated that 80 percent of the cuts in the House version of the tax bill would go to corporations, businesses, and wealthy families.", "Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin": "s explanation that the numbers are complicated and depend on how they are allocated, suggesting that the pass-through allocation and corporate tax cuts benefit small and medium-sized businesses and the wealthy.", "Analysis by the Tax Foundation": "an independent conservative-leaning group, which showed that middle-income Americans would benefit from the tax bills, with every income group except one seeing an increase in after-tax income.", "The acknowledgment that Mnuchin": "s claim about \"rich people\" receiving very little cuts or increases is questionable and based on a selective reading of the data, as the bills would also impact personal income taxes as well as other aspects of the tax system."}
