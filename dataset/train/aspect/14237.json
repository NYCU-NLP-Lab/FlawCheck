{"Verification of authorship": "The experts checked the authenticity of the claim by examining the attribution of the quote to William Shakespeare. They consulted the Folger Shakespeare Library, which houses the largest collection of materials related to Shakespeare, and confirmed that the quote does not exist in their collection.", "Linguistic analysis": "The experts analyzed the language and cadence of the quote to determine if it aligns with Shakespeare's writing style. They concluded that the quote does not match Shakespeare's language and is not written in early modern English.", "Comparison with known works": "The experts compared the quote to Shakespeare's known works, such as his plays and poems, to see if any phrases or ideas from the quote appeared in his writings. They found no similarities, further supporting the conclusion that the quote is not by Shakespeare.", "Identification of alternative source": "The experts identified that the last part of the quote was lifted from a poem by William Arthur Ward, a 20th-century writer. This finding suggests that the quote is a misattribution and not an original work by Shakespeare."}
