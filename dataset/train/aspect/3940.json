{"The claim made by Larry Krasner": "s campaign was that he is the only candidate running for District Attorney who explicitly pledges to never seek the death penalty.", "The expert reached out to every candidate for district attorney": "including six other Democrats and one Republican, to ask for clarification on their stance on the death penalty and whether they support Governor Tom Wolf's death penalty moratorium.", "Beth Grossman": "the Republican candidate, did not respond directly but previously stated that she supports the death penalty in certain cases.", "Each of the Democratic candidates": "Michael Untermeyer, Joe Khan, Jack O'Neill, Teresa Carr-Deni, and Rich Negrin, had varying stances on the death penalty. Untermeyer doesn't personally support it but wouldn't rule it out in extreme circumstances, Khan would only seek it in the most extreme circumstances while a moratorium is in place, O'Neill wouldn't rule it out in the most heinous circumstances, Carr-Deni would only seek it in extreme or heinous circumstances, and Negrin did not respond but previously stated during a forum that he would not seek the death penalty if elected."}
