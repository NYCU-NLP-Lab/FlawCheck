{"Comparison of dates": "The expert compared the date of the Facebook post claiming to show photos of Typhoon Hagibis in Japan (October 11, 2019) with the actual date of the typhoon making landfall (October 12, 2019). This comparison helped to establish that the claim was made before the typhoon occurred, indicating that it was likely false.", "Reverse image search": "The expert conducted a reverse image search on Google, which led to the discovery that the same photo used in the Facebook post was actually published in a Washington Post report on August 26, 2019. This verification method helped to confirm that the photo was not related to Typhoon Hagibis in Japan.", "Location analysis": "The expert mentioned that the photo in question was credited to Don Burdick and was taken in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware. By providing this information and including a screenshot of the photo, the expert established that the photo was not taken in Okinawa, Japan as claimed in the Facebook post. This analysis helped to discredit the authenticity of the claim.", "Weather data analysis": "The expert referenced an analysis using Wolfram Alpha, an online weather data tool, which showed that the weather in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, on August 19, 2019 (the date the photo was taken), was partly cloudy with scattered showers. This analysis supported the information provided in the Washington Post report and further undermined the claim that the photo was related to Typhoon Hagibis in Japan."}
