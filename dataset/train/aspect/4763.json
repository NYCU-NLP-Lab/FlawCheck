{"The data presented in the Twitter thread are not real": "time observations of sulfur concentrations above Wuhan, but rather computer-model outputs based on historical knowledge and current atmospheric conditions.", "Sulfur dioxide emissions are not a significant byproduct of human cremation": "but rather result from the burning of coal in power plants and industrial activities like iron and steel production.", "The source of the data highlighted in the Twitter thread is Windy": "com, a weather conditions mapping platform primarily used by outdoor sports enthusiasts, which obtains its sulfur data from a NASA climate model called GEOS-5.", "The GEOS": "5 sulfur dioxide models used by Windy.com do not assimilate real satellite data and rely on fixed emission inventories, which cannot account for day-to-day variations in emissions or sudden changes in human activity. The higher emission inventories prescribed for the Wuhan region are likely due to the presence of the Wuhan Iron & Steel Company."}
