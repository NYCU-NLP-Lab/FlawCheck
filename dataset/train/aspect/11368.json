{"The expert": "s verdict states that Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg inaccurately claimed that \"we could lose half the world's oxygen because of what's going on in the oceans.\" This claim is deemed a misreading of the evidence by scientists.", "The expert explains that while climate change does pose a threat to oceans and can reduce the amount of dissolved oxygen": "globally, oceans are projected to lose only 1%-7% of their oxygen. Therefore, the world's atmospheric oxygen supply is not at risk.", "The expert highlights that the Buttigieg campaign referred to an online news story in Smithsonian Insider and a 2018 paper in the journal Science to support the claim": "However, a postdoctoral researcher and biological oceanographer stated that the fact that \"approximately half\" of the oxygen on Earth comes from the ocean does not relate to the deoxygenation problem or imply the potential loss of half the world's oxygen.", "The expert emphasizes that even with significant incineration of living organisms": "the oxygen concentration in the air would hardly decrease. The Earth's atmosphere is approximately 21% oxygen, and climate change will not noticeably reduce this percentage."}
