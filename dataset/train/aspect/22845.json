{"The source of the claim": "The expert verified that the claim was made by Rep. John Yarmuth, a Democrat from Kentucky, during a House floor speech on March 16, 2010. The expert also confirmed that Yarmuth's office provided information about the poll they were referring to, which was conducted for McClatchy newspapers by Ipsos Public Affairs.", "Credibility of the poll": "The expert determined that Ipsos Public Affairs is a credible firm that works with various media outlets. The poll in question was conducted between Feb. 26 and Feb. 28, 2010, and involved 1,076 voters. The expert also noted that the poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 points, indicating a reasonable level of accuracy.", "Question asked in the poll": "The expert mentioned that the poll asked voters if they were opposed to the health care reform proposals and whether their opposition was because they believed the current proposals didn't go far enough to reform health care or if they opposed health care reform overall and thought the current proposals went too far. This specific question allowed for distinguishing between those who opposed the bill due to it not going far enough and those who opposed it for other reasons.", "Percentage of respondents": "The expert confirmed that 37 percent of voters in the poll responded that the current proposals \"don't go far enough to reform health care.\" This closely aligned with Yarmuth's statement of \"almost 40 percent,\" indicating that his reference to the poll's findings was accurate."}
