{"The number of lawyers in the U": "S. Senate: The claim states that there are 57 lawyers in the Senate, including Russ Feingold. The expert's verdict confirms that 57 members of the Senate graduated from law school, but it also acknowledges that not all of them practiced law before entering politics.", "Backgrounds of Senators": "The expert's verdict mentions that members of Congress come from various professional backgrounds, including casino dealer, meat cutter, major-league pitcher, riverboat captain, Navy battle group commander, toll booth collector, and coroner. While the claim focuses on lawyers, the expert's verdict suggests that there is a diverse range of professional experiences among Senators.", "Occupation distribution in the Senate": "The expert's verdict refers to a 2008 study by Congressional Quarterly, which showed that law was the top occupation of senators at that time, followed by public service and business. This information provides a broader perspective on the distribution of occupations in the Senate beyond just lawyers.", "Senators with business background": "The expert's verdict mentions that there are senators with business backgrounds, including Herb Kohl from Wisconsin, who presided over the Kohl's grocery and department store chain. It also states that more than 20 senators have at least some business background. This information contradicts the claim's implication that there are zero manufacturers in the Senate."}
