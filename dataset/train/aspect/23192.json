{"Satellite observations": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim was verified using satellite observations. The National Snow & Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado, Boulder, and NASA both provided data indicating that in July 2012, an estimated 97% of the ice sheet surface had thawed.", "Analysis by a senior scientist": "Dorothy Hall, a senior scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, examined the event and her findings are set to be published in Geophysical Research Letters. Her analysis contributes to verifying the authenticity of the claim.", "Unusual weather event": "The expert's verdict mentions that a very unusual weather event occurred in July 2012, which contributed to the intense melting of Greenland's surface ice cover. This aspect further supports the claim's authenticity.", "Surface melting": "The expert's verdict emphasizes that the melting observed by satellites was primarily at and near the surface, often to a depth of no more than an inch. It clarifies that the ice sheet itself did not thaw or come close to thawing. This distinction highlights the extent and nature of the melting, reinforcing the claim's validity."}
