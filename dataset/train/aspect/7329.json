{"Lack of evidence": "The Pennsylvania Department of State stated that there is no evidence of fraud or illegality in the 2020 election, which contradicts Giuliani's claim of \"600,000 plus unlawful votes in Philly and Pitt.\" This lack of evidence undermines the authenticity of the claim.", "Absence of explanation": "Giuliani provided no explanation for how such a large number of votes could have been cast unlawfully. This lack of explanation raises doubts about the validity of the claim.", "Presence of observers": "Observers from both parties were present during the vote counts, and no court has agreed with complaints that Republican observers were denied access. This suggests that the voting process was transparent and further discredits the claim of unlawful votes.", "Rejection by election officials": "The Pennsylvania Department of State, responsible for overseeing elections, stated that Giuliani's claim is unfounded and provided no rationale or explanation for the alleged fraudulent votes. The agency's communications director explicitly dismissed the claim, stating that there is no factual basis for it. This rejection by election officials undermines the credibility of the claim."}
