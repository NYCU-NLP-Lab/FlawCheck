{"Overstatement of cost": "The expert's verdict states that state Sen. LaTonya Johnson overstates the amount of cost that is due to bad road conditions. This suggests that the claim may not accurately reflect the true cost per driver in Milwaukee.", "Poor road conditions": "The expert's verdict mentions that several studies have rated the road conditions in Milwaukee and the state poorly. This indicates that there is evidence supporting the claim that road conditions are a problem in the area.", "Additional factors contributing to cost": "The expert's verdict highlights that the total cost per driver includes more than just costs directly tied to road conditions. This suggests that the claim may not solely represent the impact of road conditions on the cost to drivers.", "Similar findings from other sources": "The expert's verdict mentions that other entities, such as Teletrac Navman and the American Society of Civil Engineers, have also found costs associated with road conditions in Milwaukee. This adds credibility to the claim, although the specific cost per driver may vary."}
