The ADA is said to be modeled after these existing laws, which also aim to prevent discrimination based on various factors such as race, color, religion, sex, national origin, and disabilities.", "The historical context provided": "including the mention of the late 1800s and the enactment of \"unsightly beggar ordinances\" or \"ugly laws,\" serves as evidence for the claim. The description of these laws being passed in American cities to remove individuals considered \"diseased, maimed, mutilated, or in any way deformed\" from public spaces supports the authenticity of the claim.", "The specific examples of cities like San Francisco": "Omaha, Columbus, Cleveland, and Portland enacting similar laws using almost identical language further strengthen the claim's authenticity. The mention of these cities following the example set by San Francisco in 1867 provides specific evidence of the existence of such laws targeting individuals with physical deformities or disabilities."}
