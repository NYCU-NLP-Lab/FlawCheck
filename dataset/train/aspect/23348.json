{"The claim made by the Economic Freedom Fighters": "EFF) that the deaths of 10 South African children from Covid-19 disproved the theory that young people are less susceptible to the virus.", "The acknowledgement by experts that while children can contract the virus": "they generally experience less severe symptoms, but some children with comorbidities may be at higher risk of death.", "The evidence provided by incidence rates": "which show significantly fewer infections in children compared to adults, especially those under the age of 10.", "The breakdown of Covid": "related deaths by age group, indicating that children accounted for only 0.4% of all deaths in South Africa, suggesting that the claim's emphasis on the deaths of 10 children does not accurately represent the overall risk of contracting the virus for the population."}
