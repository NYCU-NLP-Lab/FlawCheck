{"The claim contradicts accepted medical knowledge": "The expert's verdict highlights that the advice of using flour to treat burns goes against all accepted knowledge about burn treatment. This aspect questions the authenticity of the claim.", "Personal anecdotal evidence": "The expert mentions a personal anecdote about someone using flour to treat burns in Vietnam. While this may seem persuasive, it is important to consider that personal anecdotes do not necessarily provide scientific evidence or guarantee the effectiveness of a treatment.", "Lack of scientific evidence or research": "The expert's verdict does not provide any scientific studies or research to support the claim that flour is an effective treatment for burns. This absence of empirical evidence raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Contradiction with established burn treatment guidelines": "The expert emphasizes the recommended actions for treating burns, which involve cooling the burned area with cool water or gently running water for a minimum of five minutes. This contradicts the claim's suggestion of using flour without any cooling process. The contradiction with established burn treatment guidelines adds further skepticism to the claim's authenticity."}
