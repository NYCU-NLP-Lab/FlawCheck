{"Emergency rulings by the Supreme Court": "The expert's verdict highlights that the claim lacks important context regarding emergency rulings on mail-in voting delivered by the Supreme Court on October 26 and 29. These rulings blocked ballot deadline extension in Wisconsin but allowed it in North Carolina and Pennsylvania.", "Local authorities": "requests for extended deadlines: In all three cases mentioned, local authorities had requested that ballots be counted when received up to three days (Pennsylvania), six days (Wisconsin), or nine days (North Carolina) after Election Day. This indicates that there were efforts to accommodate ballots received after November 3.", "Potential review and reversal of rulings": "The expert's verdict mentions that the rulings could be subject to further review and potential reversal by Election Day. This implies that the rules regarding the counting of mail-in ballots received after November 3 may change based on future legal proceedings.", "Existence of states that count ballots received after November 3": "The expert's verdict notes that as of October 31, there were 22 states that count ballots received at least one day after November 3, with some accepting ballots as late as November 23. This demonstrates that there are states with provisions in place to consider mail-in ballots received after the election day."}
