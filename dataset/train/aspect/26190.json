{"Lack of media reports": "The expert mentions that they did not find any media reports corroborating the viral claim of the 'nationality' column being removed from Indian passports. This suggests that there is no credible news source supporting the claim.", "Verification through official sources": "The expert searched the Ministry of External Affairs official Passport Seva Portal and failed to find any information about the removal of the 'nationality' column. They also found a copy of a passport issued in October 2020, which still had the 'nationality' column. This indicates that the official sources do not support the claim.", "Passport application form": "The expert examined the Passport e-form on the portal and found that applicants are still required to fill in their citizenship details, including the 'nationality' column. This confirms that the 'nationality' column has not been removed from the passport application form.", "Confirmation from Passport Office": "The expert reached out to the Passport Office for confirmation, and an officer stated that the claim circulating on social media is completely false. The officer emphasized that without a 'nationality' column, it would be impossible to distinguish an Indian passport from passports of other countries. This official confirmation further supports the authenticity of the claim being debunked."}
