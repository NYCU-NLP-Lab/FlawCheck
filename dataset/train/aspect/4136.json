{"Putnam": "s general support of Trump's immigration policy: The expert's verdict states that Putnam generally supported Trump's immigration policy. This contradicts DeSantis' claim that Putnam opposed bringing troops to the southern border, as it implies that Putnam would have been in alignment with Trump's stance on immigration issues.", "Lack of major policy consideration for putting troops on the border in the early 2000s": "The expert's verdict mentions that the underlying policy of putting troops on the border was not a major consideration in the early 2000s. This suggests that Putnam's vote may have been influenced by factors other than opposition to border security measures."}
