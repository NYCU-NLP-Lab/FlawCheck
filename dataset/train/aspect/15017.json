{"The presence of firearms": "The expert highlights that U.S. Senator Ron Johnson questioned the presence of firearms during the Capitol riot, suggesting that an armed insurrection would involve a significant number of firearms. The expert counters this claim by stating that the definition of being \"armed\" extends beyond firearms, and that reports of weapons at the Capitol may have been understated due to limited searches and arrests.", "Intent of the rioters": "The expert argues that many individuals involved in the Capitol attack stated their intent was to stop the vote confirmation and keep former President Trump in office, despite the election results. This aligns with the definition of an insurrection, as it involves attempting to overthrow or disrupt the lawful authority.", "Growing understanding of the events": "The expert mentions that our understanding of the events and motivations behind the Capitol riot has evolved over time, as more than 230 individuals have been identified and charged. This suggests that the initial perception of the event may have been incomplete or lacked sufficient evidence.", "Casualties and violence": "The expert emphasizes that five people, including a U.S. Capitol Police officer, died during the riot. This indicates a significant level of violence and aggression exhibited by the mob, further contradicting the claim that the event did not resemble an armed insurrection."}
