{"The total number of Border Patrol agents stationed along the U": "S.-Mexico border is the highest it has ever been, according to data from the U.S. Office of Immigration Statistics. This aspect verifies the claim that more border patrol agents were put in place than at any time in history.", "The increase in Border Patrol staffing saw a significant bump under President George W": "Bush, with the number of agents rising by about 14 percent per year on average between 2001 and 2009. Under President Obama, the increase was about 3 percent per year between 2009 and 2011. This aspect provides context to the claim and acknowledges that the biggest increase in staffing occurred under a previous administration.", "The flow of undocumented immigrants across the U": "S.-Mexico border, measured in terms of net flow (arrivals minus departures), has been essentially a wash in recent years, according to statistics from the Pew Hispanic Center. This aspect supports the claim that the flow of undocumented workers across the border is lower than it has been in 40 years.", "While the claim specifically refers to the flow of undocumented workers": "it is likely that President Obama was referring to apprehensions of individuals crossing from Mexico to the United States. These apprehension numbers also support Obama's claim that the flow of undocumented workers across the border is lower than it has been in 40 years."}
