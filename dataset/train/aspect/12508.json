{"The percentage of emergency room visits for COVID": "19: The expert highlights that President Trump's claim of 97% of emergency room visits being for something other than COVID-19 is accurate, but this percentage is not a meaningful indicator. The expert explains that even during the worst periods of the pandemic, the percentage of ER visits due to a COVID-like illness never went higher than 7%.", "Misleading presentation of statistics": "The expert criticizes President Trump for presenting the 97% statistic as a sign that the U.S. is in \"great shape\" regarding the pandemic. The expert argues that this statistic is not as impressive as it sounds, as similar percentages (93% to 96%) could have been boasted during the worst periods of the pandemic.", "Increasing number of ER visits for COVID": "19: The expert mentions that although the current percentage of ER visits for COVID-19 is lower than before, it has been on the rise. This contradicts President Trump's claim that the U.S. is in \"great shape\" regarding the pandemic.", "Data source and limitations": "The expert explains that the 97% statistic likely comes from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), specifically from their National Syndromic Surveillance Project. The expert also highlights the limitations of this data, such as changes in healthcare seeking behavior and increased use of telemedicine, which may affect the number of people visiting the ER."}
