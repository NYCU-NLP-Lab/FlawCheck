{"Historical documentation": "The expert examined historical documents, such as Daniel Gu\u00e9rin's book \"Fascism and Big Business,\" which cited a speech by Adolf Hitler at the Nuremberg Congress in 1933. This provided evidence that Hitler made a statement about the Nazi party's vulnerability in its early stages.", "Corroborating testimonies": "The expert also considered testimonies from National Socialist leaders, including Joseph Goebbels, who acknowledged that the Nazi party could have been hindered or crushed if met with strong opposition in its infancy. These testimonies supported the authenticity of Hitler's claim.", "Comparison with original speech": "The expert referred to a 1934 book titled \"Die Reden Hitlers am Reichsparteitag 1933,\" which contained Hitler's speeches, including the referenced speech. A translation of the speech confirmed that the quote was largely accurate, although it may lack some vital context. This comparison provided further verification of the claim.", "Contextual analysis": "The expert analyzed the context in which Hitler made the statement. Hitler's remark about the Nazi party's vulnerability in its early stages aligned with his establishment of an authoritarian state within a democratic one. This analysis reinforced the authenticity of the claim."}
