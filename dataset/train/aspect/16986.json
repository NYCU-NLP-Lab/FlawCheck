{"The claim is supported by a specific source": "The claim about Florida's coastal and stormwater infrastructure receiving D-plus and D ratings by the American Society of Civil Engineers in 2016 is backed up by Gwen Graham, a former Democratic congresswoman, who mentioned this information in an opinion-editorial for the Tampa Bay Times.", "The claim aligns with the findings of the American Society of Civil Engineers": "The Florida Section of the American Society of Civil Engineers issues a report card every four years evaluating the condition of Florida's infrastructure. The report card includes grades for different sectors, and in 2016, the coastal and stormwater infrastructure received D-plus and D ratings, as mentioned by Gwen Graham.", "The claim is consistent with the assessment of Florida": "s beaches: The American Society of Civil Engineers also evaluated Florida's beaches, which are an important part of the coastal infrastructure. The assessment found that almost 61 percent of Florida's beaches are eroding and in need of ongoing maintenance, supporting the claim that coastal infrastructure is not prepared to handle climate change.", "The claim highlights the risk and consequences of inadequate infrastructure": "The expert's verdict emphasizes that Florida's coastal and stormwater infrastructure are critical areas during a storm and are not prepared to handle climate change. The poor ratings and erosion of beaches indicate that the infrastructure is in poor condition and at risk of failure, which aligns with the claim's assertion."}
