{"Discrepancies in weight measurements": "The expert's verdict highlights the inconsistency in the weight measurements of Hardik Patel during his fast. The first measurement on September 4th showed a weight of 58.3 kg, while the second measurement on the same day showed 65.3 kg. This raises doubts about the accuracy of the readings and the claim of weight gain.", "False reading due to wrong posture": "The expert's verdict mentions that the Superintendent of Sola Civil Hospital, Dr Desai, explained that the lower measurement of 58.3 kg could have been due to Hardik Patel's wrong posture during weighing. Taking support or being held by someone during the weighing process can significantly affect the recorded weight.", "Clarification from medical professionals": "The expert's verdict includes statements from Dr Manisha Panchal of Sola Civil Hospital, who clarified in a press conference that the significant discrepancies in Hardik Patel's weight were likely due to incorrect recordings. She stated that the weight recorded on September 4th (58.3 kg) might have been incorrect, and the weight on September 5th was 66.4 kg.", "Lack of conclusive evidence for weight gain": "The expert's verdict concludes that based on the available information, it cannot be concluded that Hardik Patel gained weight during his fast. The weight readings indicate a reduction of 11.6 kg, contrary to the earlier claim of a 20 kg weight loss. The expert highlights the need for caution and critical analysis of the evidence before accepting the claim of weight gain."}
