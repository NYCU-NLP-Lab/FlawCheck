{"The Green New Deal is a nonbinding resolution that cannot become law in its current form": "2. The resolution does not call for most homes to be torn down. It aims to upgrade existing buildings and build new buildings to improve energy and water efficiency.", "Much of the confusion and misinformation about the resolution stemmed from a botched rollout by its sponsors and relentless attacks from opponents": "4. The original version of the FAQ distributed by Ocasio-Cortez's staff included language and policies not found in the resolution, including the goal of upgrading or replacing every building in the U.S. for state-of-the-art energy efficiency over a 10-year period. However, this version was quickly retracted, and the final version of the FAQ removed this language, stating the goal as upgrading virtually every home and building for energy efficiency."}
