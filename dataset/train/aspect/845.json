{"The source of the claim": "The expert's verdict highlights that the claim originated from a news feature published in the science news magazine Europhysics News (EPN) in July-August 2016. This provides a specific source for the claim.", "Credibility of the source": "The expert's verdict mentions that EPN is not a purely scientific journal and includes speculation. It is owned by EDP Sciences, which is unrelated to the entity that owns the European Scientific Journal. This raises doubts about the credibility and scientific rigor of the source.", "Disavowal by the European Scientific Journal": "The publishers of the European Scientific Journal issued a statement clarifying that they had no involvement in publishing content on the 9/11 attacks. This indicates that the claim was falsely attributed to the European Scientific Journal, further questioning its authenticity.", "Biases and affiliations of the authors": "The expert's verdict highlights that the authors of the news feature have actively promoted 9/11 conspiracy theories and are associated with groups such as Architects & Engineers for 9/11 Truth and Scholars for 911 Truth. This suggests a potential bias in their research and undermines the impartiality of their claims."}
