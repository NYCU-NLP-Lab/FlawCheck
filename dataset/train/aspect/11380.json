{"Comparison of countries bombed by President Bush and President Obama": "The expert compared the list of countries bombed by both presidents, highlighting that Obama's list includes Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan, Somalia, Yemen, Libya, and Syria, while Bush's list includes Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan, and Somalia. This comparison helps verify the claim that Obama launched more strikes on predominantly Muslim countries.", "Analysis of drone strikes": "The expert mentions that drone strikes in Pakistan, Yemen, and Somalia have been in the news for a long time, regardless of official acknowledgment. This suggests that both Bush and Obama were involved in drone strikes in these countries, further supporting the claim.", "Verification through a nonprofit news service": "The Bureau of Investigative Journalism, a nonprofit news service, maintains a running list of U.S. military actions in various countries, including Pakistan, Somalia, and Yemen. The expert refers to this source to confirm that American drone strikes against suspected terrorists in Somalia occurred under both Bush and Obama. This adds credibility to the claim.", "Examination of evidence of airstrikes in Yemen": "The expert found evidence of only one airstrike in Yemen under Bush, reported by BBC News and Time magazine in 2002. This information contradicts the claim that there were twice as many strikes on predominantly Muslim countries under Obama, as it suggests that Obama's involvement in airstrikes in Yemen may have been higher. This aspect raises questions about the accuracy of the claim."}
