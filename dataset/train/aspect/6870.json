{"Change in the definition of violent crime": "The expert explains that the apparent increase in violent crime in South Bend is not due to a doubling of violent incidents but rather a change in how police count assaults. This means that the increase is a result of a change in the definition of the most common violent crime, not an actual increase in violent crime itself.", "Data manipulation": "The expert highlights that a conservative commentator used charts to suggest that violent crime spiked during Mayor Pete Buttigieg's tenure. However, the expert argues that this claim is misleading because it fails to consider the change in reporting practices that made it appear as if violent crime had significantly increased.", "Historical comparison": "The expert provides a historical comparison of the number of violent crimes reported in South Bend. They explain that in 2011, before Buttigieg took office, there were 744 violent crimes reported. In 2012, the number fell to 622, showing a drop of 16%. While there were increases in violent crimes in subsequent years, they still remained lower than the 2011 figure.", "FBI acknowledgment": "The expert mentions that the FBI itself acknowledged the change in South Bend's reporting practices, stating that the figures from 2016 onwards are not comparable to previous years' data. This acknowledgment supports the argument that the increase in reported violent crimes is not indicative of a real increase in crime but rather a change in reporting methods."}
