{"The claim is based on an old chain email that first gained attention in 2012": "2. The chain email provides a tally of presidential executive orders from Teddy Roosevelt to Obama, claiming that Obama issued 923 executive orders in his first 3.5 years and \"more than 1000+ and counting executive orders in six years.\"", "The tradition of executive orders dates back to George Washington": "but they were used sparingly in the first 100 years of the union.", "The actual numbers of executive orders issued by presidents": "provided by the University of California Santa Barbara The American Presidency Project, show that the chain email's tallies are incorrect and Obama is not the most prolific user of executive orders."}
