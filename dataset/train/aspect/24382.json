{"The claim is supported by a peer": "reviewed article published in Science in 2015, which ranked the 20 biggest contributors of \"mismanaged plastic waste\" based on modeling data.", "The United States ranked 20th on the list": "indicating that it contributes a relatively small percentage of mismanaged plastic waste to the oceans.", "The United States": "along with other advanced industrialized countries, has better waste management systems compared to lower-income nations, which contributes to its lower ranking as a global contributor of mismanaged plastic waste.", "The data used to support the claim is a decade old and based on modeling": "which introduces uncertainties and limitations to its accuracy. Additionally, the data does not address the origin of the plastic or who used it, leaving room for potential contributions from other countries."}
