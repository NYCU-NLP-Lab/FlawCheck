{"Statistical analyses of keywords": "The expert, Thomas Joscelyn, conducted statistical analyses of keywords used in ISIS and al-Qaida propaganda. He found that Guantanamo was rarely mentioned in their messages, videos, and publications, indicating that it plays an insignificant role in their propaganda.", "Analysis of ISIS magazine": "Joscelyn analyzed ISIS' monthly magazine, Dabiq, and found only four mentions of Guantanamo out of 12 issues. None of these mentions were in a recruitment context, and Guantanamo was not a main theme in any article. This further supports the claim that Guantanamo is not a key component of ISIS propaganda.", "Brookings Institution analysis": "Researchers at the Brookings Institution also conducted an analysis of terrorist propaganda, specifically focusing on material in English or with translations. Their findings were consistent with Joscelyn's conclusions, stating that ISIS rarely used Guantanamo as a propaganda tool, and al-Qaida used it even less frequently than before.", "Dominant topics in propaganda": "The expert's verdict mentions that other topics, such as the fight against the \"Zionist-Crusaders,\" establishing the caliphate, the fate of Palestine, U.S. military airstrikes targeting ISIS, and American occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan, dominate the propaganda of terrorist groups. This suggests that Guantanamo is not a major focus or recruitment tool in their messaging."}
