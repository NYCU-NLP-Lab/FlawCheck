{"Testimony from law enforcement agencies": "The expert consulted with law enforcement agencies, including the Dane County Sheriff\u2019s Department and Madison police, to gather information about the protests. They found that the protests were largely peaceful and orderly, with only a handful of arrests reported.", "Crowd estimates": "The expert obtained crowd estimates from Madison police and Capitol Police, which indicated that there were approximately 30,000 people outside the Capitol and 5,000 inside the building on February 18, 2011. These numbers suggest a large gathering of individuals but do not indicate a riotous situation.", "Comparison to previous protests": "The expert interviewed Paul Soglin, a former Madison mayor who had experience with antiwar protests in the 1960s and '70s. Soglin described the energy of the crowds as \"joy and enthusiasm\" and compared them to civil rights protests in the 1960s. Soglin's perspective contradicts the characterization of the events as riots.", "Lack of evidence for violent incidents": "The expert searched for evidence of violent incidents such as tear gas, broken windows, or injuries but did not find any substantial reports or evidence to support the claim of riots."}
