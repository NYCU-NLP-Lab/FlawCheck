{"Lack of credible evidence": "The expert's verdict highlights that there is no evidence to support the claim that George S. Patton made the statement about liberal Democrats being the lowest form of politicians. Various sources, including fact-checking organizations and reviews of Patton's diaries and letters, have failed to find any mention of this quote.", "Origins of the quote": "The expert's verdict mentions that the earliest known use of the quote can be traced back to a 1983 book by Charles Province called \"The Unknown Patton.\" However, Province did not provide any footnotes or evidence to support the claim that the quote came directly from Patton's World War II diary. This lack of verifiable sources raises doubts about the authenticity of the quote.", "Alternative attributions": "The expert's verdict reveals that the quote was also found in a 1948 book by Stuart Chase called \"The Proper Study of Mankind.\" However, a search of newspapers and other records did not show any instances of the quote or its attribution to Patton before 1988. This suggests that the quote may have been misattributed or falsely associated with Patton.", "Patton": "s personal views on politics: The expert's verdict provides insights into Patton's personal views on politics. While he expressed a general disdain for politics, he showed little understanding or interest in the topic. His grandson, Robert H. Patton, described his views as \"reactionary royalism\" and mentioned that Patton disdained labor unions and \"grafting politicians.\" However, there is no indication that Patton specifically made the statement about liberal Democrats being the lowest form of politicians."}
