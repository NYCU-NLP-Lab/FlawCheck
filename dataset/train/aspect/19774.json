{"The source of the claim is the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System": "VAERS), which is a database containing unverified reports of adverse events following immunization with US-licensed vaccines. The VAERS website explicitly states that these reports alone cannot be used to determine if a vaccine caused or contributed to an adverse event or illness.", "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention": "CDC), in charge of the VAERS program, has stated that there is no evidence indicating an increase in miscarriages after Covid-19 vaccines. They have not identified any concerning patterns of reporting regarding miscarriages following immunization.", "Dr": "Benjamin Neuman, an expert in coronaviruses, has stated that there is no association between vaccination and any aspect of reproduction.", "The Mayo Clinic states that miscarriage is a relatively common experience": "occurring in about 10-20 percent of known pregnancies, often when the fetus is not developing normally. This suggests that miscarriages can happen unrelated to Covid-19 vaccines."}
