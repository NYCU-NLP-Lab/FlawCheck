{"Multiple posts containing a photo of people standing beside a highway overpass with a banner were used to verify the claim": "2. The text on the banner, translated into English, says \"We are EDSA. United people's action,\" which refers to the \"People Power\" revolution in the Philippines in 1986.", "The doctored image of the banner had certain letters highlighted in yellow": "spelling out a Filipino profanity \"tae,\" which means \"shit\" in English. However, multiple images of the banner without the highlighted letters were found, indicating that the doctored image was not authentic.", "Other images": "including one from a tweet by the political party Kabataan, showed the same people holding the banner at the same event, celebrating the revolution rather than criticizing it."}
