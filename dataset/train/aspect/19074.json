{"The photograph is a genuine image of a traffic jam in China": "taken in October 2015 at the end of Golden Week, a week-long national holiday.", "The caption frequently attached to the image": "claiming it shows China's \"50 lane-highway\" with drivers merging down to just four lanes, is misleading.", "The congestion captured in the photograph occurred at a toll gate on the G4 Beijing": "Hong Kong-Macau Expressway, one of the country's busiest roads.", "While the toll gate area of the G4 Expressway may expand to approximately 50 cars wide": "the road itself is typically a 4-lane highway before and after the toll checkpoint."}
