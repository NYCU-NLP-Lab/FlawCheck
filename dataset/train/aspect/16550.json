{"The presence of video evidence": "The expert's verdict mentions that there is video footage available (https://www.c-span.org/video/?510139-1/president-biden-holds-news-conference&vod) showing some members of the press corps physically standing up as President Biden entered the room. This video evidence can be used to verify the claim.", "Confirmation from the White House": "The expert's verdict states that President Biden himself addressed the press corps by saying, \"Please, please, sit down. Thank you, thank you,\" at the start of the news conference. This confirms that some members of the press were indeed standing as claimed.", "Lack of official policy from the White House Correspondents": "Association (WHCA): The expert's verdict mentions that Snopes contacted the WHCA to inquire about their official policy on reporters standing when a president enters or exits a room, but did not receive a response. The absence of an official policy suggests that the act of standing may not be mandated or prohibited, further supporting the claim.", "Similar topics of questioning": "The expert's verdict notes that during the news conference, reporters asked questions on various topics, including immigration, reelection plans, North Korea's missile launch, and Middle Eastern policies. These topics are mentioned to be similar to those faced by former President Trump during his presidency, indicating that the press corps' behavior may not be influenced by bias towards President Biden."}
