{"The claim that Bill Nelson voted to cut": "700 billion out of Medicare to pay for Obamacare is a favored line among Republican candidates to charge their Democratic opponents with cutting Medicare.", "The health care law": "also known as Obamacare or the Affordable Care Act, did not literally cut funding from the Medicare program's budget. Instead, it implemented changes aimed at reducing future healthcare costs in the program.", "The spending reductions primarily affected insurance companies and hospitals": "rather than beneficiaries. Medicare Advantage, a subset of Medicare plans run by private insurers, saw significant reductions in funding. Additionally, hospitals faced penalties for excessive re-admissions and failure to meet new benchmarks for patient care.", "The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the health care law would reduce Medicare outlays by": "716 billion from 2013 to 2022. The intention behind these cost savings was to protect beneficiaries' coverage while incentivizing healthcare providers to become more efficient."}
