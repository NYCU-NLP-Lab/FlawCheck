{"The claim is based on a quote from a New York Times article published on September 11": "2001, in which William Ayers, a former member of the Weather Underground, stated, \"I don't regret setting bombs. I feel we didn't do enough.\" This quote is used to support the claim that Obama had a relationship with Ayers that continued after 9/11.", "The claim is further supported by the mention of an organizing meeting for Obama": "s state Senate campaign that was held at Ayers' house. This suggests a personal connection between Obama and Ayers.", "Hillary Clinton also adds to the verification of the claim by stating that Obama served on a board with Ayers for a period of time": "specifically referring to the Woods Foundation. This implies a professional association between Obama and Ayers.", "The fact that Obama downplays the relationship and defends himself by stating that Ayers is just a neighbor and not someone he regularly exchanges ideas with is another aspect that verifies the claim": "This response indirectly acknowledges the existence of a connection between Obama and Ayers, although Obama tries to downplay its significance."}
