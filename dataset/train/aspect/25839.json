{"Comparison of the current budget with the original estimate": "The expert's verdict mentions that Rick Baker argues that the current budget for the police station is significantly higher than the estimate determined in 2006. The claim and counterclaim focus on the difference of $35 million between the estimated cost of $50 million and the latest price tag of $86 million.", "Historical context and previous plans": "The expert's verdict highlights that plans for a new police station have been in the works since Rick Baker's tenure as mayor over a decade ago. This aspect provides historical context and suggests that the need for a new station and the expected costs were known prior to Rick Kriseman becoming mayor.", "Consultant report and cost assessment": "The expert's verdict mentions that in 2010, a consultant hired by the city revealed a report stating that St. Petersburg needed to spend $74 million to replace its police headquarters. This aspect adds credibility to the claim that the estimated cost of the new police station was higher than the initial $50 million estimate.", "Comparison of different projects and estimates": "The expert's verdict points out that Rick Baker's claim essentially compares two different projects, the pier and the police station, and holds Rick Kriseman accountable for an estimate that was determined before his mayoral term. This aspect highlights the potential flaw in comparing different projects and using outdated estimates to argue for cost overruns."}
