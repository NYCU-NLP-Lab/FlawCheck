{"Certification of election results by all 50 states and the District of Columbia": "The expert's verdict highlights that President Joe Biden was sworn into office on January 20, 2021, after all 50 states and the District of Columbia certified the election results affirming his win. This certification process involved recounts and audits in some states, providing a thorough verification of the election outcome.", "Lack of evidence in court cases challenging the election results": "The expert's verdict mentions that former President Donald Trump and his allies filed numerous lawsuits in state and federal courts to challenge the election results. However, not a single court case proved that voter fraud had affected the election outcome. This indicates that the claims of widespread voter fraud were not substantiated through legal means.", "Expert consensus on the absence of significant voter fraud": "The expert's verdict emphasizes that election officials in every state stated that there was no significant voter fraud during the voting process. Additionally, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency called the 2020 election \"the most secure in American history,\" and former Attorney General William Barr stated that the Justice Department had uncovered no evidence of widespread fraud. These expert opinions further support the authenticity of the claim.", "Constitutional process and official results": "The expert's verdict highlights the constitutional process of administering elections and counting votes, which lies within the power of the states. The states certified their results, some following audits and recounts, almost two months before President Biden's inauguration. Moreover, on January 7, Congress finalized the results, confirming Biden's win with 306 electoral votes. This official recognition of the election outcome adds credibility to the claim that Biden legally won the presidential election."}
