{"The district": "s estimate: The district provided an estimate of $220 per square foot in hard costs to rebuild the high schools. This estimate was based on the project estimating method provided by Rider Levett Bucknall, an international firm that estimates costs.", "Comparison to previous costs": "The expert's verdict mentions a news analysis by The Oregonian in 2011, which reported that the school rebuilds would be among the costliest in Oregon. The analysis showed that the district had budgeted $325 a square foot to renovate six urban schools. By comparing this previous cost to the current estimate of $220 per square foot, it helps verify the authenticity of the claim.", "Transparency efforts": "The school board stated that they had heard the public's demand for greater transparency and fiscal diligence. They put a $482 million bond measure on the ballot, with a smaller overall size and a lower cost per assessed property value compared to the previous bond measure. These transparency efforts indicate that the district is making an effort to spend taxpayer money wisely.", "Expert verification": "The expert's verdict mentions that the campaign openly links to the project estimating method, which contains the calculations by Rider Levett Bucknall. This international firm is recognized for estimating costs, adding credibility to the claim. The expert also mentions that they checked the claim at the request of a campaign opponent, further indicating an unbiased verification process."}
