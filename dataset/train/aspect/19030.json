{"The claim states that": "out of 588 school districts, we give 31 (former Abbott) districts 70 percent of the aid.\" The first aspect employed to verify the authenticity of this claim is the analysis of figures on the New Jersey Department of Education's website. PolitiFact New Jersey determined that, between K-12 education aid and preschool aid for the 2011-12 school year, the 31 former Abbott districts are set to receive about 60 percent of the aid.", "The second aspect is the confirmation from Justin Barra": "an Education Department spokesman, who confirmed the analysis of the percentage of aid dollars going to the former Abbott districts. Barra stated that a very small percentage of districts in New Jersey receive a majority of state aid, which supports the claim made by Governor Chris Christie.", "The third aspect is the historical context provided about the former Abbott districts": "It is explained that the Abbott vs. Burke court decisions have ensured greater state funding for certain districts as a way of addressing disparities between poor urban areas and wealthier suburbs. This background information adds credibility to the claim.", "The fourth aspect is the slight discrepancy in the number of school districts mentioned by Governor Chris Christie": "While he stated there are 588 school districts, the state Department of Education clarified that there are actually 590 districts operating school buildings, and 15 others that send students to other districts without operating their own facilities. This aspect highlights the need for accuracy in the claim but does not significantly impact the overall validity of the claim."}
