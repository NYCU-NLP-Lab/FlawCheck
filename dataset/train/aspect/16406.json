{"Opposition from Democrats and moderate Republicans": "The expert's verdict mentions that most Democrats and some moderate Republicans in the Legislature oppose the education reforms proposed by state Republican leaders. This opposition indicates that there is disagreement and debate surrounding the claim.", "Opposition from the teachers union": "The expert's verdict states that the teachers union also opposes the changes. The fact that a significant stakeholder in the education system is against the reforms adds credibility to the claim of it being an unfunded mandate.", "Concerns about budget concerns": "The expert's verdict mentions that the state's chief financial officer, Alex Sink, has a serious problem with placing more unfunded mandates on local school districts as they are already facing significant budget concerns. This concern about the financial implications of the reforms supports the claim of it being an unfunded mandate.", "Shift in pay scales": "The expert's verdict explains that the proposed education bill would cause a major shift from current pay scales, which base salaries on degrees and years of experience, to performance-based bonuses based on test scores and other guidelines. This change in pay structure suggests that additional funding would be required to implement the new system, further supporting the claim of it being an unfunded mandate."}
