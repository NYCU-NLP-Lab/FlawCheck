{"Historical evidence": "The expert refers to historical events and the 1918 flu pandemic to support the claim. They mention that public health officials in New York City ordered windows to remain open for ventilation during the pandemic.", "Engineering design": "The expert explains that engineers in the early 20th century designed steam heating and radiators specifically to heat buildings with open windows, even in cold weather. This design aspect supports the claim that some steam radiators were built to keep dwellings warm with windows open.", "Fresh Air Movement": "The expert mentions the \"Fresh Air Movement,\" which was inspired by the 1918 flu pandemic. This movement advocated for keeping windows open to circulate fresh air and prevent the spread of airborne diseases. It further supports the claim that open windows were encouraged during the pandemic.", "Corroborating sources": "The expert mentions a Bloomberg story and quotes a historian of heating, Dan Holohan, who supports the claim. Holohan's research and engineering books from the 1920s are mentioned as additional sources that provide evidence of the practice of keeping windows open for ventilation during the 1918 pandemic."}
