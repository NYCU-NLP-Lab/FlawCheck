{"The expert examined a Facebook post by Kendra Fershee": "in which she claimed that \"Poverty in WV is more than 5% higher than the national average.\" The post provided a specific quote from Fershee and highlighted her concern about the poverty rate in West Virginia.", "The expert cross": "referenced the claim with an article from the Parkersburg News and Sentinel, titled \"Poverty increases in W.Va.\" The article stated that approximately 336,000 West Virginians lived in poverty in 2017, which was 5.7 percent higher than the national average. This article provided additional evidence supporting Fershee's claim.", "To verify the accuracy of the newspaper": "s data, the expert consulted the original figures from the U.S. Census Bureau. The data confirmed that the poverty rate in West Virginia was indeed 5.7 percentage points higher than the national average, with West Virginia's poverty rate at 19.1 percent compared to the U.S. poverty rate of 13.4 percent.", "The expert noted that Fershee": "s statement could have been more precise, as she should have referred to the poverty rate in West Virginia as being more than 5 percentage points higher than the national average, rather than simply 5 percent higher. This clarification highlights the actual magnitude of the difference between the two rates."}
