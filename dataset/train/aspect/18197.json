{"The expert": "s verdict highlights the fact that the identities and demographic profiles of most perpetrators of mass shootings in the first half of 2018 were not readily available. This aspect indicates that it may be challenging to verify the claim's statement regarding the demographics of mass shooters during that period.", "Another aspect mentioned by the expert": "s verdict is the expansion of the definition of a mass shooting, which resulted in a list of incidents that included five cases where women were identified as responsible. This aspect contradicts the claim's assertion that no mass shootings were committed by women."}
