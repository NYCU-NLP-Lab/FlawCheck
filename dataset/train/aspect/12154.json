{"Lack of official announcement": "The expert highlights that the manufacturer of Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, The Hershey Company, has not made any official announcement regarding the discontinuation of the candy. This lack of an official statement raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Unreliable source": "The claim originated from BreakingNews365.net, a prank website known for generating fake headlines and articles. The expert points out that this website, along with its related site BreakingNews247.net, allows users to fabricate news stories and manipulate the number of shares on social media. The unreliability of the source further questions the credibility of the claim.", "Inconsistencies in the article": "The expert highlights several inconsistencies in the article that indicate it may be fake news. These inconsistencies include the absence of specific details such as the manufacturer's name, location of the press conference, and the lack of attribution for a quote supposedly from the press conference. Additionally, the article is poorly written, containing grammatical mistakes and inappropriate use of exclamation marks.", "Sales data and popularity": "The expert presents sales data to support the argument against the claim. Reese's Peanut Butter Cups are recognized as the largest-selling candy in the United States, with significant consumer demand. The expert mentions that during a specific period, U.S. consumers purchased over $47 million worth of Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, surpassing their closest competitor by $8 million. This data contradicts the claim of a severe decline in sales and supports the notion that the claim is likely false."}
