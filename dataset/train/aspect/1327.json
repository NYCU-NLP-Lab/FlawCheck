{"The claim is supported by a study conducted by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation": "which found that over a 12-year period from 1991 to 2002, three out of four drivers involved in fatal or serious-injury crashes related to drinking and driving had no prior convictions for OWI (Operating While Intoxicated) on their driving record.", "The Mothers Against Drunk Driving": "MADD) organization relied on the \"Alcohol Traffic Facts\" booklet published by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation in 2003 as a source for their claim. Although the information may be dated, it was the most recent research available at the time of MADD's news release.", "The expert": "s verdict mentions that the statistic used by MADD focuses on drivers who had been drinking, which is a broader category than just \"drunken drivers.\" This suggests that the claim includes not only drivers who are legally intoxicated but also those who have consumed alcohol before driving.", "The Century Council": "a distilled spirits trade group, cites 2012 federal government crash data showing that 87 percent of fatal drunken driving crashes in Wisconsin involved a driver with a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) level above the legal limit. Although this statistic doesn't directly address the claim about first-time offenders, it provides additional evidence supporting MADD's claim about the prevalence of drunk driving-related accidents."}
