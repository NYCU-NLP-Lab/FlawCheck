{"Analysis of Arctic polar bear subpopulations": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim was verified by analyzing 13 out of 19 Arctic polar bear subpopulations, which collectively represent about 80% of the species. This analysis helped determine the likelihood of reproductive failure and extinction for many of these populations.", "Reproductive failure as a precursor to extinction": "The expert's verdict highlights that the analysis showed that many Arctic polar bear subpopulations were likely or very likely to experience reproductive failure, which is considered a precursor to extinction. This aspect reinforces the claim that polar bears may be wiped out by the end of the 21st century.", "Conservative estimates and the point of no return": "The expert's verdict mentions that the published study's estimates were conservative, suggesting that the situation might be worse than predicted. Furthermore, it is noted that many subpopulations would have passed a point of no return in terms of reproduction before 2100. These aspects emphasize the urgency of the issue and the potential for irreversible damage.", "Urgency of emissions reductions": "The expert's verdict emphasizes that climate change caused by greenhouse gas emissions poses a significant threat to polar bears' existence. It is stated that more ambitious emissions cuts are urgently needed to prevent the extirpation of several polar bear populations. This aspect underscores the importance of taking immediate action to mitigate the impact of climate change on polar bears."}
