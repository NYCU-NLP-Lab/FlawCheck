{"The initial claim made by Marco Rubio that North Korea has": "over two-dozen nuclear warheads\" was contradicted by numerous credible arms and security organizations, which estimate North Korea's nuclear arsenal to be between six and 16 nuclear weapons.", "Rubio": "s campaign provided a link to a story that supported the estimate of 16 nuclear warheads but also noted a Chinese estimate of up to 20 warheads. However, this still falls far short of the claim of \"over two-dozen\" warheads.", "Think tanks such as the Nuclear Threat Initiative": "the Arms Control Association, and the Stockholm International Peace and Research Institute share the view that North Korea has the capability to construct up to eight plutonium-fueled nuclear weapons, further undermining the claim of \"over two-dozen\" warheads.", "A report from the Congressional Research Service in 2013 estimated that North Korea has enough plutonium for": "at least a half dozen\" weapons and the capability to produce another single \"bomb's worth of plutonium per year,\" which again contradicts the claim of \"over two-dozen\" warheads."}
