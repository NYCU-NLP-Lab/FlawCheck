{"Reverse image search": "The first aspect employed to verify the authenticity of the claim was a reverse image search. This revealed that the carving of a figure riding a bicycle was actually located in the Balinese temple Pura Maduwe Karang in Indonesia, not the Panchavarnaswamy Temple in Tamil Nadu.", "Historical context": "The second aspect involved examining the historical context of the carving. Author David Shavit's book mentioned that the carving in question depicted Dutch Artist WOJ Nieuwnkamp, who explored Bali on a bicycle. This information provided further evidence that the carving was not related to ancient India.", "Watermark identification": "The third aspect involved noticing a watermark of SMHoaxSlayer, a fact-checking outlet, on one of the images. This indicated that the image had been previously debunked or identified as misleading, raising doubts about its authenticity.", "Expert opinion": "The fourth aspect involved consulting an expert, Dr Kalaikovan, an ophthalmologist and researcher of historical matters. He provided a logical explanation for the carving's existence in the Chola-era temple, suggesting that it was not evidence of ancient Indian bicycle invention. His opinion added weight to the conclusion that the claim was not authentic."}
