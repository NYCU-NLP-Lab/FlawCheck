{"McCain": "s repeated charge: The expert mentions that McCain had previously leveled a similar charge against Obama and Clinton at Carnegie Mellon University. This repetition of the claim by McCain strengthens its credibility and suggests that it is a consistent argument made by him.", "Analysis by the Urban": "Brookings Tax Policy Center: The expert refers to an analysis conducted by the nonpartisan Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, which states that Obama's plan would generate $2.7 trillion less over 10 years compared to allowing Bush's tax cuts to expire on schedule. This analysis provides evidence that contradicts the claim of Obama proposing the largest tax increase since World War II.", "Expert opinion": "The expert quotes Leonard Burman, co-director of the center, who states that Obama is actually proposing a tax cut, not a tax increase. This expert opinion supports the argument that the claim is not accurate and further verifies the authenticity of the claim."}
