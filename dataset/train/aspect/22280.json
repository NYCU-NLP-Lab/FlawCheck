{"The claim is based on a New York Times": "Morning Consult poll conducted in 2018, which reached 1,858 men and women ages 20 to 45.", "Among the approximately 340 people who stated they had or expected to have fewer children than they considered ideal": "64 percent cited the high cost of child care as the reason.", "The second most common reason": "at 54 percent, was wanting more time with the children they already have.", "However": "sociologists have pointed out that while the poll provides useful data, it does not provide extremely strong evidence to definitively establish the high cost of child care as the number one reason for having fewer children. The sample size was relatively small, and there are limited similar polls to cross-check the results."}
