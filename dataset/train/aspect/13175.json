{"Comparison to previous years": "The expert examined data from 2003 to 2011 to compare the current domestic oil production levels to previous years. This comparison helps verify the claim that under President Obama, domestic oil production is at an eight-year high.", "Monthly statistics for 2012": "The expert also considered the available data for 2012, specifically the month of January, which showed the largest monthly output of oil since August 1998. This additional data supports the claim of increased oil production under President Obama.", "Stability of production levels": "The expert noted that although there has been an increase in oil production, the levels have remained relatively stable over the last nine years. This information provides context and suggests that the increase cited by the Obama campaign is not particularly significant.", "Contribution of federal lands": "The expert examined the contribution of federal lands to domestic oil production. While federal lands produced 31.8% of domestic oil last year, slightly below the nine-year average, the increase in production came from state and privately-owned lands. This aspect helps determine the role of President Obama's policies and control over federal lands in influencing oil production levels."}
