However, the source of the $19 billion figure is not provided by the claimant, and the expert could not verify how this number was calculated.", "The claim asserts that Texas has tripled its dependence on wind energy to 23": "25 percent of its energy distribution system over the past 2-3 years. The expert's verdict confirms that wind energy has seen significant growth in Texas, but it does not provide specific data or statistics to validate the claim's percentage increase.", "The expert": "s verdict discusses the inclusion of the $7 billion Competitive Renewable Energy Zone transmission lines in the calculation of wind energy subsidies. These transmission lines, funded by ratepayers, help transport power from West Texas wind and solar generators to major cities in the state. There is debate over whether these transmission lines should be considered a traditional subsidy. The inclusion or exclusion of this project affects the total calculation of wind energy subsidies."}
