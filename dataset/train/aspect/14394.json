{"Comparison of energy sources": "The expert analyzed the claim by comparing the energy content of natural gas and oil, which are measured differently (cubic feet vs. barrels) and have different energy content. This aspect involved complex math to convert and compare the two fuels.", "Proved reserves": "The expert examined the proved reserves of oil in Saudi Arabia and natural gas in the United States. Proved reserves are resources that are likely to be developed under current conditions. The expert found that Saudi Arabia has significantly higher proved reserves of oil compared to the United States' proved reserves of natural gas.", "Technically recoverable resources": "The expert also considered the technically recoverable resources of oil in Saudi Arabia and natural gas in the United States. Technically recoverable resources refer to resources that could be developed using current technology, regardless of cost. The expert found that Saudi Arabia's estimates for technically recoverable resources of oil are much higher than the United States' estimates for natural gas.", "Energy content equivalence": "To further verify the claim, the expert calculated the energy content equivalence between natural gas and oil. By converting the energy content into British thermal units, the expert determined that 1 trillion cubic feet of natural gas is equivalent to 165 million barrels of crude oil. This aspect helped provide a standardized measure for comparing the two energy sources."}
