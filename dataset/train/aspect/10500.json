{"Comparison to specific countries and regions": "The expert's verdict notes that Bernie Sanders made comparisons between Baltimore and specific countries and regions such as North Korea, the West Bank in Palestine, distressed cities in Nigeria, India, China, and South Africa. This aspect of the claim was employed to highlight the dire conditions in some Baltimore neighborhoods.", "Statistical evidence": "The expert's verdict mentions that Sanders referred to an article from The Washington Post that reported on 14 Baltimore neighborhoods having shorter life expectancies than North Korea in 2013. Additionally, data from the Baltimore City Health Department was provided to support the claim that residents in 12 of Baltimore's neighborhoods lived shorter lives. These statistics were used to verify the authenticity of the claim.", "Expert opinion": "The expert on urban poverty at the Brookings Institution, Alan Berube, supported Sanders' claim by stating that there are neighborhoods in many big U.S. cities and metropolitan areas, as well as rural communities, that perform just as poorly in terms of health and economic outcomes. This expert opinion adds credibility to the claim.", "Visual representation": "The expert's verdict includes a map from the University of Maryland's Capital News Service that compares the life expectancies of Baltimore neighborhoods in 2013 to other places in the world. This visual representation serves as additional evidence to support the claim that conditions in some Baltimore neighborhoods are comparable to those in poorer countries."}
