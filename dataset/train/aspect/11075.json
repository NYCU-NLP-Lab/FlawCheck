{"The claim of the Republican tax plan being the largest tax cut in U": "S. history is based on statements made by President Donald Trump and others in the administration.", "The White House has not provided any supporting evidence or information to back up this claim": "3. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated the cost of the tax plan to be around $2.2 trillion over 10 years, which would make it one of the largest tax cuts in terms of inflation-adjusted dollars.", "However": "according to a Treasury Department analysis, the designation of the largest tax cut in history would actually go to either President Ronald Reagan's 1981 tax cut or President Barack Obama's 2012 extension of the George W. Bush-era income tax cuts, depending on how the size of the tax cut is measured."}
