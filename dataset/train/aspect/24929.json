{"Testimony from a landscape architect": "The expert's verdict includes a statement from Perry Guillot, a landscape architect involved in the project, who rejected the claims that Melania Trump ripped out cherry trees, crabapple trees, and roses from 1913 when redoing the White House Rose Garden. Guillot's expertise and involvement in the project provide credibility to his statement.", "Historical evidence": "The expert's verdict mentions that the last major work on the garden took place in 1962 during the Kennedy presidency, which was one year prior to John F. Kennedy's assassination. This historical fact contradicts the claim that the garden was a tribute to the late president, supporting the authenticity of Melania Trump's redesign.", "Official documentation": "The White House Rose Garden Landscape Report is referenced in the expert's verdict, which outlines and explains the recent redesign. The report lists all 11 tree species in the garden and states that cherry trees were not present. The use of official documentation adds weight to the verification process.", "Lack of evidence supporting the claim": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim was primarily based on a tweet featuring photos of the garden before and after the redesign. However, no concrete evidence or sources were provided in the claim to support the allegation of Melania Trump removing specific trees and roses. The absence of supporting evidence weakens the authenticity of the claim."}
