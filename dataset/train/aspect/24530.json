{"The Congressional Budget Office": "CBO) analysis clearly states that the health insurance reform legislation will reduce the federal deficit by $138 billion in the first ten years (2010-2019) through changes in direct spending and revenue.", "The CBO": "s preliminary estimate does not specifically state that the legislation will cut the deficit by $1.2 trillion in the second ten years. Instead, it projects that the legislation would reduce deficits \"in a broad range around one-half percent of GDP\" during that period.", "House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other Democratic leaders extrapolated the": "1.2 trillion figure based on a forecast of future gross domestic product (GDP) growth, which the CBO does not explicitly provide. They projected GDP growth at an average rate of 4 percent per year for the next ten years after 2020.", "Some experts": "like Jim Horney from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, believe that Pelosi's estimate of $1.2 trillion deficit reduction in the second ten years is conservative. Horney suggests that if GDP continues to rise at an average rate of 4 percent per year, the deficit reduction could be even higher."}
