{"The online advertisement displayed a picture of an Olive Garden Italian Restaurant sign along with text that read": "Closing Time: Here's All The Restaurant Chains Closing in 2020.\" However, the actual story headline was different and mentioned that Olive Garden was losing money fast, not closing down completely.", "The story only mentioned that two Olive Garden locations had closed in Springfield": "Massachusetts, and Birmingham, Alabama, in March and April 2020, respectively. This indicates that Olive Garden did not go out of business in 2020.", "The financial hardship faced by Olive Garden and other restaurants during the COVID": "19 pandemic is acknowledged, with the closure of dine-in services leading to less revenue and lost jobs.", "Reports from reputable sources": "such as Nation's Restaurant News and InvestorPlace.com, indicate that Darden Restaurants, the owner of Olive Garden, managed to survive the pandemic and even made money at Olive Garden despite closing half its tables. The expectation of positive earnings for the quarter ending in November 2020 further supports the authenticity of the claim."}
