{"Lincoln approved the execution of 39 Dakota men convicted by a military commission for perpetrating massacres during the Dakota War of 1862": "2. Lincoln commuted the death sentences of 264 other Native Americans, despite threats of mob violence and intense pressure to reverse his decision.", "The claim that Lincoln ordered the execution of 38 Native American warriors is largely accurate but misleading": "as it fails to mention that he also prevented the hangings of 264 other Native Americans by commuting their sentences.", "The death sentences did not originate with Lincoln but were ordered by a military commission and sent to the president for approval or denial": ""}
