{"The claim was initially made during a public access program called": "State of the State\" by host Rebecca Quigley, who stated that the average life expectancy of a woman in the sex trade is seven years.", "A 2004 study published in the American Journal of Epidemiology was referenced": "which examined the lives of female prostitutes in Colorado Springs over a period of 33 years. The study found that fewer than 8 percent of the tracked prostitutes died during that time.", "The authors of the study": "when contacted, stated that the actual life expectancy of prostitutes is not known, but it is not seven years. They emphasized that the claim of a seven-year life expectancy is a dramatic overstatement with zero basis.", "Melissa Farley": "a clinical psychologist and anti-prostitution activist, was mentioned as a source who has made similar claims in the past. However, she admitted that she has never seen any documentation to support the specific claim of a seven-year life expectancy."}
