{"Lack of evidence": "The expert's verdict states that there is no evidence to support the claim that Nancy Green, the first Aunt Jemima model, died as one of America's first black millionaires. This lack of evidence undermines the authenticity of the claim.", "Newsworthiness": "The expert points out that if Nancy Green had indeed been a black millionaire at the time of her death in 1923, it would have been newsworthy. This suggests that there is no historical record or significant documentation to support the claim.", "Source of the claim": "The claim originated from a Facebook post by Peggy Hubbard, a black Republican and former U.S. Senate candidate. The post included a screenshot from Green's Wikipedia page, which does not mention her being a millionaire. This raises questions about the credibility and accuracy of the claim.", "Verification by fact": "checkers: The expert mentions that fact-checkers from Snopes also researched the claim and found no evidence to support it. This external verification adds weight to the conclusion that the claim is not authentic."}
