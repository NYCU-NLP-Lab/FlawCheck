{"The lack of credible evidence": "The expert's verdict highlights that the claims made by Neon Nettle and other conspiracy websites lack credible evidence to support the idea that seven key witnesses to the Las Vegas shooting have died under suspicious circumstances. The expert points out that the deaths mentioned in the article were not linked, and some of the individuals were not even witnesses to the shooting.", "Discrediting conspiracy theories": "The expert's verdict explains that conspiracy theorists have been pushing the narrative that the Las Vegas shooting was a cover-up and involved multiple shooters. However, law enforcement agencies have concluded that Stephen Paddock was the lone gunman. This aspect discredits the conspiracy theories and supports the official investigation's findings.", "Coincidences and misidentification": "The expert's verdict mentions that some of the deaths and disappearances mentioned in the Neon Nettle article were coincidental or misidentified by conspiracy theorists. For example, one of the \"key witnesses\" named in the article is actually the shooter, Stephen Paddock. This aspect highlights the lack of accuracy and reliability in the claims made by Neon Nettle.", "Lack of motive or connection": "The expert's verdict states that there is no evidence to suggest a sinister plot or cover-up related to the deaths of the alleged key witnesses. The individuals mentioned in the article had no apparent motive or connection to the shooting, and some of the deaths were unrelated to the incident. This aspect undermines the claim of a cover-up and casts doubt on the credibility of the conspiracy theory."}
