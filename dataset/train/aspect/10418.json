{"The claim was found to be based on an outdated article published in September 2014": "which misrepresented the events and gave a misleading version of the comments made by Sean Hannity about Muslims.", "The expert pointed out that while Sean Hannity did have a heated exchange with Muslim cleric Anjem Choudary in 2014": "he did not lose his job over the interview. This contradicted the claim that he was about to be fired in June 2016.", "The Facebook page": "American News, which posted the claim, was engaging in \"like-farming\" by asking for \"20,000 likes.\" This practice aims to collect responses from unsuspecting social media users and can be used to spread malicious software. The expert highlighted that clicking \"like\" on a Facebook page would not have any impact on someone's job status.", "The expert also mentioned that the author of the article": "Dan Evon, is a former writer for Snopes, a reputable fact-checking website. This detail adds credibility to the expert's verdict and reinforces the claim's lack of authenticity."}
