{"The expert mentions that home remedies and oddball uses of everyday products": "such as used dryer sheets, VapoRub, vanilla, frogs, and marigolds, are ineffective in repelling mosquitoes and protecting against West Nile Virus. This suggests that the authenticity of the claim is being verified by debunking the effectiveness of these remedies.", "The expert highlights the use of DEET as an effective mosquito repellent": "They explain that DEET does not kill mosquitoes but makes them unable to locate individuals. This aspect verifies the claim by providing a scientifically proven method of repelling mosquitoes.", "The expert references a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine in July 2002": "This study scientifically compared a wide range of products for their effectiveness in repelling mosquitoes. The fact that the study found most insect repellents containing herbal oils to be less effective than those containing DEET supports the authenticity of the claim.", "The expert mentions the research conducted by Mark Fradin and Jonathan Day of the University of Florida": "They tested 17 nationally marketed mosquito repelling products under laboratory conditions and found that products containing DEET repelled mosquitoes the best. This aspect further reinforces the authenticity of the claim by providing scientific evidence from a reputable source."}
