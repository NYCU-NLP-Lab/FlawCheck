{"Unemployment rate": "The expert examined the claim that the unemployment rate doubled under Sen. Robert Menendez's watch. They analyzed federal labor data and found that the unemployment rate was 4.7% in January 2006 and reached a peak of 10% in October 2009. However, at the time the claim was made, the latest data showed the jobless rate was 8.1%, which is less than double the 2006 rate.", "National debt": "The expert investigated the assertion that the nation's debt doubled under Sen. Menendez's tenure. They utilized data from the U.S. Treasury Department and found that the gross national debt was approximately $8.17 trillion on January 18, 2006, the day Menendez took office. As of the expert's analysis, the debt had increased to around $16.16 trillion, nearly doubling since 2006.", "Budget deficit": "The expert also examined the claim that the federal budget deficit quadrupled during Sen. Menendez's time in office. They referred to the Office of Management and Budget and discovered that the budget for fiscal year 2006 had a deficit of approximately $250 billion. In 2009, the deficit reached a peak of about $1.4 trillion, which is more than quadruple the deficit in 2006.", "Attribution of economic trends": "The expert pointed out that it is \"beyond ridiculous\" to solely attribute the increases in unemployment, debt, and deficit to one senator. They emphasized that various factors contribute to these economic trends, and it is unreasonable to pin the responsibility solely on Sen. Menendez."}
