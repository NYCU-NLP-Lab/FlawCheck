{"Multiple variations of the claim circulating on Facebook attribute the information to different sources": "such as a physician named Irene Ken, a professor in infectious diseases at Johns Hopkins University, or John Hopkins Hospital. This inconsistency raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Johns Hopkins Medicine": "a reputable institution known for tracking the spread of COVID-19, explicitly stated on its Facebook page that it is not affiliated with the points circulating online. Their denial of involvement adds to the skepticism surrounding the claim.", "Expert opinions from Dr": "Benjamin Neuman and Dr. Julian Leibowitz, both renowned experts in coronaviruses, contradict the information presented in the claim. They explain that the virus is an RNA virus, not a protein molecule with DNA, and it does not mutate the genes of the host to convert them into aggressor and multiplier cells. This expert analysis undermines the credibility of the claim.", "However": "one aspect of the claim is verified by Dr. Wendy Kei, who confirms that the virus, being a protein molecule, does decay on its own and the disintegration time depends on factors such as temperature, humidity, and the type of material where it lies. This point aligns with scientific knowledge and adds a degree of legitimacy to the claim."}
