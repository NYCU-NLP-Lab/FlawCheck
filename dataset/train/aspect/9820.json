{"The claim is based on a statement made by Missouri Governor Eric Greitens": "who signed a law making Missouri a right-to-work state and claimed that job growth in right-to-work states has been twice as high as in non-right-to-work states over the past 25 years.", "The claim references a 2015 article from the Illinois Policy Institute": "a conservative think tank, authored by Michael Lucci. Lucci reported that job growth in right-to-work states from 1990-2015 was 47 percent, while job growth in non-right-to-work states was 21 percent during the same period. Lucci used data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics to calculate the percent change in nonfarm job growth in each state.", "The data used in the claim was not adjusted for population": "which may affect the accuracy of the comparison between right-to-work and non-right-to-work states. Gordon Lafer, an associate professor at the University of Oregon, and a former senior labor policy adviser for the U.S. House of Representatives' Committee on Education and Labor, argues that aggregating job growth totals from different states is less accurate than comparing growth within individual states.", "An analysis that adjusted the data for population showed that of the eight states with more than 10 percent job growth from 1990 to 2015": "six had right-to-work laws. However, it is important to note that this analysis does not establish a causal relationship between right-to-work laws and job growth, as there may be other factors at play."}
