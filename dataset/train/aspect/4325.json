These trials demonstrated that the benefits of the vaccines outweigh the risks.", "CDC and FDA vaccine safety monitoring systems": "The expert mentions that the CDC and FDA have established vaccine safety monitoring systems, which were expanded for the COVID-19 vaccines. These systems include a smartphone-based reporting tool called v-safe. The systems have identified only a few very rare adverse events related to the vaccines.", "Misrepresentation of FDA document": "The expert points out that the claim is based on a misrepresentation of an FDA document.
