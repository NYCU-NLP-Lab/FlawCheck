{"Sayoc": "s party affiliation: The expert's verdict mentions that Sayoc registered with the Republican Party of Florida on March 4, 2016, less than two weeks before Trump won the Florida Republican presidential primary. This verifies that Sayoc was indeed a registered Republican at the time of the claim.", "Incomplete voter registration applications": "Records from the Miami-Dade County Elections Department show that Sayoc initiated, but didn't complete, new voter registration applications on two occasions in October 2012. This indicates that Sayoc had attempted to register as a Republican in the past, further supporting his party affiliation.", "Lack of information in voter registration applications": "The expert's verdict mentions that Sayoc's 2012 voter registration applications had missing information, such as the answer to a question about mental incapacitation and the section asking for a Florida driver's license or Social Security number. This suggests that Sayoc's applications were incomplete and supports the idea that he was not a registered Democrat at the time.", "False flag theories and Facebook": "s flagging: The expert's verdict mentions that false flag theories persist, but Facebook flagged the story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation. This indicates that there is a recognition of the claim being potentially misleading or inaccurate, further casting doubt on the authenticity of Sayoc being a Democrat posing as a Republican."}
