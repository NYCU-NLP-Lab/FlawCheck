{"President Obama": "s statement: President Obama explicitly stated that the purpose of the Keystone XL pipeline is to allow Canada to pump their oil and send it through the United States to the Gulf, where it will be sold to other countries. This statement serves as a direct claim about the pipeline's purpose and destination.", "Expert opinion on the primary destination": "Energy economics experts believe that a significant portion, if not the majority, of the crude oil transported by the Keystone XL pipeline will be purchased and used by American refineries. This expert opinion supports the claim that the primary destination of the oil is within the United States.", "State Department report": "A recent report from the State Department argues that it would not be economically justified for Canada to primarily export the Keystone XL oil to countries other than the United States, given the availability of American refineries to consume it. This report provides additional evidence supporting the claim that the oil's primary destination is within the United States.", "Need for crude oil by American refineries": "Independent refineries in the upper Midwest and Texas are in desperate need of crude oil. Currently, these refineries have to import oil from other countries like Venezuela and Nigeria. The availability of the Keystone XL oil to these refineries suggests that a significant portion of the oil will be used domestically, further supporting the claim."}
