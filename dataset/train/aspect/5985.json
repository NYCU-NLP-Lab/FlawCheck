{"The number of tenured teachers": "The expert attempted to verify the claim by investigating the number of tenured teachers in the public school system in New Jersey over the past decade. They reached out to the governor's office and the state Department of Education to check the accuracy of the claim that there were 150,000 tenured teachers during that time period.", "Lack of records": "The expert discovered that the state education officials did not have any records detailing the number of tenured teachers in the public school system from 2000 to 2011. This lack of official records made it difficult to verify the claim accurately.", "Number of dismissals": "The expert obtained records from state education officials that showed 17 cases of teachers being dismissed for \"inefficiency\" or \"incompetence\" between 2001 and 2010. They compared this number to the claim made by Governor Chris Christie that only 17 tenured teachers had been dismissed for incompetence in the last ten years.", "Unclear evidence": "The expert noted that while the number of dismissals provided by state education officials supported Christie's argument, there were still uncertainties regarding the accuracy of the claim. The expert mentioned that the governor's office did not provide an explanation for the figure of 150,000 tenured teachers, and the lack of official records made it challenging to fully verify the claim."}
