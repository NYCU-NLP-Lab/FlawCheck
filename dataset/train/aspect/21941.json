{"The claim originated from a tweet by Roseanne Barr": "where she retweeted a post alleging that Michelle Obama had ordered her firing from the show.", "The tweet that Barr retweeted was from a Twitter user named Josh Cornett": "who claimed that ABC President Channing Dungey had a conversation with Michelle Obama before deciding to cancel the show.", "Your News Wire": "a website, published an article supporting the claim and citing unnamed \"sources within ABC\" to back it up. However, the link provided in the article only led to Cornett's tweet, and no other corroborating information was found.", "Barr later tweeted and deleted a remark about apologizing to Michelle Obama": "Valerie Jarrett, and \"GS,\" but aside from Cornett's initial tweet and subsequent blog posts based on it, no other evidence supported the claim that Michelle Obama influenced ABC's decision to cancel Roseanne."}
