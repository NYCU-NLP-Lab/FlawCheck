{"The article in question was published on a website called the Greenville Gazette in February 2015": "2. The article claimed that a proposed bill called the Teacher's Protection Act in Texas would allow teachers to use deadly force on school property, school buses, or school-sponsored events.", "The proposed bill": "filed by State Rep. Dan Flynn, did exist but did not advance into law or draw a hearing. The last action shown in legislative records was its referral to the House Public Education Committee on March 4, 2015.", "The bill stated that an educator is justified in using force or deadly force in defense of themselves or students if they reasonably believe it to be immediately necessary": "but it did not explicitly mention killing students. State Rep. Flynn stated that the claim mischaracterized the bill and that its purpose was to protect teachers from facing charges for defending themselves against student assault."}
