{"Different photographers and news services": "The first aspect mentioned by the expert is that the photographs in question were taken by two different photographers and came from two different news services, Associated Press (AP) and Getty Images via Agence France-Presse (AFP). This suggests that the difference in wording could be due to different stylistic standards or personal preferences of the photographers and editors.", "Varied wording in captions": "The expert also points out that similar photographs from the same news services used different terms to describe the actions depicted, such as \"looting,\" \"raiding,\" \"taking,\" \"finding,\" and \"making off.\" This indicates that the dissimilar wordings may have been a result of a desire to avoid repetitive wording rather than any racial prejudice.", "Lack of contextual information": "The expert highlights that viewers are not privy to the contexts in which the photographs were taken. It is possible that the photographer who captured the black man actually witnessed him exiting an unattended grocery store with supplies, which could explain the use of the word \"looting\" in the caption. Without this contextual information, it is difficult to draw any concrete conclusions about racial prejudice.", "Overwhelming nature of disasters": "Lastly, the expert emphasizes that looting is a common occurrence during large-scale disasters when people are forced into survival mode and have to take supplies wherever they can find them. The lack of manpower to protect private property and the need for individuals to secure their own survival can contribute to looting, making it an unfortunate but inevitable result of such situations."}
