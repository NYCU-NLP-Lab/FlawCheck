{"President Joe Biden has used a family Bible dating back to 1893 throughout his career in public office": "This fact is supported by photographic evidence and Biden's own statement about the Bible being a family heirloom.", "The Bible used by Biden during his inauguration is not related to any secret society or organization": "including the Illuminati or freemasonry. Other fact-checkers have also debunked similar claims.", "The authenticity of the claim is further undermined by the inclusion of screenshots from a third": "party auction house website and a website claiming that the Haydock Douay-Rheims Bible, which Biden's family Bible is, contains information about the Illuminati. However, these screenshots do not provide credible evidence and can be seen as attempts to manipulate the narrative.", "The term": "Illuminati\" refers to a historical secret society that sought to infiltrate powerful institutions, while \"Masonic\" refers to freemasonry. Neither of these organizations have any connection to the Bible used by Biden, and their mention in relation to the claim can be seen as a tactic to fuel conspiracy theories."}
