{"The expert": "s statement: The expert, J. James Rohack, president of the American Medical Association, stated during an appearance on Fox News Sunday that pregnant women trying to buy health insurance on their own are barred from maternity coverage because they have a \"pre-existing condition.\" This statement serves as the primary source of the claim's authenticity.", "Endorsement by the American Medical Association": "The fact that the American Medical Association endorsed the House version of health care reform legislation in July supports the authenticity of the claim. This endorsement indicates that the claim aligns with the views and understanding of the medical community.", "Explanation of the individual market": "The expert explains that the claim specifically applies to the relatively small number of women who buy their health insurance through the individual market. This clarification helps verify the claim's authenticity by providing context and specificity about the affected population.", "State regulations and insurance practices": "The expert highlights that in 39 states, insurers have the ability to deny coverage for virtually any reason, including pre-existing conditions like pregnancy. This information, supported by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, validates the claim by demonstrating that state regulations and insurance practices contribute to the lack of maternity coverage for pregnant women in the individual market."}
