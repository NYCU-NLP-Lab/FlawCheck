{"The use of electrode stickers": "The expert mentions that in the video, the woman has placed two electrode stickers on the leaf of a sunflower plant. This aspect is employed to verify the authenticity of the claim as it demonstrates the method used to capture the supposed \"sounds\" made by the plant.", "Recording of electrical conductivity": "not noise: The expert points out that the electrodes did not record noise but rather electrical conductivity. This aspect is used to question the validity of the claim, as it suggests that the recorded sounds may not be directly produced by the plant but rather a result of computer software translating the electrical signals.", "Dubious websites": "interpretation: The expert highlights that dubious websites have taken the suggestion of plant sounds further and suggested that the audio signal represents some form of plant communication. This aspect is employed to discredit the claim, as it indicates that the interpretation of the recorded sounds as plant communication is not scientifically valid.", "Lack of scientific evidence": "The expert mentions that for the claim to be scientifically valid, three things would need to be true, namely: the device used to generate the recording must actually record the noise created by the plant, the noise presented in the video needs to be tied to an actual communication mechanism found in the sunflower, and sunflowers (or plants in general) need to be capable of both generating and receiving auditory cues. The expert concludes that the first statement is categorically false, and the latter two delve into theoretical and unverified areas of science. This aspect is employed to question the overall authenticity and scientific basis of the claim."}
