{"The behavior of lions and zebras in the wild": "The expert mentions that lions and zebras generally do not coexist peacefully in the wild, and their interactions often involve stalking, hunting, chasing, fighting, and eating behaviors.", "Captions and descriptions associated with the image": "The claim mentions that the image is frequently shared with captions such as \"unbelievable but true!\" and various other captions like \"It's not eating time,\" \"Alex and Marty,\" \"National Geographic: Behind the Scenes,\" and \"Morning Sam.\" These captions suggest that the image is being presented as a genuine moment of peace between a lion and a zebra.", "Origin and purpose of the image": "The expert reveals that the image was digitally created for a 2010 advertisement for Traveler's Insurance. The advertisement aimed to convey that Traveler's Insurance could make the world a safer place, even in situations where animals would normally be skittish at a watering hole.", "Lack of evidence for watering holes as safe spaces": "The expert points out that the idea of watering holes serving as neutral safe spaces for thirsty animals is not supported by much evidence. The concept may have originated from a passage in Rudyard Kipling's The Second Jungle Book, but it is not a widely observed phenomenon in the animal kingdom."}
