{"The claim misrepresents a year": "old comment from former Sen. Orrin Hatch.", "The meme circulating on social media falsely attributes the quote": "I don't care if Trump broke the law\" to Hatch.", "Hatch": "s actual statement was in response to allegations of Trump's involvement in paying hush money to two women, where he said, \"I don't care because I don't think he was involved in crimes.\"", "The exchange between CNN": "s Manu Raju and Hatch clearly shows that Hatch was referring to the Democrats' attempts to hurt the president and his belief that Trump was doing a good job, rather than expressing indifference towards potential crimes."}
