However, they did find that waivers were being issued for limited-benefit plans and coverages that were not meeting the new requirement to spend at least 80 percent of premiums on health benefits.", "The limited": "benefit plans referred to in Griffith's statement are primarily the \"mini-med\" plans popular at large employers with many part-time or low-wage workers, such as Wal-Mart and McDonald's. These plans often have annual limits on total payouts, and the new health-care reform law prohibits annual benefit limits starting in 2014.", "The health": "care reform law does provide an out for plans that cannot meet the new benefit limits without significantly increasing premiums. Insurers can seek waivers from regulators if they can demonstrate that the new caps would cause premiums to soar.
