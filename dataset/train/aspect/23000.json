{"The TikTok video claimed that skyrocketing unemployment is causing more deaths than the coronavirus": "This aspect was verified by analyzing the link between recessions and future deaths, which is a complex issue. The expert mentioned that the current unprecedented crisis makes predictions even more challenging.", "The video featured Steven Baker": "an Idaho chiropractor, who argued that the deaths witnessed in the country are not caused by the coronavirus but rather by the shutdown and its impact on the economy. This aspect was verified by examining the data on deaths of despair, including homicide, suicide, heart attacks, mental health issues, alcoholism, and drug use.", "Baker claimed to have heard the figure of 58": "000 additional deaths caused by the economy from a reliable source. This aspect was verified by tracing the source of Baker's claim, which was an opinion piece citing a researcher named Brenner. However, Brenner clarified that his work focused on the permanent loss of jobs and not an immediate rise in unemployment, making Baker's claim factually incorrect.", "Princeton economists Anne Case and Angus Deaton": "authors of the book \"Deaths of Despair and the Future of Capitalism,\" were mentioned to provide insights into deaths of despair among less educated white Americans. They stated that these deaths started in the 1990s and continued to rise before, during, and after the Great Recession, showing no perceptible effect of the collapse of the economy. This aspect was verified by referring to their op-ed and book, which support the argument that the economy does not have a significant impact on these specific deaths."}
