{"The Vatican": "s statement: The expert mentions that the Vatican released a page-long statement on December 21, 2020, assuring observant Catholics that it is morally acceptable for them to receive the coronavirus vaccine, despite its development using cells derived from aborted fetuses.", "Moral duty to protect health": "The Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of Faith emphasizes that in the face of the grave danger posed by the ongoing pandemic, Catholics have a moral duty to protect their own health. This implies that the Vatican considers the benefits of receiving the vaccine outweigh the moral concerns related to its development.", "Common good and vulnerable populations": "The Vatican also states that Catholics should act in the interest of the common good, which includes protecting the health of those most vulnerable to the virus. This suggests that the Vatican acknowledges the importance of preventing the further spread of the virus and ensuring the well-being of the community.", "No moral endorsement of cell lines from aborted fetuses": "The Vatican explicitly states that the use of vaccines developed using cell lines from aborted fetuses does not imply a moral endorsement of such use. This indicates that the Vatican distinguishes between the moral acceptability of receiving the vaccine and the moral implications of the vaccine's development process."}
