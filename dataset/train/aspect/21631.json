{"Rudy Giuliani": "s claim contradicts his own previous statements: The expert's verdict highlights how Giuliani's claim about no successful radical Islamic terrorist attacks during the eight years before Obama contradicts his previous statement about no domestic attacks under President George W. Bush, including the 9/11 attacks. This inconsistency undermines the authenticity of Giuliani's claim.", "Giuliani": "s claim ignores other successful attacks on U.S. soil: The expert's verdict points out that Giuliani's claim overlooks several successful attacks on U.S. soil, both those directly linked to jihad and others with murkier connections to radical Islamic extremism. This omission raises doubts about the accuracy and comprehensiveness of Giuliani's claim.", "Different definitions of terrorist attacks": "The expert's verdict explains that the definition of \"violent jihadist attacks\" used by organizations like the New America Foundation may not align with law enforcement classifications. This discrepancy in definitions can lead to a lack of clarity and understanding regarding the nature and motivation behind these attacks, further questioning the validity of Giuliani's claim.", "Ideological role in successful attacks": "The expert's verdict mentions the case of Hesham Mohamed Hadayet, who carried out a shooting at Los Angeles International Airport. While Hadayet's motive was linked to the terrorist organization Al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya, there are other instances where the connection to radical Islamic extremism is less clear. This highlights that the role of ideology in successful attacks on U.S. soil is complex and cannot be simplified, casting doubt on the accuracy of Giuliani's claim."}
