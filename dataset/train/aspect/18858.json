{"The photograph has been altered": "The expert's verdict states that the original image, which has been circulating since at least 2007, does not show the North Korean generals wearing medals on their sleeves or pants. This suggests that the claim's photograph has been manipulated.", "Lack of official photographs": "The expert mentions that they found no official photographs of North Korean generals wearing military accolades on their pants. This indicates that there is a lack of evidence to support the claim.", "Similar photograph from 1995": "The expert refers to a photograph from 1995 that shows a group of soldiers covered in a similar number of awards. This suggests that while the claim's photograph may be altered, there is some basis for soldiers in North Korea receiving a significant number of accolades.", "Military medals for non": "combat accomplishments: The expert mentions that military medals are frequently awarded for non-combat accomplishments. This challenges the insinuation made in the claim that the soldiers in the photograph do not deserve the medals they are displaying due to a lack of combat experience."}
