{"The claim is based on a letter to the editor of the Austin American": "Statesman, written by Ann Hudspeth, a volunteer with the Humane Society of the United States. The letter states that Texas leads the country in animal deaths by sodium cyanide M-44s and cites figures from the Humane Society of the United States to support this claim.", "The claim is also supported by a 2010 U": "S. Department of Agriculture leaflet from its Animal Health and Plant Inspection Service, which describes sodium cyanide M-44s as an effective and environmentally sound wildlife damage management tool. This leaflet provides information on how the device works and mentions that it is placed with the permission of ranchers and landowners by the agency's Wildlife Services branch.", "The claim is further backed by a 2012 Sacramento Bee news series": "which explains the history and purpose of the government agency responsible for predator and rodent control. This report highlights the efforts to exterminate wolves and control various wildlife species, including the use of sodium cyanide M-44s.", "Ann Hudspeth": "the author of the letter, claims to have based the claim on a data sheet from the Humane Society of the United States. Although the sheet is undated, it allegedly contains a chart indicating that in 2016, Texas ranked first among 14 states in terms of the number of animals killed by sodium cyanide M-44s."}
