This means that the information presented in the graphic may be selectively chosen to support a particular narrative, rather than providing a comprehensive and accurate representation of President Trump's accomplishments.", "The claim focuses on President Trump": "s accomplishments during his first four months in office, but it does not mention any major campaign promises that he has had difficulty keeping, such as instituting a Muslim immigration ban and building a wall on the Mexican border.
