{"The expert": "s verdict highlights that the claim made by Trump regarding the amount of money U.S. companies have in offshore accounts is an exaggeration. The expert mentions that Trump nearly doubled the figure mentioned in a White House fact sheet released on the same day.", "The expert acknowledges that U": "S. companies with business overseas do keep some profits in offshore accounts to avoid immediate U.S. corporate taxes until the money is repatriated. These profits are declared indefinitely or permanently reinvested, which allows the companies to claim that they will reinvest the money abroad.", "The Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy explains that if a U": "S. company decides to bring the money back to the United States, it would be subject to the U.S. tax rate of 35 percent minus a tax credit equal to the taxes paid to foreign governments.", "The expert questions the source of Trump": "s claim of $5 trillion, as the White House fact sheet mentions a figure of $2.6 trillion held offshore by Fortune 500 corporations. The expert reached out to both the White House and the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy for clarification but did not receive a response. The expert also consulted Audit Analytics, which reported $2.8 trillion in corporate profits indefinitely reinvested. Therefore, the expert concludes that the $5 trillion figure seems impossibly high and unsupported by available estimates."}
