{"The claim is based on a statement made by Attorney General Jeff Sessions": "who referred to a report from the Treasury Department's inspector general. Sessions claimed that the report found \"there's $4 billion a year in excess payments\" going to people who shouldn't receive them, specifically mentioning that \"these are mostly Mexicans.\"", "The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration conducted an audit in 2011": "which found that $4.2 billion in refundable tax credits were paid to individuals who were not authorized to work in the United States. These funds were claimed by a total of 2.3 million individuals using Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers (ITINs).", "The audit specifically focused on the Additional Child Tax Credit": "ACTC), which is available to individuals who owe less in taxes than the deductions for the Child Tax Credit. To claim this credit, a child must be a U.S. citizen or resident. The audit revealed that unauthorized individuals were able to claim this credit, resulting in the excess payments mentioned in the claim.", "While the claim suggests that the majority of these unauthorized individuals are Mexicans": "it is important to note that ITINs can also be issued to individuals who are legally present in the United States, such as foreign workers. Therefore, while there is truth to Sessions' claim, it leaves out the fact that not all ITIN filers are living in the country illegally."}
