{"Comparison of annual deficits under Republicans and monthly deficits under Democrats": "The expert analyzed the claim that the old annual deficits under Republicans have now become the monthly deficits under Democrats. They examined the numbers and found that the claim was based on cherry-picking data and comparing the highest monthly deficit under Democrats to one of the smaller deficits under Republicans.", "Average monthly deficit under Democrats": "The expert calculated the average monthly deficit under Democrats by considering the total 2010 deficit of $1.35 trillion and dividing it by 12 months. They argued that using the average is a fairer representation of the monthly deficits under Democrats, rather than focusing on the highest number.", "Evaluation of deficit trends": "The expert examined the deficit trends under both Republicans and Democrats. They pointed out that over George W. Bush's eight-year term, including a portion of the 2009 deficit, the country accumulated $3.3 trillion in total deficits. This analysis provided a broader perspective on the deficit situation and challenged the claim that the deficits under Democrats were solely responsible for the increase.", "Critique of partisan rhetoric": "The expert also commented on the partisan nature of the claim and the exchange between President Obama and Rep. Jeb Hensarling. They noted that the claim sounded more like a campaign talking point and highlighted the challenges of achieving bipartisan legislation. This aspect added context to the evaluation of the claim and its political implications."}
