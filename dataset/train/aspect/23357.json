{"Confirmation from police": "The expert consulted with the Station House Officer (SHO) Gurwinder Singh of Chattiwind police station, who confirmed that the suicide was unrelated to the train tragedy. The SHO stated that the man had been in depression for the past four months, indicating that the suicide was not connected to the Amritsar train accident.", "Media reports": "An article published by Dainik Jagran provided information about the person who committed suicide. The report stated that the body found hanging from a trap near Bohdu village was that of a resident from Bhikhwind, Tarn Tarn named Paramjeet, who was mentally ill. The police were investigating the case. This information from media reports contradicted the claim that the man in the viral photo was the train driver involved in the Amritsar tragedy.", "Social media posts": "Many social media users on Facebook and Twitter were sharing pictures and videos of the same incident with identical claims. The expert observed that the viral photo and video were being circulated with the caption suggesting that the man in the photo was the train driver involved in the Amritsar tragedy. The widespread sharing of these posts on social media platforms added to the authenticity verification process.", "Suicide note versus police statement": "The expert noted that the letter being shared along with the claim was not a suicide note but a statement given by the DMU driver (Arvind Kumar) to the police. This distinction indicated that the letter was not evidence of the driver's suicide but rather a statement related to the train accident."}
