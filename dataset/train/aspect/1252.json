{"The bill proposed by Sen": "Bill Cassidy and Sen. Lindsey Graham would establish a new \"block grant\" program for states, replacing funding provided under the Affordable Care Act.", "The current funding under the Affordable Care Act includes subsidies for purchasing plans on the ACA marketplace and an expansion of Medicaid access": "The Graham-Cassidy bill's approach could potentially lead to state-level cuts in funding.", "The bill does not authorize funding for the block grant beyond 2026": "creating a fiscal \"cliff\" after which funding could temporarily fall to zero. This uncertainty raises concerns about the sustainability of health insurance coverage.", "The formula used to determine the size of each state": "s block grant is more generous to states that did not expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, while states that did expand Medicaid may receive less funding under Graham-Cassidy. This disparity could have implications for coverage in different states."}
