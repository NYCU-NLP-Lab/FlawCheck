{"The claim states that Bill Nelson": "actually wrote the bipartisan law that makes it illegal to drill off Florida\u2019s coast.\"", "The legislation that was signed into law did not have Nelson": "s name on it, but it was clear that Nelson's bill (co-sponsored with a Republican) was the inspiration for the law.", "Nelson and former Florida Republican Sen": "Mel Martinez cosponsored the Permanent Protection for Florida Act of 2006 (S.2239), which aimed to prohibit offshore drilling near Florida.", "Although Nelson and Martinez": "s bill did not get a hearing or become law, similar ideas were included in the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 (S.3711), which enacted a moratorium on drilling."}
