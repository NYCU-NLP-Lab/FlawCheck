{"The church is not removing the plaques": "but relocating them, as they made the decision to move both plaques together because they were installed together.", "The decision to relocate the plaques was primarily based on the reaction to the Robert E": "Lee plaque, not the George Washington plaque.", "The church leaders stated that the plaques were making some people feel unsafe or unwelcome": "and that the prominent presence of the plaques might be discouraging parishioners from attending services.", "The decision to consider both the George Washington and Robert E": "Lee plaques together was based on the fact that they were erected at the same time and visually balanced each other, maintaining the symmetry of the sanctuary."}
