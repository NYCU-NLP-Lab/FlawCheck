{"The Facebook post claims that the Greens signed the Native Forest Protection Act to defund National Park Rangers and control burn programs": "2. The government did not pass a law called the Native Forest Protection Act, as verified by a search on the Federal Register of Legislation and the Parliament of Australia's website.", "The misleading post includes a photo of the agreement being signed between the ALP and the Greens in 2010": "but the photo does not support the claim of defunding National Park Rangers and control burn programs.", "The Native Forest Protection Bill": "which was introduced in Parliament in 1996, did not propose any cuts to national park rangers or control burn programs."}
