{"Lack of authority": "The expert points out that at the time of the alleged arrest, former President Donald Trump did not have the authority to direct any federal departments or branches of the country's armed forces, including the Navy SEALs. This casts doubt on the claim's authenticity.", "Lack of evidence": "The expert highlights that there is no evidence to support any of the claims made in the post regarding Hillary Clinton's arrest. Without solid evidence, the claim cannot be verified.", "Unreliable source": "The expert mentions that the claim originated from a website called \"Real Raw News,\" which is not a credible news outlet. The website's reputation and lack of credibility raise doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Lack of media coverage": "The expert points out that if such a significant event had occurred, it is unlikely that \"Real Raw News\" would be the first to report it.
