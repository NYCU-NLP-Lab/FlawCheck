{"The claim made by President": "elect Joe Biden and Georgia U.S. Senate candidates Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock was that winning both Georgia races would allow the immediate passage of \"$2,000 checks\" for COVID-19 relief.", "The promises of": "2,000 per person stimulus checks were made multiple times by Biden, Ossoff, and Warnock during the lead-up to the Jan. 5, 2021, Georgia Senate runoff election.", "Biden": "s plan, unveiled on Jan. 20, included $1,400 checks instead of the promised $2,000. However, this was explained as the addition of $1,400 to the already distributed $600 checks, fulfilling the campaign promise of $2,000 per person COVID-19 stimulus payments.", "The issue of increasing COVID": "19 stimulus payments from $600 to $2,000 per person became a major campaign pitch in the Georgia Senate run-off elections, with the claim that a blue (Democrat-controlled) U.S. Senate would ensure the passage of those $2,000 checks."}
