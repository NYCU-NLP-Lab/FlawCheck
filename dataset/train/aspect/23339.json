{"The claim states that a defense bill includes language that would require military hospitals to provide abortions on demand": "2. The Department of Defense is currently prohibited from spending federal funds on abortions, except in cases where the life of the mother is in danger or in cases of rape or incest, which must be paid for by the woman herself.", "In 1993": "President Bill Clinton signed a memorandum allowing abortions at military facilities if they were paid for with private funds. However, in 1996, Republicans imposed current limits on abortions in military facilities.", "In May": "Senator Roland Burris introduced an amendment to the defense authorization bill for fiscal year 2011 that would repeal the restrictions on privately-funded abortions in military facilities. The amendment does not compel doctors to perform these procedures but removes the language prohibiting these health services from being offered on military bases."}
