{"The use of the": "net imports\" figure: The expert mentions that the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) uses a \"net imports\" figure to measure U.S. dependence on foreign oil. This figure compares the amount of oil produced in the U.S. with the amount of oil consumed in the U.S. It is stated that the U.S. produced an amount equal to 50.7 percent of what it consumed, and imports fell to 49.3 percent of what the U.S. consumed in 2010. This aspect verifies the claim made by President Obama.", "Comparison with previous years": "The expert mentions that the net import percentage hasn't been as low as 49.3 percent since 1997. It peaked in 2005 at 60.3 percent and has steadily decreased every year since. This aspect provides historical context and supports the claim that imports accounted for less than half of what the U.S. consumed for the first time in over a decade.", "Consideration of exported oil": "The expert acknowledges that the U.S. doesn't use all of the oil it produces and some of it is exported. This aspect highlights the fact that the U.S. oil goes where suppliers can make the most profit on it. However, it is not directly related to verifying the claim about imports accounting for less than half of what the U.S. consumed.", "Petroleum consumption data": "The expert mentions that looking strictly at the petroleum consumed by the U.S. last year, 61.2 percent of it was imported according to EIA data. This aspect contradicts the claim made by President Obama, as the percentage of imported oil is much higher than the \"less than half\" figure cited by him."}
