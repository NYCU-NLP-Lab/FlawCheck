{"Comparison of unemployment figures": "The expert analyzed the official numbers produced by the Bureau of Labor Statistics to compare the number of unemployed individuals in January 2009 and November 2014. The data showed that the claim of 2.3 million people out of work when Obama took office and 5 million-plus out of work five-plus years later was inaccurate. The actual trend indicated a decline in the number of unemployed Americans since Obama took office.", "Examination of different time frames": "The expert also considered different time frames to ensure the accuracy of the claim. They looked at the weakest point of Obama's tenure in October 2009, where the number of unemployed Americans was even higher than the claim suggested. Additionally, they explored the possibility that the meme was created earlier in 2014, but this did not change the overall picture of declining unemployment.", "Analysis of broader measurements": "To account for the possibility of a different definition of \"out of work,\" the expert examined expanded measures. They considered various struggling groups, such as those who were working part-time but desired full-time employment, discouraged workers, and marginally attached workers. However, even with these expanded measures, the claim of 5 million-plus out of work was found to be inaccurate.", "Verification of official data sources": "The expert relied on the official data provided by the Bureau of Labor Statistics to verify the authenticity of the claim. By using reliable and authoritative sources, they ensured that the information used to evaluate the claim was accurate and unbiased."}
