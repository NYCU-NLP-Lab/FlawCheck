{"The claim is based on a report by the libertarian Cato Institute titled": "Fiscal Policy Report Card on America's Governors 2014\", which attempted to compare 48 governors on various fiscal measures.", "The Cato Institute report gave Kasich a score of 44": "which was translated to a D grade. This score was based on an overall assessment of fiscal measures, including spending changes.", "In the specific subcategory of spending changes": "Kasich ranked last among all governors, with a total score of six. This was based on the growth in per capita spending proposed and the actual growth in per capita spending in Ohio.", "The spending measures cited in the report were specifically focused on the general fund budgets": "which are the budgets that governors have the most control over. The proposed and actual per capita spending figures were measured through fiscal year 2015 and fiscal year 2014, respectively."}
