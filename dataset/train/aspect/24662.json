This distinction is important as charges do not necessarily equate to guilt or criminal activity.", "The claim exaggerates the number of illegal immigrants booked": "The expert's verdict states that Trump exaggerates the number of illegal immigrants booked into Texas jails between 2011 and 2016. While most of the arrested individuals were identified as being illegally in the country, not all of them were.", "The claim uses data on": "criminal aliens,\" not just illegal immigrants: The expert's verdict highlights that the data Trump cites refers to \"criminal aliens,\" which includes any immigrant charged with a crime, not just illegal immigrants. This distinction is important as it broadens the scope beyond just those who are in the country illegally."}
