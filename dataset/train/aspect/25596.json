{"The claim is accompanied by three images": "which are analyzed to determine their authenticity. The first image is found to be a thumbnail used on Fox News TV reports on an anti-Trump protest in New Mexico in 2016, not related to the caravan of immigrants. The second image is a stock image taken by a Getty Images photographer during a protest in London in 2010. The third image shows protesters burning the American flag outside the Republican National Convention in 2016.", "The photos used in the claim are not from Mexico": "where the migrants are currently heading, but from unrelated events in different locations and time periods. This raises doubts about the accuracy of the claim.", "The expert mentions that there haven": "t been credible reports of other instances of flag-burnings connected to the caravan, nor any stories of migrants burning the American flag themselves during their march north. This lack of evidence undermines the credibility of the claim.", "The expert concludes that the post misuses old": "unrelated photos of flag-burnings to wrongly feed fears of an invasion. This suggests that the claim is intentionally spreading misinformation and manipulating emotions."}
