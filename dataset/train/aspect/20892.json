This indicates that the claim has been used for promotional purposes, potentially adding to its perceived authenticity.", "Viral video and associated mythology": "The expert's verdict mentions a viral video that garnered over one million views, claiming that the \"haiku bird\" was the pet of a Hindu deity and had immortal characteristics. The inclusion of mythology and viral content adds an element of intrigue and fascination to the claim.", "Identification of the source as an art doll": "The expert's verdict conclusively states that the photographs of the \"haiku bird\" actually depict a posable art doll created by Deviant Artist CMWyvern. The artist herself provided a description of the doll and refuted rumors that it was a real-life creature or a Pokemon.
