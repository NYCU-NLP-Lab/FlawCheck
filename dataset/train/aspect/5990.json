{"The claim incorrectly states the starting and current diesel prices under President Biden": "s administration. The national average price for diesel on January 20th was $2.64, almost a dollar lower than the claim suggests. The March 10th national average was $3.04, also lower than the claim.", "Weekly price data from the U": "S. Energy Information Administration shows a similar movement in diesel prices, from $2.70 to $3.14, based on the weeks closest to the claim's timeframe. This data contradicts the claim's exaggerated price increase.", "The claim": "s author did not provide evidence to support their assertion. Despite living in Iowa, where diesel prices rose slightly more than the national average, the increase was still far from the claim's exaggerated jump.", "Experts confirm that the rise in diesel prices predates President Biden": "s administration. Diesel prices have been steadily increasing since November when former President Donald Trump was in office. Additionally, Biden's policies, such as shutting down the Keystone XL pipeline expansion, are not expected to have an immediate impact on diesel prices."}
