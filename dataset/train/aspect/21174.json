{"Comparison to previous election": "The expert's verdict includes a comparison of voter turnout rates for Hispanic and African American registered voters in Texas between the 2000 and 2012 general elections. This comparison helps to verify the claim by showing an increase in voter participation among these groups over time.", "Reference to Census Bureau report": "The expert's verdict mentions a May 2013 census bureau report titled \"The Diversifying Electorate\u2014Voting Rates by Race and Hispanic Origin in 2012 (and Other Recent Elections).\" This report provides data on voter turnout rates for different racial and ethnic groups in presidential elections from 1996 to 2012. The reference to this report helps to authenticate the claim by citing a reliable source of information.", "Lack of voter tracking by ethnicity": "The expert's verdict acknowledges that the state of Texas does not track voters by ethnicity and that 2012 voter exit polls in the state were not extensive enough to generate estimates for Latino and African American voter turnout. This aspect highlights the difficulty in determining precise numbers but also suggests that the claim may be based on available data.", "Skepticism and request for verification": "The expert's verdict mentions a Democratic activist and blogger who expressed skepticism about the 2012 voter turnout percentages mentioned in the claim. This aspect shows that there are individuals who question the accuracy of the claim and highlights the importance of verifying the information through reliable sources."}
