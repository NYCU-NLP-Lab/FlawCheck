This comparison formed the basis of the claim verification.", "Analysis of four factors": "The expert, along with Laffer and Moore, analyzed four factors to measure the performance of the states: population, Gross State Product (GSP), employment, and state and local tax revenue. These factors were used to assess the economic growth and success of the states in question.", "Performance of states without income tax": "The analysis conducted by Laffer and Moore showed that the nine states without an income tax outperformed the high-tax states in terms of population growth, GSP, employment, and state and local tax revenue. This performance was used as evidence to support the claim.", "Criticism of the study": "s measures: Dick Lavine, a senior fiscal analyst, criticized the measures used by Laffer and Moore, stating that fast-growing states tend to look good mainly due to population growth rather than any excellence in the economy.
