{"The proposed legislation in Missouri aims to narrow the acceptable forms of voter ID to non": "expired photo identification issued by the state or federal government, excluding currently acceptable forms like student IDs, out-of-state driver\u2019s licenses, or bank statements and utility bills.", "State Rep": "Kip Kendrick claims that requiring photo ID would prevent approximately 200,000 Missourians from voting.", "Missouri Secretary of State Jason Kander": "s report, cited by Kendrick, shows that approximately 220,000 people could potentially be disenfranchised by the photo ID requirements. This estimate was derived by comparing the list of registered voters in Missouri to the Department of Revenue's accounting of those without driver's licenses (around 150,000) and those with expired driver's licenses (around 70,000).", "The proposed legislation": "s fiscal note mentions an even higher estimate of almost 400,000 Missourians without non-expired photo identification. This estimate is used to allocate up to $10.7 million for providing new photo IDs, as the state would be unable to implement the requirements without funding. However, Kander's report, which Kendrick based his estimate on, does not take this information into account and is two years old, referring to an older bill that did not require the state to bear the cost of providing support."}
