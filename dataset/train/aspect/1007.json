{"The leak was confirmed by TC Energy": "the company that operates the Keystone pipeline, which estimated that approximately 9,120 barrels of oil leaked in North Dakota in late October 2019 before the pipeline was shut down.", "The claim was verified by multiple reputable sources": "including the Associated Press, The New York Times, and Snopes. The Mind Unleashed, the conspiracy site that initially reported the story, sourced its information from the Associated Press.", "The leak occurred in the existing Keystone pipeline system": "not the controversial Keystone XL pipeline. Karl Rockeman, director of the North Dakota Department of Environmental Quality\u2019s division of water quality, clarified that the spill was not related to the Keystone XL pipeline, which has been the subject of environmental protests.", "This incident was not the first major incident for the Keystone pipeline system": "In 2017, a significant spill occurred in South Dakota, and there were also smaller spills in North Dakota in 2011 and South Dakota in 2016. This history of leaks adds credibility to the claim of the recent oil leak in North Dakota."}
