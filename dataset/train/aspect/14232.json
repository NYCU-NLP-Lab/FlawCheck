{"Comparison with past impeachments": "The expert's verdict states that the claim was analyzed by comparing the rights given to Republicans in the current impeachment inquiry with those given to Democrats in the impeachment proceedings of Presidents Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton.", "Number of lawmakers involved": "The expert's verdict highlights that the claim revolves around the number of lawmakers involved in the impeachment inquiry. It is stated that the current resolution focuses on two committees (Intelligence and Judiciary), whereas in past impeachments, all the action was in the House Judiciary Committee.", "Power to call witnesses and ask questions": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim also considers the power of Republicans to call witnesses and ask them questions. It is stated that the House resolution and the rules set by the Judiciary Committee provide Republicans with equal time to question witnesses, with more detail than in the Nixon and Clinton House resolutions.", "Loss of participation for certain committees": "The expert's verdict points out that while the claim is accurate in terms of the number of lawmakers involved and the power to question witnesses, it also highlights that under the current resolution, several other committees will play smaller roles. This means that Republicans on committees such as Oversight and Foreign Affairs, who were able to participate when key witnesses testified, will lose that opportunity."}
