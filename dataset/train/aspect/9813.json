{"The expert turned to Gretchen Livingston": "a senior researcher at the Pew Research Center, who provided U.S. Census data showing that in 1960, about 65 percent of black children under 18 were living in households with two married parents, supporting the claim that \"most\" black children were raised in two-parent, married families at that time.", "The expert also consulted figures from the U": "S. Census Bureau, which showed that in 2012, 34 percent of black children were living with two married parents, contradicting the claim that only 20 percent of black children were raised in two-parent, monogamous families.", "The expert considered the argument made by E": "W. Jackson, the Republican nominee for lieutenant governor, that the expansion of welfare programs in the 1960s contributed to the deterioration of black families. However, the expert also highlighted that other factors, such as changes in economic opportunities for women and men, have played a role in the decline of marriage rates and the increase in single-parent households.", "The expert mentioned that Gregory Aldridge": "Jackson's campaign manager, referred to a chart by the conservative Heritage Foundation, which showed that less than 20 percent of black babies in the 1950s were born to single mothers, and this figure rose to 72.3 percent in 2008. However, the expert pointed out that these figures did not specifically address the percentage of black children \"raised\" in two-parent, married families, as some single mothers may later marry and raise their children in two-parent homes."}
