{"The claim was made by Rush Limbaugh on his radio program": "where he stated that the government would have the right to access individuals' bank accounts and make transfers without their knowledge.", "The claim was also included in a widely circulated chain email that contained numerous distortions about the health care bill": "3. The provision in question is found in Section 163 of the House bill (page 59) under the heading \"Administrative Simplification.\" It sets out goals for standardizing electronic health records and transactions between insurance companies and health care providers.", "Experts": "such as Edwin Park from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and the organization Health Care for America Now, argue that the provision does not grant the government access to individual bank accounts. Instead, it aims to establish standards for electronic communication and transfers of money within the government."}
