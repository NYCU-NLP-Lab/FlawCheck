{"Denial of involvement by the National Research Council of Canada": "NRC): The NRC explicitly stated that they have not conducted any research on the effectiveness of Vicks VapoRub on nighttime coughs. They denied endorsing the claim and dispelled the suggestion.", "Lack of research on alternative applications": "The NRC mentioned that they rarely engage in research on alternate applications of medications. They focus more on medical and pharmaceutical treatments for illness and disease. This indicates that they have not conducted any studies specifically on the use of Vicks VapoRub on the soles of children's feet.", "Home remedy popularity": "The NRC acknowledged that home remedies, homeopathy, and alternative therapies are popular areas of interest for Canadians, but they clarified that their research focus is primarily on medical and pharmaceutical treatments. This implies that the claim may have gained traction due to the popularity of home remedies rather than scientific evidence.", "Previous mention in": "The People's Pharmacy\": The claim of using Vicks VapoRub on the soles of children's feet to alleviate nighttime coughs was mentioned in a 2002 book called \"Guide to Unique Uses for Vicks\" by Joe and Teresa Graedon. This suggests that the claim had been circulating in the health industry prior to the viral email in 2007."}
