{"Lack of credible publication records": "The expert found no evidence of Senator Marco Rubio uttering the specific phrases mentioned in the claim in any credible publication. This lack of recorded statements raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Source of the meme": "The meme containing the quotes was originally posted on a Facebook page known for creating fake quotes and attributing them to politicians. This raises suspicions about the reliability and accuracy of the information presented in the meme.", "Satirical nature of the Facebook group": "The Facebook group that originally posted the meme had a disclaimer stating that its content was primarily satire and parody. This suggests that the quotes may have been created for entertainment purposes rather than reflecting actual statements made by Senator Rubio.", "Inconsistent position on gun control": "The expert found conflicting statements regarding Senator Rubio's stance on felons owning guns. While the quote in the claim suggests that he supports felons owning guns, a spokesperson for Rubio mentioned that he was open to gun control measures to keep weapons out of the hands of criminals. This inconsistency raises questions about the accuracy of the claim and its representation of Senator Rubio's political stance."}
