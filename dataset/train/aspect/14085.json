{"The expert analyzed the specific plan proposed by Congressman Ryan": "known as A Roadmap for America's Future, which aimed to eliminate taxes on interest, dividends, and long-term capital gains.", "The expert considered the fact that Ryan": "s plan did not gain enough support and did not pass in Congress, indicating that it did not become law and therefore would not have directly affected Romney's tax rate.", "The expert referenced other sources": "such as Roll Call and the Atlantic, which reported that Ryan's plan would have resulted in Romney paying a tax rate of 1 percent or less, based on his 2010 tax return.", "The expert mentioned Romney": "s own statement during a debate where he criticized a similar proposal by Newt Gingrich, which would have resulted in him paying no taxes in the last two years. This statement suggests that Romney himself acknowledged the potential for a very low tax rate under certain tax reform plans."}
