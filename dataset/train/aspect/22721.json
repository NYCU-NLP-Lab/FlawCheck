{"Confirmation from Starbucks": "The company confirmed via email that the claim made in the meme about the new shatter-proof windows and the contest was false. This direct confirmation from the company itself adds credibility to the verdict.", "Lack of reported damage": "The expert mentions that even before the incident in 2018, Starbucks had taken precautions against vandalism at its flagship roastery in Philadelphia. During the May Day protests in 2018, the roastery did not report any damage. This lack of reported damage suggests that the claim about the shatter-proof windows and the contest is likely false.", "Context of the image": "The expert mentions that the image circulated shortly before Starbucks temporarily closed all of their U.S. locations to train their employees on recognizing racial bias. This context implies that the image and the claim about the contest were likely created to capitalize on the negative publicity surrounding the arrest of two black men at a Philadelphia Starbucks. The timing and motive behind the image cast doubt on its authenticity.", "Source credibility": "The expert provides information about themselves, stating that Arturo Garcia is a former writer for Snopes. This mention of the source's background and affiliation with a reputable fact-checking organization adds credibility to the expert's verdict and the information provided."}
