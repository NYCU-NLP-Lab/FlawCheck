{"Growing body of evidence": "The expert's verdict mentions that there is a growing body of evidence showing that wearing a mask, even a cloth mask, can reduce transmission of COVID-19. This suggests that scientific research and studies support the effectiveness of masks in preventing the spread of the virus.", "Reputable sources vs": "unreputable sources: The expert's verdict highlights that State Rep. Michael Schraa shared links to unreputable sources that found masks ineffective, while leading medical journals, federal and world health officials, research universities, and even President Donald Trump have stated that masks do work to cut down transmission. This comparison between reputable and unreputable sources helps verify the authenticity of the claim.", "Mask mandates": "The expert's verdict mentions that on July 30, 2020, Gov. Tony Evers issued a statewide mask order, indicating that government officials have recognized the importance of wearing masks to control the spread of the virus. This implementation of mask mandates supports the effectiveness of masks.", "Criticism and debunked claims": "The expert's verdict states that opponents of mask mandates argue that masks endanger personal freedoms, can cause carbon dioxide poisoning (which has been debunked by scientists), and that some types of face coverings won't stop transmission of the coronavirus. This criticism and the subsequent debunking of these claims further reinforce the effectiveness of masks in preventing the spread of the virus."}
