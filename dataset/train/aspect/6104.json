{"The video in question was circulated with a comment claiming that it depicted Muslims in Chicago chanting": "Free Palestine, death to Israel, death to America.\" This comment was used as evidence to support the claim.", "The video was from July 2014": "not March 2016, indicating that it was not recent and therefore not relevant to the claim being made.", "The description of the video stated that it depicted a protest in downtown Chicago where Palestinian supporters were protesting the bombings in Gaza": "rather than Muslims chanting \"death to America.\" This contradicts the claim being made.", "Claims that the video received no mainstream media attention were easily disproven": "as videos of the event were readily available through sources such as the Chicago Tribune, Chicago's ABC affiliate WLS-TV, the Chicago Monitor, and CNN's iReport. This suggests that the claim of the mainstream media suppressing the video is false."}
