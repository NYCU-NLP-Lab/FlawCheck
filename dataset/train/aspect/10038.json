{"The claim is based on a misinterpretation of a news release that refers to Dominion Energy Services": "Inc., which is unrelated to Dominion Voting Systems.", "It is true that Bill Barr was elected to serve on the board of directors of Dominion Energy": "but he resigned from that position when he became the U.S. Attorney General in February 2019.", "Dominion Energy": "Inc. owns several subsidiaries, but Dominion Voting Services is not one of them, according to their most recent SEC filings.", "There is no connection": "even an out-of-date one, between Bill Barr and Dominion Voting Systems. The claim is therefore false."}
