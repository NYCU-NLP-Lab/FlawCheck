{"Lack of national statistics": "The expert consulted Switzerland\u2019s national statistics bureau and found that there are no official statistics on the number of guns in the country due to its federal structure. Each canton is responsible for issuing weapons permits and keeping track of these numbers independently.", "Estimate from research center": "The Small Arms Survey, a reputable research center, estimated in 2017 that there were around 2.3 million firearms in circulation in Switzerland. This estimation indicates a high rate of gun ownership in the country, but it does not mean that every citizen possesses a firearm.", "Military service and gun possession": "Swiss men over the age of 18 undergo basic military training and remain part of a national \"militia\" until they are around 30. During this time, they keep their unloaded service weapons at home. After their service ends, they have the choice to keep their personal weapon if they acquire a permit. Women can also volunteer for national service.", "Permit requirements for purchasing guns": "Individuals who would like to purchase a gun in Switzerland need a permit issued by authorities in their canton. These permits are available to Swiss citizens and permanent residents over the age of 18, provided they have no history of violent or repeated crime and do not suffer from a mental illness that poses a danger to themselves or others. The permit requirements can be found on the Swiss government's website."}
