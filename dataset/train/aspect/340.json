{"The video has been circulating on social media for several years": "indicating that it is not a recent incident and may not be related to the claim of a Hindu woman being lynched in Madhya Pradesh for attending church.", "The video was fact": "checked by Alt News in 2017 and found to be from Guatemala in South America, where a woman was lynched for allegedly murdering a cab driver. This suggests that the video is not related to the claim being made.", "The claim has been shared with different narratives in the past": "including one about a Marwari woman who was allegedly lynched for refusing to wear a burqa. This indicates a pattern of false claims being attached to the video.", "The video was shared by multiple individual users on social media and likely circulated on WhatsApp": "indicating a widespread dissemination of false information. This highlights the need for caution when encountering such content on social media."}
