{"The claim suggests that under the Affordable Care Act": "some people were able to receive three months of free insurance by paying for nine months. This aspect of the claim highlights the alleged loophole in the law that allows beneficiaries to stop paying premiums after nine months and then sign up for a new plan without penalty.", "The expert": "s investigation found no direct evidence of people intentionally gaming the system in this way, and even the maximum number of individuals who could theoretically be doing this represents a small proportion of the law's beneficiaries. This aspect emphasizes the lack of concrete evidence supporting the claim and suggests that the alleged loophole may not be widely exploited.", "Representative Greg Walden": "who chairs the House Energy and Commerce Committee, also echoed this point during a news conference on March 7. This aspect highlights the fact that the claim gained traction among some Republicans and was further promoted by a prominent political figure."}
