{"Lack of evidence supporting the claim": "The expert's verdict states that there is no evidence, beyond a vague resemblance, to suggest that the photograph features Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal. The lack of concrete evidence weakens the authenticity of the claim.", "Absence of an official origin trail": "The photograph does not have any official origin trail. It is not archived by reputable news photo outlets like Getty Images or the Associated Press, and it is not found in any galleries covering Barack Obama's college years. This absence raises doubts about the credibility of the claim.", "Third": "hand information from an anonymous Reddit user: The expert's verdict mentions that the earliest posting of the image came from a Reddit discussion in 2013. The user who shared the photograph claimed to have received it around 2008 from a friend who obtained it from their drug dealer's father, who allegedly knew Obama. However, this third-hand information is not enough to confirm the context of the photograph or the identity of the individuals in it, casting doubt on the claim's authenticity.", "Manipulation and conspiracy theories": "The expert's verdict highlights that the photograph gained attention in September 2018 when a \"Qanon\" conspiracy theorist shared a version of the image with one man's face obscured. This led to various speculations about the identity of the masked man, including baseless theories about Michelle Obama, the Muslim brotherhood, a murdered boyfriend, or Christine Blasey Ford's uncle. The involvement of conspiracy theories and manipulation further undermines the credibility of the claim."}
