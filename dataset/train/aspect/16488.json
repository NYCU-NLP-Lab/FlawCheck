This suggests that Clinton was not asleep during the attack.", "Clinton": "s statement and actions: The expert's verdict mentions that Clinton released a public statement after 10 p.m. and emailed her daughter, Chelsea, after 11 p.m. on the night of the attack. This contradicts the claim that she was soundly sleeping during that time.", "Military responsibility": "The expert's verdict states that the military, not the State Department, was in charge of responding to the attacks as they unfolded. Congressional investigations concluded that the military did the best it could on the night of the attack with the resources available. This suggests that Clinton's actions or sleep patterns would not have significantly impacted the outcome of the attack."}
