{"Comparison of apprehensions": "The expert's verdict mentions that the decrease in illegal immigration was determined by comparing the number of apprehensions at the southwest border in March 2017 (12,193) to the number of apprehensions in March 2016 (33,316). This year-over-year reduction of 63.4% was used to support the claim of a 64% reduction in illegal immigration.", "Change in measuring method": "The expert's verdict highlights that President Trump changed the way he calculated the decrease in illegal immigration. Instead of looking at the decrease from February 2017 to March 2017, as he did previously, he focused on the year-over-year reduction. This change in measuring method allowed him to select the number that showed the biggest decrease.", "Emphasis on progress": "The expert's verdict mentions that President Trump is changing how he counts the decrease in illegal immigration to emphasize progress. This suggests that the administration is selectively choosing data that supports their claim of a significant reduction.", "Caution against early conclusions": "The expert's verdict also cautions against drawing early conclusions about the effect of President Trump's policies on illegal immigration. While experts acknowledge that Trump's rhetoric and tough immigration stance may have contributed to the decreases, they advise against making definitive judgments about the impact of his policies."}
