{"The claim was based on an article published by Pagez": "com, which stated that the cast of The Office would return for a new season in 2018. This article was later retracted by Pagez.com, admitting that they were fooled by an April Fools joke and had published the story without proper verification.", "The claim also referenced an Instagram post from actress Jenna Fischer": "which supposedly called out the crew to get back together and shoot. However, the post was actually from February 2017, not \"this week\" as alleged by the September 2017 article. This suggests that the claim was not based on up-to-date or accurate information.", "The expert": "s verdict also mentioned that the claim was based on two other posts, an April Fool's Day joke on Medium.com and Jenna Fischer's Instagram post. These posts did not provide any confirmation of the cast reuniting for a new season. This suggests that the claim may have been based on unreliable or misleading sources."}
