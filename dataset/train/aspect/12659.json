{"Legislative records": "The expert examined the legislative records of the Democratic lawmakers mentioned in the claim, specifically focusing on the number of bills they introduced and how many passed.", "Verification through GovTrack": "The expert relied on GovTrack, a website that tracks congressional legislation, to gather accurate information about the lawmakers' records. This source provided data on the bills introduced and passed by each senator.", "Discrepancies in numbers": "The expert noted that while the claim's numbers were close, there were slight discrepancies between the claim and the information obtained from GovTrack. This raised the possibility that the claim may have used a different source or counted bills differently.", "Critique of bill sponsorship as a measure of effectiveness": "The expert highlighted the viewpoint of Norman Ornstein, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, who questioned the validity of using the number of bills sponsored as a measure of a lawmaker's effectiveness. Ornstein argued that much legislation is now passed through omnibus bills and amendments, making bill sponsorship a limited and questionable indicator."}
