{"The claim states that": "19.5 million in Oregon Lottery funds were used to secure the new NOAA Marine Operations Center-Pacific in Newport. This aspect is verified through the statement from Business Oregon, the state's main economic development arm, which confirms that the Port of Newport was able to make the winning pitch largely because of the $19.5 million in Oregon Lottery funds appropriated by the state Legislature.", "The claim is supported by a news report in The Oregonian": "which confirms that Newport officials called state Sen. Betsy Johnson to help secure the lottery funds for the deal. This aspect verifies the involvement of state officials in securing the funds for the NOAA facility.", "The claim mentions that Newport was one of four bidders": "with the other three in Washington. This aspect is verified by the statement that NOAA awarded the Port of Newport the lease because it had the highest technically-rated and lowest-priced offer. This confirms the competitive bidding process and Newport's successful bid.", "The claim raises the question of whether it is fair for the Oregon Lottery to claim unbridled credit for the economic activity brought by the NOAA facility": "This aspect is supported by the response of state Sen. Betsy Johnson, who states that the Lottery statement is accurate on one level but lacks nuance. This verifies the existence of differing opinions on the extent of the Lottery's credit for the economic activity."}
