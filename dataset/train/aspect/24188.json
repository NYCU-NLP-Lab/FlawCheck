{"Lack of evidence": "The expert points out that the claim provides scant evidence to support the accusation that McCain collaborated with the enemy. This lack of evidence undermines the authenticity of the claim.", "Contradicting accounts": "The expert highlights that interviews with other POWs, the author of a McCain biography, and McCain's own accounts strongly contradict the claim. These contradictory accounts cast doubt on the authenticity of the claim.", "Expert testimony": "The expert references Robert Timberg, the author of a McCain biography, who states that there is no evidence of McCain collaborating with the North Vietnamese. This expert testimony further undermines the authenticity of the claim.", "McCain": "s own actions: The expert mentions that McCain, like other POWs, submitted to severe torture and wrote confessions under duress.
