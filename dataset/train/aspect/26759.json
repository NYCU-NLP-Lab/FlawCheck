{"Planned Parenthood": "s focus on preventive services: The expert took into account Planned Parenthood's claim that 90 percent of its services are preventive in nature. This includes contraception, sexually transmitted infections testing and treatment, and cancer screening and prevention. This aspect indicates that the organization's primary focus is on providing preventive healthcare services rather than solely performing abortions.", "Comparison of services": "The expert compared the number of abortion procedures performed by Planned Parenthood (332,278) to the total number of services provided (11,383,900) in 2009. By this comparison, abortions accounted for approximately 2.9 percent of the total services, further supporting the claim that abortion services make up a small percentage of what Planned Parenthood does.", "Fungibility argument": "The expert considered the argument made by opponents of abortion that any funding provided to Planned Parenthood indirectly supports abortions because money is fungible. However, the expert noted that the federal funding given to Planned Parenthood is legally prohibited from being spent on abortion services. This aspect adds to the authenticity of the claim that abortion services are a small fraction of what Planned Parenthood does."}
