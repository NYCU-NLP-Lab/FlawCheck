{"The official unemployment rate": "calculated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, was 8.5 percent in December 2011, which translates to approximately 13.1 million unemployed Americans.", "The BLS also provides an alternative measure known as": "U-6\" that takes into account individuals who have stopped looking for work or who are working part-time but would prefer full-time employment. This measure identified an additional 2.6 million \"marginally attached\" individuals and 8.1 million part-time workers who desired full-time jobs.", "When combining the official unemployment rate with the": "U-6\" measure, the total number of individuals who could be considered as not fully employed was approximately 23.8 million in September 2011, slightly lower than Romney's claim of 25 million.", "While it is valid to consider the": "U-6\" measure alongside other statistics, describing all 25 million individuals as \"out of work\" may be a stretch since a significant portion of them are actually working part-time for economic reasons. Therefore, the statement is rated as Half True."}
