{"The similarity to a previous real robbery scam": "The expert's verdict mentions that the September 2019 scam alert resembled an official South African government warning about a real robbery scam that occurred in South Africa in October 2017 and April 2019. This similarity suggests that the claim may have some basis in truth.", "Lack of relevance to other countries": "The expert's verdict states that the warning had no relevance to readers in the United States, the United Kingdom, and many other countries because those countries do not have a national \"Department of Home Affairs.\" This aspect verifies that the claim is specific to South Africa and may not apply to other countries.", "Multiple inquiries about the authenticity of the warning": "The expert's verdict mentions that they received multiple inquiries from readers in September 2019 regarding the viral social media warning. This aspect indicates that the claim gained significant attention and raised concerns among the public.", "Clarification from South Africa": "s Department of Home Affairs: The expert's verdict states that on September 2, 2019, South Africa's Department of Home Affairs published a statement clarifying that they were aware of the social media messages but had not received any reports of such a robbery scam at that time. This clarification from the relevant government department adds credibility to the claim's lack of authenticity."}
