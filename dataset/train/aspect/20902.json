{"Reverse image search": "The expert used the video verification tool InVID WeVerify to run a reverse image search on multiple frames of the video. This helped in locating the same video clip in YouTube videos from Vietnam's Ho Chi Minh city, indicating that the claim was not authentic.", "Comparison with a clearer video": "The expert conducted a search with the keywords \"motorcycle traffic in Vietnam\" on Google and found a similar video that was much clearer and filmed from the same elevated angle as the claimed video. This comparison provided further evidence that the claim was false.", "Petrol station identification": "Both the claimed video and the clearer video from Vietnam showed a petrol station in the top right with blue and yellow corporate colors. The expert searched for petrol stations in Vietnam and found that Petrolimex, Vietnam's liquefied petroleum gas state company, had the exact features. This identification added to the evidence against the authenticity of the claim.", "Junction analysis": "The expert analyzed the junction seen in the videos and compared it to different junctions in Kisii town using Google Maps street views. There was no resemblance between the junctions, indicating that the claimed video did not depict a busy traffic junction in Kisii town. The expert also found that the junction in the videos from Vietnam was controlled by traffic lights, whereas the claimed video appeared to show a disorderly scene due to manipulation of the video speed. This analysis further supported the conclusion that the claim was false."}
