{"Protesters demonstrating in front of Sherwin": "Williams headquarters with banners accusing the company of \"covering the world with LEAD PAINT\" is a visual and public display of the claim being made.", "The Change": "org petition by Occupational Knowledge International explicitly calls on Sherwin-Williams to stop making lead paint and poisoning people around the world, further reinforcing the claim.", "The fact that lead": "based paint has been banned in the United States since 1978 due to its toxicity, especially to children, supports the claim that making such paint could be harmful.", "The presence of 16 Sherwin": "Williams licensees who produce and sell the company's branded paint overseas, combined with the acknowledgment that these licensees control the content of their products, suggests the possibility of lead-containing paint being sold in countries where regulations are lacking."}
