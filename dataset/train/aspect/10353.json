{"Comparison to FBI homicide statistics": "The expert verified the authenticity of the claim by comparing it to FBI homicide statistics. They found that the claim about more murders being committed with hammers than shotguns, pistols, and AK-47s was accurate according to the FBI data.", "Verification through news stories": "The expert also checked news stories that reported the claim made by state Sen. Bill Jackson. They found that the initial news story had misquoted Jackson, using the word \"rifles\" instead of \"pistols.\" The expert confirmed this discrepancy by contacting the reporter who agreed that the quote was wrong.", "Examination of similar claims": "The expert reviewed similar claims made in the past by gun control critics. They found that Facebook posts and statements by other politicians, such as Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott, had also mentioned the higher number of murders with hammers compared to rifles. This examination helped support the authenticity of the claim.", "Comparison to FBI data on weapon types": "The expert referenced the FBI data on the types of weapons used to commit murders in 2011. They found that the numbers mentioned in the claim closely matched the FBI data, with only a slight difference in the number of murders committed with hands or feet. This comparison further validated the claim."}
