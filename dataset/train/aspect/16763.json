{"Lack of evidence of banning": "The expert's verdict states that there is no evidence to support the claim that the video was banned by Facebook. The video in question remains live on the platform, contradicting the assertion that it was banned or removed.", "Video origin and content": "The video in question features audio from President Trump's 2020 State of the Union address and showcases images and clips related to American history and achievements. It does not explicitly appear to be an official campaign ad from the Trump campaign.", "Presence on other platforms": "The video can also be found on Instagram and YouTube, where it is referred to as \"Trump's new ad\" on Facebook. This suggests that the video is not specifically banned or targeted on Facebook, as it is available on other platforms as well.", "Absence from Facebook Ad Library": "The expert's investigation did not find any evidence of the video being advertised by the Trump campaign in the Facebook Ad Library, which includes ads that have been taken down. This further supports the claim that the video was not officially promoted or banned by Facebook."}
