{"The source of the claim": "The expert's verdict states that the claim was based on a 1997 study conducted by the U.S. National Institute of Justice. This study looked at gun owners' responses to a 1994 national survey regarding how they acquired their weapons.", "Research methodology": "The study conducted by Philip Cook of Duke University and Jens Ludwig of the University of Chicago involved a survey of 251 gun owners. The participants were asked about the origin of their weapons, including whether they acquired them from federally licensed firearm dealers.", "Interpretation of the data": "The expert's verdict mentions that the co-authors of the study concluded that 60 percent of the guns were bought from federally licensed firearm dealers and were subject to background checks. However, they also estimated that between 30-40 percent of all gun transactions occurred through \"off-the-books\" transfers where background checks were not required.", "Criticisms and limitations of the research": "The expert's verdict highlights several criticisms and limitations of the study. These include the small sample size, with only 251 participants, and the fact that some participants were unsure about the source of their guns. Additionally, the survey was conducted eight months after the implementation of the Brady Act, which mandated background checks, potentially influencing the results. The expert's verdict also mentions that when asked to summarize the 1994 data, one of the researchers estimated that only 14 to 22 percent of the guns were purchased without background checks."}
