{"Testimony from Sara Stevenson": "a school librarian, who stated that she was the fifth person to submit a request to testify but was called to testify much later in the hearing. This provides evidence that witnesses were called randomly, regardless of when they submitted their requests.", "Confirmation that no school voucher plan had passed into Texas law despite previous attempts": "This information supports the claim that the Senate Education Committee was considering such legislation, making it relevant to verify the authenticity of the claim.", "Testimony from witnesses who attended the hearing and did not perceive any randomness in the order of witnesses called to testify": "This provides a contrasting perspective and suggests that the claim may not be entirely accurate.", "The statement from Patsy Spaw": "the Senate secretary, who explained that committee chairs have control over how hearings proceed and that witnesses had to submit paper registration cards. This information helps to understand the process of selecting witnesses and adds credibility to the claim."}
