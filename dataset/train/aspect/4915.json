{"Lack of evidence before the war": "The expert's verdict mentions that they searched newspaper articles and television transcripts from 2002 and 2003 and did not find any examples of Trump unequivocally denouncing the war until a year after it began. This lack of evidence suggests that Trump did not criticize the rush to war before it started.", "Trump": "s comments during the lead-up to the war: The expert highlights Trump's comments in January 2003, just a few months before the invasion, where he expressed skepticism about the mission in Iraq but did not explicitly criticize the rush to war. This suggests that Trump's opposition to the war was not evident at that time.", "Inconsistent statements after the war started": "The expert mentions that a week after the United States invaded Iraq, Trump gave differing takes on the situation. This inconsistency raises doubts about Trump's claim of being among the earliest to criticize the rush to war."}
