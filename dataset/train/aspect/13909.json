{"Economic analyses suggest modest job growth": "Most economic analyses of the Republican tax plans suggest that there will be modest job growth. Moody's Analytics forecasts the creation of 500,000 to 600,000 net new jobs over 10 years, while the Tax Foundation's analysis of the Senate plan predicts 925,000 additional full-time equivalent jobs over the same period.", "Lack of complete analysis from the Joint Committee on Taxation": "The government's nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation has not yet completed its analysis of the plans' effect on employment. This means that there is no official verdict from this authoritative source on the claim.", "Claims of job loss in manufacturing": "Jared Bernstein, formerly a member of President Obama's economic team, argues that the Republican plan is \"likely to lead to job loss (relative to a baseline) in manufacturing.\" He suggests that working-class factory workers would be negatively affected.", "Divergent claims from political leaders": "President Donald Trump claims that the tax changes \"will bring jobs\" and benefit those looking for employment, while House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi argues that the Republican tax plan will be a \"job-killer.\" These conflicting statements highlight the differing opinions on the impact of the tax plans on job creation."}
