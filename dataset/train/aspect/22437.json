{"The Clean Water Act regulates streams that flow into downstream waters": "including tributaries, ponds, streams, and wetlands.", "U": "S. Supreme Court rulings in 2001 and 2006 created uncertainty about the reach of the Clean Water Act, rolling back federal protections for about 60 percent of streams and millions of acres of wetlands.", "In May 2015": "the EPA announced a new rule to clarify which bodies of water fall under the act, focusing on whether a body of water can carry pollution into larger waters.", "The new rule does not consider the size of a body of water": "but rather its potential to flow into larger ecosystems during the rainy season. Isolated ponds that do not connect to major waters are not covered by the act."}
