{"The claim is supported by a report called": "The Truth About Guns and Suicide\" published by the Brady Center & Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, a nonprofit advocating gun control. The report states that studies examining firearm ownership and suicide rates at the national, state, and regional levels provide evidence of a connection between firearm ownership and higher suicide rates.", "The report cites studies conducted by the Harvard Injury Control Research Center in Massachusetts": "which compared data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on the number of suicides in each state and the percentage of households with firearms. These studies found that states with higher rates of household gun ownership also had higher rates of firearm suicides and overall suicides.", "The claim is supported by the statement of Mira Signer": "executive director of the Virginia chapter of the National Alliance on Mental Illness, who mentioned that the availability of guns poses special risks to those with mental disorders. She stated that states with the highest gun ownership rates also have the highest suicide rates, and she believes the evidence supports this claim.", "The claim is based on data from the CDC": "s Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, which used to ask participants whether they had guns in their homes. By analyzing this data, researchers were able to determine statistically reliable percentages of households with a gun in each state, and they found a correlation between higher rates of household gun ownership and higher rates of firearm suicides and overall suicides."}
