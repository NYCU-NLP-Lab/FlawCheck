{"Health care spending": "The expert's verdict provides evidence that the United States spends far more on health care compared to other countries. The claim is supported by data showing that in 2017, health care spending in the United States was about twice as much as 11 other large, wealthy countries.", "Comparison of GDP spending": "Another aspect highlighted is the comparison of health care spending as a percentage of the gross domestic product (GDP). The expert's verdict mentions that the United States spent 17.8% of its GDP on health care, while the average for other high-income countries was 11.5%. This indicates that the United States allocates a significantly higher portion of its economic output to health care.", "High health care prices": "The expert's verdict emphasizes that high health care prices, including drugs, salaries, administration costs, and medical services, contribute to the excessive spending in the United States. The study mentioned in the verdict suggests that Americans do not necessarily use more health care services, but the prices are significantly higher.", "Poor health care outcomes": "The expert's verdict provides evidence that the United States ranks poorly in health care outcomes compared to other high-income countries. The verdict mentions a report by the Commonwealth Fund, which ranked the United States last among 11 high-income countries in health care outcomes. The report highlights specific areas where the United States performs poorly, such as infant mortality, life expectancy at age 60, and preventable deaths."}
