{"The testimonies of the photographer and the senior director of Getty Images confirm the authenticity of the claim": "Both individuals confirm that the photos were taken at the Tornillo-Guadalupe port of entry gate in Texas, where Ocasio-Cortez was protesting the separation of children from their parents.", "The description of the location in the photos matches the layout of the Tornillo": "Guadalupe toll plaza, the road leading to the camp, and the chain fence near shrubs and a wall with a U.S. Customs and Border Protection sign. This provides further evidence that the photos were taken at the stated location.", "The context provided by Ocasio": "Cortez herself, where she states that the images were taken during a protest against the housing of migrant children in a tent city, supports the authenticity of the claim. Her statement aligns with the purpose of the protest and the images captured.", "The presence of critics and the spread of the claim on social media platforms": "including posts from RT (a Russian government-backed news organization) and PJ Media (a conservative news outlet), also suggest that the claim is authentic. The fact that these sources were attempting to discredit Ocasio-Cortez by claiming she was crying over an empty parking lot indicates that the images and the emotions portrayed in them were real."}
