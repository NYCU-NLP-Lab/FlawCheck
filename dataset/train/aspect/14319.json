{"Lack of specific details": "The expert mentions that none of the reproductions of the quote provide any specific information about the event in which Hillary Clinton allegedly made the statement. There is no mention of who she was speaking to, the setting of the event, or any other details that could verify the authenticity of the claim.", "Absence of records": "The expert states that there is no record of Hillary Clinton engaging in any public appearance or interview on the date mentioned in the claim (11 March 2014) where she could have made the statement. Additionally, there are no news accounts or transcripts that reference such a quote from that date or any other time.", "Delayed appearance on the internet": "The expert notes that the quoted words attributed to Hillary Clinton did not start appearing on the internet until months after they were supposedly spoken. This delay raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Contradictory evidence": "The expert mentions that Hillary Clinton did participate in an interview with ABC's Diane Sawyer on 9 June 2014, where she was questioned about her accomplishments as Secretary of State. However, the expert confirms that Clinton did not make a statement similar to the one quoted in the claim during that interview. This contradictory evidence further undermines the authenticity of the claim."}
