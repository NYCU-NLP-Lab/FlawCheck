{"The video and photograph were analyzed to determine their authenticity": "It was found that the video showed an ordinary hailstorm in Sinop, Turkey, while the photograph of black stones was unrelated to the hailstorm and had been circulating online since at least November 2015.", "Multiple sources": "including the Facebook page \"Severe Weather Europe\" and Meteo News, shared the video with captions labeling it as a hailstorm in Sinop, Turkey. This helped verify the location and timing of the event.", "Other video footage originating from the same hailstorm in Sinop": "Turkey, showed the hailstones landing on a street and provided an unobstructed view of their ordinary color. This additional footage helped confirm that the hailstones were not actually black but appeared so in the original video due to splashing into muddy water.", "The photograph of the black stones was found to be unrelated to the May 2016 hailstorm in Turkey": "It had been circulating since at least November 2015 and was taken during a different event where villagers in Turkey were selling meteorite fragments. The connection between the photograph and the claim of black stones raining from the sky in Sinop, Turkey was deemed invalid."}
