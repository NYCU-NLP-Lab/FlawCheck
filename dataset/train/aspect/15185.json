{"Lack of credible source": "The expert mentions that they were unable to find the source of the image in question. It does not appear in reputable galleries documenting Trump's visit to Walter Reed, which raises doubts about its authenticity.", "Inconsistency with other reports": "The New York Times reported that Trump had his mask below his nose at one point, but they did not include the viral photograph or any other image to illustrate this. This inconsistency adds to the skepticism surrounding the authenticity of the image.", "Image quality and oddities": "The expert notes that the viral photograph is of low quality, compressed, and blurry. Upon closer examination, they found apparent oddities such as Trump's nose appearing more angular than normal. These anomalies raise questions about the authenticity of the image.", "Violation of CDC guidelines": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) emphasizes that a face mask must be worn over the mouth and nose to be effective. If the image is genuine, it shows Trump incorrectly wearing his mask below his nose, which contradicts the recommended guidelines. This discrepancy further casts doubt on the authenticity of the claim."}
