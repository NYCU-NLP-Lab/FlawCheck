{"The claim is based on an article from a pro": "life website, LifeNews.com, which alleges that Kyrsten Sinema voted to allow abortions up to birth. This article is used as evidence to support the claim.", "The national pro": "life group Susan B. Anthony List (SBA List) and Center for Arizona Policy Action launched a ground campaign to expose Sinema's views on abortion ahead of the midterm election. They claim that Sinema has repeatedly voted to continue sending tax dollars to Planned Parenthood and voted against a measure to stop abortion after five months.", "The article does not provide specific evidence or voting records to support the claim that Sinema voted to allow abortions up to birth": "It only references a 2012 bill, H.B. 2036, which aimed to make it a misdemeanor crime to perform an abortion on a fetus after five months, except in cases of extenuating medical circumstances. This bill was ultimately ruled unconstitutional by the 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals.", "The claim is made in the context of a tight race between Sinema and her Republican opponent": "Martha McSally, with Sinema holding a narrow lead. The mention of a court challenge regarding post-election ballot verification suggests that the claim could be politically motivated and used as a tactic to sway voters."}
