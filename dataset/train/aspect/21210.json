{"The claim originated from an": "official msg from police\" circulating on social media, warning drivers about gangs throwing eggs at car windshields to stop them and rob them.", "The urban legend of gangs using eggs on windshields has been circulating on social media for at least ten years and has been shared in various English": "speaking countries, including the US, the UK, Australia, and South Africa.", "The origin of the urban legend is unclear": "but it is likely created outside of North America due to the use of the word \"windscreen\" instead of \"windshield.\"", "While there have been incidents of cars being egged in Canada": "there is no evidence to suggest that it is a common tactic used by gangs. Furthermore, there is no scientific study confirming that eggs on a windshield impair visibility up to 92.5 percent, and tests have been conducted showing that using wipers and water can easily remove the egg residue."}
