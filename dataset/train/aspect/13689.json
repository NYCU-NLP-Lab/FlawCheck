{"The first aspect employed to verify the authenticity of the claim is the comparison of the photos": "The expert's verdict mentions that the first photo shows a rubbish-filled body of water during the Aquino term, while the second photo shows the same body of water without noticeable pollutants during Duterte's term. This comparison helps establish the context and timeline of the photos.", "The second aspect is the publication date of the photos": "The expert's verdict states that a combined reverse image and keyword search on Google revealed that both photos were published online in May 2011, which is more than five years before Duterte took office. This information confirms that the photos were not taken during Duterte's presidency.", "The third aspect involves the sources of the photos": "The expert's verdict mentions that the photos were published in a report by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in May 2011. The ADB report specifically refers to cleanup operations in a Pasig River tributary. Additionally, the photos were also published in a September 2012 report by Philippine news organization Rappler. These sources provide additional evidence of the photos' authenticity and their connection to the Pasig River cleanup operations.", "The fourth aspect is the debunking of the claim by FactRakers": "a Philippines-based fact-checking initiative. The expert's verdict mentions that FactRakers has also debunked the misleading use of the photos. This external validation adds credibility to the expert's verdict and further confirms that the claim is not authentic."}
