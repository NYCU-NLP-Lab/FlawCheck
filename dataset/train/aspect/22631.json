{"The quotation attributed to Nepal Singh": "a BJP MP, was verified by checking multiple sources, including social media posts, tweets, and news articles. The official handle of Mumbai Congress also posted about this statement, further confirming its existence.", "The timing of the statement was investigated to determine if it was related to the recent Pulwama attack": "It was found that the statement was made in January 2018, not in response to the Pulwama attack in February 2019. This information was verified through news reports and the video of Nepal Singh uttering the controversial words.", "The credibility of the sources sharing the claim was examined": "It was discovered that the Facebook page We Hate Na Rendra Mo Di, which initially posted about the statement, has a history of spreading misinformation and posting anti-BJP content. This raised doubts about the accuracy and intention behind the claim.", "The overall context and background of the statement were taken into consideration": "While Nepal Singh's statement was criticized for its insensitivity, it was important to understand that it was made in response to a previous terror attack on a CRPF training camp in Pulwama in December 2017. This information helped in evaluating the claim's relevance to the recent Pulwama attack and exposed the mischievous and opportunistic nature of its portrayal."}
