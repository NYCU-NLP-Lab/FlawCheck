{"Lack of evidence": "The expert's verdict highlights that there is no evidence to support the claim that Obama wiretapped Trump Tower. This lack of evidence undermines the authenticity of the claim.", "Comparison to Watergate": "The expert points out that the claim draws a comparison between Obama's alleged wiretapping and the Watergate scandal that led to Nixon's downfall. However, the expert explains that the two situations are not comparable, as Nixon's impeachment was not solely based on the wiretapping but also on his attempts to cover it up and obstruct the investigation.", "Confirmation from Senate Intelligence Committee": "The expert mentions that both the Republican chairman and the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee issued a joint statement stating that they saw no indications that Trump Tower was under surveillance. This official confirmation contradicts the claim's assertion.", "Official statements and reports": "The expert cites various official sources, such as the Justice Department and the Inspector General, who have stated that there are no records or proof of wiretapping at Trump Tower. These official statements further undermine the authenticity of the claim."}
