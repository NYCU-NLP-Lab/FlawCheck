{"The use of sensational headlines and graphic descriptions in the reports": "such as \"Horrifying! Male OFW in Saudi, castrated first then raped by 9 Arabs\", aimed at grabbing attention and evoking strong emotions.", "The inclusion of a photograph of a Filipino worker": "Aljun Andrade, who was actually a victim of physical assault in Saudi Arabia and not a victim of castration and gang rape. This misleading use of the image added a false visual element to the claim.", "The exploitation of public interest in the mistreatment and abuse of overseas Filipino workers": "whose remittances contribute significantly to the country's GDP. The false reports capitalized on this sensitive topic to attract more clicks and generate revenue through advertisements.", "The presence of multiple reports that were widely shared on Facebook": "reaching an audience of millions of followers. These reports served as clickbait and were designed to lead users to click on advertisements, indicating a motive of financial gain rather than providing accurate information."}
