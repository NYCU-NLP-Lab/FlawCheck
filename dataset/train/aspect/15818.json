{"Testimony from poll training manager": "Angela Westmoreland, a poll training manager for Horry County, where Myrtle Beach is located, stated that the claim of poll workers marking ballots is not correct information. This testimony provides firsthand knowledge and expertise in the training and practices of poll workers.", "Confirmation from county officials": "Officials in Horry County, including Chris Whitmire, the director of public information for the South Carolina state election commission, refuted the claim and stated that there is no truth to it. Their expertise and position in the election commission lend credibility to their statements.", "Lack of motive for poll workers": "The expert's verdict mentions that poll workers have practically no reason to mark ballots, and even if they did, it would not invalidate a person's vote. This reasoning highlights the implausibility of the claim and supports the conclusion that it is unfounded.", "Absence of location": "specific evidence: While the initial claim mentioned Myrtle Beach, subsequent versions of the text circulated without a specific location attached. This lack of location-specific evidence weakens the credibility of the claim and suggests that it may be a baseless rumor or misinformation."}
