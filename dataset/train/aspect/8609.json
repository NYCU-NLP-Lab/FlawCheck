{"Verification of the claim": "s source: The expert checked with Stacey Johnson, McDonnell's press secretary, who stated that the number of 60,000 net new jobs came from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).", "Calculation method for determining net job gain": "The expert contacted Randy Marcus, Chief of Staff for Lt. Gov. Bill Bolling, who explained the computation method used by the administration.

The expert found that while the 60,000 figure was slightly inflated, it was still in the ballpark. The previous claim of 71,500 new jobs was also verified to be accurate.", "Comparison with other states": "The expert confirmed McDonnell's statement that only Texas had gained more jobs than Virginia since February, based on BLS statistics. Texas had added 128,800 jobs, while Virginia had experienced a net job gain of 60,000."}
