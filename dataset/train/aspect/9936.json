{"The article is based on a 2017 press release about the 125th Annual Convention of the American Psychological Association": "where Dr. Julianna Holt-Lunstad, a professor of psychology at Brigham Young University, presented a study on the connection between social isolation and mortality. This study analyzed 218 previous studies on the topic.", "The study found that lonely people were 50 percent more likely to die during the observation period compared to those with good social connections": "This statistic is compared to a 2016 Harvard study that found obese individuals have a 45 percent higher risk of death.", "The article mischaracterizes the study": "s findings by claiming that being single is more dangerous than obesity. However, the study did not specifically focus on romantic relationships, and the result was not specific to being single. The health risk identified in the study is associated with loneliness, not simply being single.", "The article": "s headline exaggerates the findings by stating that being single \"will kill you faster\" than obesity. The expert clarifies that being single itself is not the cause of mortality, but rather the loneliness associated with being single may carry the risk. The headline misrepresents the actual risk and the specific factor contributing to it."}
