{"Cherry": "picking numbers or ignoring Europe's larger population: The expert's verdict highlights that President Trump's claim of Europe's excess mortality being 33% higher than the United States is only possible when selectively choosing data or disregarding the fact that Europe has a larger population.", "Misleading statistics in press briefings": "The expert points out that President Trump repeatedly mentioned the misleading statistic of Europe's excess mortality being 33% to 40% higher than the United States in multiple press briefings. This repetition aimed to create a specific narrative about the U.S. handling of the pandemic compared to European nations.", "Lack of evidence and source for the statistic": "The expert mentions that despite requesting the White House for a source and more information on how the 40% higher excess mortality figure was calculated, no response was received. This lack of evidence raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Exaggerating U": "S. success and downplaying other countries' experiences: The expert highlights that President Trump's recurring use of this statistic is part of a larger effort to portray the U.S.'s response to the coronavirus as superior to that of European countries. However, previous comparisons made by Trump have been proven false, suggesting a pattern of exaggeration and downplaying the experiences of other nations."}
