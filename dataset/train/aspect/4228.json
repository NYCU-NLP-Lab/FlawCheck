{"Lack of evidence": "The expert's verdict highlights that there is no evidence to support the claim that perpetrators of school shootings have been drugged with Ritalin. This lack of evidence suggests that the claim is not authentic.", "Research findings": "The expert's verdict cites the research conducted by Katherine S. Newman and Peter Langman, both of whom have extensively studied school shootings. Both researchers have found no ties between psychiatric medication, specifically Ritalin, and school shootings. Their research findings contradict the claim, further questioning its authenticity.", "Overprescription debate": "The expert's verdict mentions the ongoing debate about the overprescription of ADHD medication. While this debate is not directly related to the claim, it provides context and highlights the potential concerns surrounding the use of medication in treating ADHD. However, it does not provide evidence to support the claim.", "Cultural influence": "The expert's verdict acknowledges the influence of violence in media, such as movies and television shows, on young people. This aspect suggests that the claim may be attempting to attribute school shootings to a broader cultural issue rather than medication. However, it does not provide any evidence to support the claim's authenticity."}
