{"The claim falsely asserts that Hillary Clinton ignored multiple requests for security and didn": "t respond for 13 hours during the Benghazi attack, leading to the deaths of four Americans. However, there is no evidence that Clinton was aware of these requests or that she was inattentive throughout the attacks.", "The claim inaccurately suggests that Trump rushed in reinforcements and ensured no lives were lost during the Baghdad embassy attack": "While it is true that Trump deployed more troops to the Middle East after the attack, it was not solely his responsibility to send troops to the scene, and the military chain of command took that responsibility.", "The claim falsely compares the Benghazi attacks": "which resulted in the deaths of the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans, to the storming of the U.S. embassy in Baghdad. The Benghazi attacks were much more violent and had a higher casualty count.", "The claim incorrectly implies that Clinton": "s response to the Benghazi attacks was inadequate, while praising Trump's response to the Baghdad embassy attack. However, multiple investigations have concluded that no action by Clinton or anyone in the administration could have moved additional forces to Benghazi before the last American deaths occurred."}
