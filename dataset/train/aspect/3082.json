{"The president": "s claim that \"Farmers have been on a downward trend for 15 years\" is contradicted by the fact that U.S. farms experienced a golden period during 2011 through 2014, with strong commodity prices and robust agricultural exports.", "Net farm income in real inflation": "adjusted dollars reached a record $133.6 billion in 2013, according to USDA data. This contradicts the claim that farmers have done poorly for 15 years.", "The decline in net farm income in the last five years is not indicative of a continuous downward trend for 15 years": "but rather a fluctuation influenced by factors such as commodity prices and weather conditions, as stated in a report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service.", "The claim that trade barriers and tariffs imposed by other countries have been destroying farmers": "businesses is not supported by evidence. While tariffs and trade barriers can have an impact on agricultural exports, it is an oversimplification to attribute the challenges faced by farmers solely to these factors."}
