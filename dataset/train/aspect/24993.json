Census Bureau estimates that close to 1 million fewer people were in poverty in 2017 compared with 2016, which contradicts the claim that 1 million Americans were lifted out of poverty in a single year.", "The drop in the number of people in poverty was larger in 2016 and 2015": "with estimated declines of 2.5 million and 3.5 million people respectively. The largest estimated decline was in 1966, with nearly 4.7 million people lifted out of poverty.", "The official poverty rate in 2017 was 12": "3 percent, which was lower than the 2016 rate of 12.7 percent. However, the 2016 rate was also lower than the 2015 rate, indicating that the decline in poverty was not a record-breaking achievement.", "The Census Bureau stated that the 2017 estimate of people in poverty was not statistically different from the 2016 estimate": "suggesting that the difference between the two estimates is likely due to chance rather than a significant improvement in poverty rates."}
