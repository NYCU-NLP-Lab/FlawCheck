{"Minister Jeff Radebe": "s claim about Africa's population growth was made during South Africa's annual presidency budget vote.", "Radebe": "s claim stated that \"by 2050, it is projected that Africa will have the same population as China and India combined.\"", "However": "it was discovered that Radebe went off script and was actually meant to say \"by 2050, it is projected that Africa will have the same population as China and India combined today.\"", "The claim made by Radebe was fact": "checked using data from the 2015 edition of the United Nations World Population Prospect Report, which estimated Africa's population to be 1.2 billion in 2015 and predicted it to double by 2050 to reach 2.5 billion. In comparison, the combined population of China and India in 2015 was 2.7 billion, and by 2050, it is projected to be 3.1 billion. Therefore, the claim that Africa will have the same population as China and India combined is incorrect."}
