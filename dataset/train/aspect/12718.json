{"Discrepancy in descriptions": "The expert noted that the descriptions provided in the claim and accompanying texts did not match the actual photograph of Hercules and his owner. This raised doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Inconsistent information about Hercules": "The expert mentioned that while there was a real English Mastiff named Hercules recognized as the world's heaviest dog, there was no evidence linking him to the dog shown in the photograph. This inconsistency cast doubt on the claim's authenticity.", "Uncertainty about the previous heaviest dog": "The expert highlighted the uncertainty surrounding a previous contender for the title of the world's heaviest dog, a dog named Kell. Conflicting reports about Kell's status and weight at the time the \"Hercules\" photograph circulated added to the difficulty of verifying the claim.", "Discrepancy in breed and size": "The expert observed that the dog in the photograph appeared to be a Neapolitan Mastiff, rather than an English Mastiff like Hercules. The significant difference in size between the typical height of a Neapolitan Mastiff and the dog in the photo raised suspicions about the authenticity of the claim."}
