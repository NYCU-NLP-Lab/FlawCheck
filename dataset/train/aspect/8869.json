{"Lack of historical record": "The expert notes that there appears to be no record of anyone attributing the quote to JFK until around 2012, despite countless historians and academics studying Kennedy's words. This lack of historical evidence raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Inconsistency with JFK": "s known statements: The expert highlights that the quote's content, which includes references to Israel's nuclear program, the Federal Reserve, secret societies, occultists, and Zionists, seems unlikely to have been uttered by JFK. A search of JFK's public papers and digital archives reveals no evidence supporting the quote.", "Unlikely predictive nature": "The expert argues that the quote's prophetic nature is unlikely, considering JFK's sudden and unexpected assassination. The claim suggests that JFK predicted events that would occur \"one day\" after he was \"long gone,\" which contradicts the circumstances of his death and the context of his presidency.", "Verification from the JFK Presidential Library": "The expert contacted the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum for verification. An archivist from the library pointed out several factors that further discredit the claim, including the lack of evidence in JFK's public papers and the inconsistency with his known statements. This verification from a reputable source adds credibility to the conclusion that the claim is false."}
