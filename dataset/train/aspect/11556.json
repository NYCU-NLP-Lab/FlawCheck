{"The claim is based on an article published by Astronomy": "Physics.com, which reported that the 2017 Perseid meteor shower will be the brightest in human history. This source is mentioned in the expert's verdict.", "The claim states that the meteor shower will be the brightest in recorded human history": "but the expert's verdict provides evidence that this claim is unsupported. The expert refers to NASA's \"2017 Meteor Shower Activity Forecast for Earth Orbit,\" which states that the Perseid meteor shower in 2017 is expected to have lower activity levels compared to the previous year.", "The expert also mentions that the 1993 Perseid meteor shower holds the record for the largest Perseid shower ever recorded": "with rates topping 300 meteors per hour. This information contradicts the claim that the 2017 Perseid meteor shower will be the brightest in history.", "The expert highlights that the Perseids are not known for producing highly spectacular meteor showers compared to other meteor showers like the Leonids and the Draconids": "The Leonid meteor shower, for example, has had rates of up to 100,000 meteors per hour, which is significantly higher than the expected rates for the 2017 Perseids."}
