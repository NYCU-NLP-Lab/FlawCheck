{"Lack of evidence": "The expert's verdict highlights that there is no evidence to support the claim that Margaret Keenan, the first recipient of a COVID-19 vaccine in the U.K., is a \"crisis actor\" named Liz Scott. This lack of evidence undermines the authenticity of the claim.", "Baseless conspiracy theory": "The expert's verdict describes the claim as a baseless conspiracy theory. It emphasizes that social media posts are peddling this theory without any factual basis. This aspect further discredits the claim's authenticity.", "Differences in photos": "The expert's verdict points out that the posts on Facebook and Twitter present photos of different women, claiming them to be the same person. However, there are noticeable differences between the women in the photos, indicating that they are not the same individual. This discrepancy raises doubts about the claim's authenticity.", "Verification through news outlets": "Multiple news outlets have identified Margaret Keenan as the recipient of the COVID-19 vaccine, describing her as a grandmother nearing 91 and a former jewelry shop assistant. The National Health Service in England has also provided information about her background. These verifications from reputable sources add credibility to Keenan's identity and counter the claim that she is a crisis actor."}
