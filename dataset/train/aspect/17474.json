{"The expert points out that the comparison between flu deaths and COVID": "19 deaths is not valid because they did not enter the US at the same time. The first case of COVID-19 was reported on Jan. 20, while the flu was being tracked since 2019.", "The expert highlights that the claim made by North Carolina Lt": "Gov. Dan Forest overlooks data from his own state, which shows that there have been more COVID-19 deaths than flu deaths.", "The expert mentions that the number of actual flu deaths could be much lower than the CDC": "s estimate, as indicated by a Harvard Medical School instructor. The number of actual flu deaths has been less than 10,000 in each of the past two seasons.", "The expert provides data from the CDC": "which shows that in previous seasons, the number of flu deaths ranged from 23,000 to 61,000. This suggests that the claim of more flu deaths than COVID-19 deaths is not accurate, as COVID-19 deaths have already surpassed 50,000 according to the CDC's data."}
