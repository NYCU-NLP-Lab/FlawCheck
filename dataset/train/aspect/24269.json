{"The source of the claim": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim was made by Leticia Lee, chairwoman of a pro-Beijing group called the Justice Alliance, in a Facebook post on September 17, 2019. This establishes the origin of the claim.", "Contextual evidence": "The expert's verdict provides contextual evidence by mentioning that the photos were taken in June 2019, before the mass pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. This contradicts the claim that the students were dressed as pro-democracy protesters, indicating that the claim is misleading.", "Visual evidence": "The expert's verdict highlights the presence of advertising boards with the logo of NERF, a toy gun made by Hasbro, in the background of one of the photos. This visual evidence supports the school's statement that the photos were taken during a school activity and not related to pro-democracy protests.", "Comments and reactions": "The expert's verdict includes screenshots of comments made by Facebook users, expressing concern and even suggesting extreme punishments for the alleged actions in the photos. These comments indicate that some individuals believed the claim, further emphasizing the need to verify its authenticity."}
