{"The claim was made by MARTA General Manager Keith Parker": "who stated that \"18 percent of jobs are accessible by transit for metro Atlanta residents, 33 percent for those living in the city.\" This provides the initial source of the claim.", "The claim was supported by a presentation given by author Rebecca Burns at the Building Opportunity event": "where she cited The Brookings Institution for the statistics on a slide. This adds credibility to the claim as it is backed by a reputable research institution.", "The claim was verified by reaching out to Brookings": "Metropolitan Policy Program, the unit responsible for conducting research on cities and their surrounding areas. This demonstrates the effort made to ensure the accuracy of the claim by consulting experts in the field.", "The claim was further supported by a 2011 report from Brookings titled": "Missed Opportunity: Transit and Jobs in Metropolitan America,\" which found that the Atlanta-Sandy Springs-Marietta metro area had low accessibility to jobs via transit compared to other cities. This provides concrete evidence and data to substantiate the claim."}
