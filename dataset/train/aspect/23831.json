{"Video evidence": "The claim was supported by a video circulating on social media showing TMC candidate Saayoni Ghosh running during election campaigning in Burnpur. The video was widely shared and became the basis for the claim.", "Social media posts": "The claim was further propagated through social media posts by accounts such as OpIndia.com and @BefittingFacts, which shared the video and made allegations of harassment against TMC party workers. These posts added to the authenticity of the claim in the eyes of some viewers.", "Personal statement": "Saayoni Ghosh herself uploaded the video of her election campaigning in Burnpur and stated that her movement was not controlled by people sitting in Delhi. She denied the claim of harassment and accused the BJP of engaging in fake and frivolous comments. Her personal statement provided a counter-narrative to the claim.", "Media coverage": "Several media broadcasts covered Saayoni Ghosh's \"running for election\" campaign in Asansol. While OpIndia referred to ETV Bharat's report to support the claim of harassment, the report itself did not make such a claim. This discrepancy in media coverage and interpretation added complexity to verifying the authenticity of the claim."}
