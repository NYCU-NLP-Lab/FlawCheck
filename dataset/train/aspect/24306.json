{"The expert": "s statement is based on extensive studies that have been conducted on this issue. These studies have specifically focused on the thirty-two states that have some form of voter ID laws and have not shown any evidence of decreased total turnout.", "However": "the expert acknowledges that total turnout is not the main point of contention with voter ID laws. The debate revolves around whether these laws disproportionately disadvantage certain types of voters compared to others.", "The expert highlights a study conducted by the U": "S. Government Accountability Office (GAO), which found that changes in voter ID requirements in Kansas and Tennessee led to decreases in turnout. Additionally, out of the 10 studies reviewed by the GAO, five found no statistically significant effect on turnout, four found decreases, and one found an increase. This suggests that strict ID requirements may depress turnout."}
