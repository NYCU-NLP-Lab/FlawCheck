{"The photograph is a composite image created by merging a picture of a museum exhibit with an Associated Press photograph of Barack Obama eating a hot dog at an Independence Day picnic in Butte": "Montana, on July 4, 2008.", "The flattening of visual depth in the composite image creates an optical illusion": "making it appear as if Obama is eating a hot dog in front of a museum statue.", "Barack Obama is known for being aware of his surroundings while eating": "making it unlikely that he would eat a hot dog in such a manner in a museum.", "The source of the claim": "D'Abruzzo, Diana, is a writer for Politico and not an authoritative source on the authenticity of the photograph."}
