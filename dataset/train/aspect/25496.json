{"The claim is based on a single study published in 2002": "which observed a reduction in women's brain volume during pregnancy.", "The sample size of the study was small": "consisting of only 14 women, and it was originally designed to test differences in brain volume between healthy women and women with preeclampsia.", "There have been no efforts to replicate the results of the 2002 study": "as a 2016 review paper did not mention any subsequent studies attempting to replicate or validate the findings.", "The relevance of the study to a broader population of pregnant women is unclear": "as it focused on women with a specific condition (preeclampsia) and may not be representative of the general population."}
