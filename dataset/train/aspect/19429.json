{"The claim is based on an article by gossip columnist Jose Lambiet from the Palm Beach Post": "which mentioned that Lois Frankel took a helicopter ride to a dinner party. This article serves as the primary source of the claim.", "The claim is also supported by an advertisement by the YG Action Fund": "a conservative PAC, which depicted Frankel's headshot inside a cartoon image of a helicopter flying near a mansion with balloons falling from the sky. This visual representation reinforces the claim made by Adam Hasner.", "The fact": "checkers did not provide a definitive verdict on the authenticity of the claim, but they mentioned that they had previously fact-checked other claims made by the PAC regarding Frankel's pay raise and spending on a marble shower. These previous fact-checks indicate a pattern of scrutiny towards the claims made against Frankel's actions."}
