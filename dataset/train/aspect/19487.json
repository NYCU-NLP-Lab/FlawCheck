{"Conflation of calculations": "The expert points out that Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick is conflating two calculations in his statement - the death rate for the coronavirus and the number of coronavirus deaths per capita in Texas. The death rate is calculated by dividing the number of fatalities by the number of confirmed cases, while the number of deaths per capita considers the total population of Texas.", "Importance of death rate over deaths per capita": "The expert explains that the death rate is a more accurate measure of the danger posed by the virus, as it is a function of the number of people infected. On the other hand, deaths per capita can be influenced by factors such as the number of tests administered and the identification of milder cases.", "Consideration of testing and sample size": "The expert highlights the importance of considering the number of tests administered by each state. As more tests are conducted and more cases are identified, the death rate for the virus can change. The expert also mentions that the death rate calculation depends on sampling and the tests deployed, which can introduce uncertainty.", "Use of specific data and timeframe": "The expert mentions that the fact-check relies on data from March 31, the day Patrick made his statement. This is important because the number of cases and fatalities is constantly changing, and using specific data helps provide a clearer picture of the situation at that time."}
