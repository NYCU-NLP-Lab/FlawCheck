{"The ad claims that Mary Landrieu voted to take away gun rights": "specifically referring to her support of the Toomey-Manchin proposal, which aimed to expand federal background checks for firearm purchases made at gun shows and over the internet.", "The Fact Checker found that the Toomey": "Manchin proposal did not ban the sale of any firearms and concluded that it would not have prevented a woman from being able to defend herself against an intruder.", "The NRA later provided different evidence to support its claim": "stating that Landrieu's vote to confirm Justice Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court in 2009, a pick opposed by the NRA, was an indication of her anti-gun and anti-self defense stance.", "During Sotomayor": "s nomination proceedings, her past ruling on a Second Amendment issue became a talking point, specifically her involvement in a majority opinion that upheld New York's ban on chuka sticks (nunchucks). This ruling was criticized by Republicans as being against Second Amendment rights."}
