{"The claim that koalas are": "functionally extinct\" originated from a statement released by the Australian Koala Foundation (AKF) in May 2019, calling for the enactment of the Koala Protection Act.", "The AKF": "s statement suggested that there are no more than 80,000 koalas in Australia, leading to the belief that they may be functionally extinct.", "The expert": "Noah Greenwald from the Center for Biological Diversity, explained that there are two definitions of \"functionally extinct,\" neither of which applies to the koala. One definition refers to a species that still occurs in the wild but cannot effectively reproduce, while the other refers to a species that is so reduced that it can no longer play its role in the ecosystem.", "The International Union for Conservation": "IUCN) estimates that there are approximately 300,000 mature adult koalas remaining in the wild and categorizes the species as vulnerable, not functionally extinct. However, it is acknowledged that the koala population has been declining due to various factors such as food degradation, deforestation, hunting, drought, and fires."}
