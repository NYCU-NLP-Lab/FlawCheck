{"Comparison to other advanced countries": "The expert compared the number of school days in the United States to other advanced countries, specifically focusing on primary grades. They used statistics from the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) to determine that the average for primary grades in OECD countries was 187 days, while the average for countries in the European Union was 184 days per year. This comparison verified that American kids go to school fewer days than most other advanced countries.", "Calculation of": "about a month\" less: The expert calculated the number of days that would constitute \"about a month\" less of school, taking into account weekends. They determined that a generous figure for \"about a month\" would be at least 15 days. By comparing this figure to the number of countries with 195 or more days of school per year (which was eight out of 31), the expert concluded that it is not accurate to say that American kids go to school \"about a month\" less than most other advanced countries.", "Comparison to South Korea": "The expert also compared the number of school days in the United States to South Korea. They cited that American children spend over a month less in school than children in South Korea, who have 220 days of school per year. This comparison verified that American kids have significantly fewer school days compared to South Korea.", "Academic debate on longer school years": "The expert mentioned that the issue of longer school years has been debated in academic circles for years. While not directly verifying the claim, this aspect highlights the ongoing discussion and differing opinions on the topic. It suggests that the claim is a matter of opinion and subject to debate among experts."}
