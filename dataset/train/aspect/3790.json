{"The bill does not classify children conceived through artificial insemination as": "illegitimate\" but seeks to repeal a civil code that defines parental rights for both parents of such a child, regardless of biologic relation.", "The motivation behind the bill and its legal ramifications are disputed": "with the sponsor arguing that existing laws maintain parental rights, while critics allege a misreading of legal briefs or a desire to limit same-sex couples' ability to raise a child with equal legal protections.", "The bill aims to repeal TCA Section 68": "3-306, which deems a child born to a married woman as a result of artificial insemination, with consent of the husband, to be the legitimate child of the husband and wife.", "There is another statute": "TCA 36-2-304, that remains on the books and clarifies that when a child is born to a married woman, the child is presumed to be that of her husband, ensuring the legitimacy of a child conceived through insemination."}
