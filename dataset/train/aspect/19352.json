{"The claim is based on the assertion that current school lunch requirements cause large amounts of food waste and diminished use of school lunches": "2. The claim is supported by the introduction of the Local Control of School Lunch Act (HR 6541) by Fourth District U.S. Rep. Vicky Hartzler, which aims to curb nutritional regulations that require schools to serve more healthy foods.", "The claim is further supported by the argument that the Healthy": "Hunger-Free Kids Acts of 2010, which mandates schools to serve more fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and limits calorie and sodium intake, has led to increased food waste as kids find the new menu options unappetizing.", "The claim is backed by a 2014 study commissioned by the Department of Agriculture": "which shows an increase of more than 60 percent in the waste of both raw and cooked vegetables in school cafeterias. However, it is noted that the waste estimates in the study were based on observations and not actual measurements or calculations."}
