{"Testimony from Jon O": "Brien: The expert's verdict mentions that Jon O'Brien, the president of Catholics for Choice, presented written testimony to the Rhode Island House Judiciary Committee. O'Brien cited the statistic that only 14 percent of Catholics agree with the Vatican's position on abortion. This testimony is one aspect used to verify the claim.", "Source": "The expert's verdict states that Catholics for Choice directed them to their 2009 survey conducted by Belden Russonello & Stewart. This survey involved 923 Catholics who were registered voters and provided data on their views regarding the legality of abortion. The survey results, which showed only 14 percent supporting the Vatican's position, serve as another aspect to verify the claim.", "Margin of error": "The expert's verdict mentions that the margin of error for the 2009 survey conducted by Catholics for Choice was plus or minus 3.2 percentage points. This information is important to consider when interpreting the survey results and adds another aspect to the verification process.", "Comparison with other polls": "The expert's verdict also mentions a 2004 Quinnipiac University poll and a 2009 Quinnipiac poll that asked similar questions about abortion views among Catholics. While the exact numbers from these polls are not provided, the mention of these additional polls adds another aspect to the verification process by comparing the findings across multiple surveys."}
