{"The statement made by Heidi Heilman": "director of New England field development for Smart Approaches to Marijuana and president of the Massachusetts Prevention Alliance, that \"Today\u2019s marijuana is 300 percent to 800 percent more potent than the pot of yesteryear\" was the claim being examined for authenticity.", "The first aspect employed to verify the authenticity of the claim was a graph showing the increase in potency of marijuana from 1960 to 2011": "The graph indicated that the ratio of THC in marijuana went from 0.2 percent to 11.4 percent, resulting in an increase of 5,700 percent. However, this increase was well outside the range cited by Heilman.", "Another aspect involved a study published in the Journal of Forensic Science": "which examined 46,000 samples of marijuana seized during law enforcement raids. The study found that the THC concentrations of marijuana had risen by about 171 percent over a 16-year period ending in 2008. This increase was significantly lower than the 300 to 800 percent increase mentioned by Heilman.", "Additionally": "the expert's verdict mentioned that increases of 300 and 800 percent represent four- and nine-fold increases respectively. This clarification was made to ensure accurate interpretation of the claim, but it did not affect the ruling on the claim's authenticity."}
