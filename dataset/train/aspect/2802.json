{"The number of people dropping out of Obamacare": "The expert analyzes the claim that \"two million more people just dropped out of Obamacare\" and investigates the accuracy of this number. They explain that it has become routine for people to leave the health insurance exchanges in the first months of the year, often because they found insurance through an employer. The expert provides data from previous years to compare the drop in enrollment and highlights that the 2 million figure is not as convincing as Trump made it sound.", "Data source": "The expert mentions that the 2 million figure comes from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' snapshot of people who signed up for insurance on an exchange by the January 31, 2017, deadline but have not paid the premium to keep the policy active. They also compare this data collection method to previous years when the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services examined who had paid their premiums through the end of March.", "Change in data collection timeline": "The expert discusses the change in the reporting timeline by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. In 2017, the agency looked at who made payments through the end of February, which is a full month shorter than the previous year. This change in timeline is out of step with the March 1 start date for many policies. The expert questions the reasoning behind this change and notes that all the data for March was available at the time of the report's release.", "Alternative data source": "The expert mentions the website ACASignups, which tracks enrollment numbers across the country. They refer to data reported by Charles Gaba, a data activist, who stated that as of mid-January, 11.7 million people had signed up for Obamacare. This alternative data source provides additional context and perspective on the claim."}
