{"The claim states that Joe Biden": "s capital gains tax would result in individuals owing taxes of 40% of their profit when selling their home. The expert's verdict clarifies that Biden has proposed doubling the long-term capital gains rate from 20% to 39.6%, but this higher tax rate would only apply to individuals making more than $1 million per year. Therefore, the claim's assertion of a 40% tax on all home sale profits is not accurate.", "The expert": "s verdict includes information from the Internal Revenue Service, stating that the capital gains tax rate is no higher than 15% for most individuals. This contradicts the claim's statement of a 40% tax rate, reinforcing the inaccuracy of the claim."}
