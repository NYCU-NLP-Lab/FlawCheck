{"Inaccurate information in the accompanying text": "The expert's verdict highlights that the information provided in the meme, claiming that the statue was knocked over by vandals near the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, is inaccurate. The meme's text was taken from a different Facebook post from 2017, not 2018.", "Location discrepancy": "The expert points out that the photograph was not taken at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at the Veterans Plaza in Longview, Texas, as claimed in the meme. The actual Tomb of the Unknown Soldier is located at the Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia. The Veterans Plaza in Longview, Texas, has different monuments that do not include the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.", "Unverified claim of vandalism": "The expert mentions that there is no concrete evidence or reports supporting the claim that the statue was intentionally knocked over by vandals. While local police were investigating the incident as an act of vandalism, no arrests were made, and there is no photographic or video evidence of the alleged vandals causing the statue's destruction.", "Possibility of accidental or structural weakness": "The expert suggests that while the statue may have been vandalized, there is also a possibility that its toppling was accidental or a result of structural weakness. This highlights the need for further investigation and consideration of alternative explanations for the statue's condition."}
