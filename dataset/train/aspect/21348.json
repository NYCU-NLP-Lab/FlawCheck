{"Lack of readily available national data on police marksmanship": "The expert mentions that national numbers on police marksmanship are not readily available, making it difficult to verify the claim about trained police hitting their targets less than 30 percent of the time.", "Data from individual jurisdictions": "The expert found data on some individual jurisdictions, including several major metropolitan police departments, which can provide insights into police marksmanship. This data can be used to assess the accuracy of the claim.", "2008 Rand study on NYPD officer": "involved shootings: The expert refers to a 2008 Rand study that looked at the accuracy of New York Police Department (NYPD) officer-involved shootings. This study provides key data points, including the hit rate, which is the number of rounds that struck a suspect divided by total shots fired.", "Mixed findings from the Rand study": "The Rand study found that hit ratios were below 30 percent for gunfights and long-range shootings, but above 30 percent when suspects did not return fire or when the target was seven yards away or closer. These mixed findings indicate that the accuracy of trained police officers can vary depending on the circumstances."}
