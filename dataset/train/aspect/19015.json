{"The claim originated from right": "wing websites and personalities, such as Gateway Pundit and Big League Politics, which have a history of spreading conspiracy theories and misinformation.", "The claim falsely conflated two separate organizations": "Drag Queen Story Hour (DQSH) and the Drag Queen Story Hour Foundation, leading to misleading headlines and social media claims.", "Republican U": "S. Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado also falsely claimed that the \"drag queen story hour leader\" had been arrested, further spreading the misinformation.", "The arrest mentioned in the claim actually involved Brett Blomme": "a Milwaukee County circuit court judge, who was charged with possession of child pornography. Blomme's arrest was unrelated to his involvement with DQSH, and he held various positions of public trust prior to becoming a judge."}
