{"The claim is based on a web video released by the Florida Democratic Party": "which links a corruption study with Governor Rick Scott.", "The video highlights a clip of Governor Scott saying": "Florida won't stop until we're No. 1,\" implying a connection to government corruption.", "The video includes a newspaper headline typed over Governor Scott": "stating \"Study ranks Florida No. 1 in government corruption,\" reinforcing the claim.", "The study cited in the video was conducted by Integrity Florida": "a nonprofit watchdog group, and found that from 2000 to 2010, Florida led all states in total convictions of officials and staff who broke federal public corruption laws. However, the study included a disclaimer stating that the data was from a time period prior to Governor Scott taking office, indicating that the correlation between the corruption cases and Scott may be misconstrued."}
