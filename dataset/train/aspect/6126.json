{"Fisker Automotive received": "528 million in loan guarantees from the U.S. government to build electric hybrids, including the Karma and the Atlantic. The goal was to build the Atlantic at a plant in Delaware, but the project is currently on hold and the plant has not yet opened.", "The engineering and design for the Karma was done in the United States": "but the plan from the beginning was to build the cars in Finland. Fisker Automotive confirmed that about 500 Finnish workers were employed in the production of the Karmas.", "The claim that American stimulus dollars were used to pay for jobs in Finland is flawed": "The money received by Fisker Automotive was in the form of loan guarantees, not direct stimulus dollars. The loan guarantees were intended to support the development of innovative electric vehicles and create jobs in the United States.", "The assertion that the Obama administration sent stimulus money to buy electric cars from Finland as a payback to Obama supporters is misleading": "The decision to build the cars in Finland was made by Fisker Automotive, not the government. The loan guarantees were provided based on the company's business plan and the potential for job creation in the United States."}
