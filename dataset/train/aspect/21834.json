{"The claim states that": "Nick Rahall voted with Obama 94 percent of the time.\" This is the specific statement that is being fact-checked for its authenticity.", "The ad features a constituent": "Carrie Overby, who claims that Rahall has voted with Obama on various issues including spending, cap-and-trade, EPA regulations, and Obamacare. This provides specific examples of the policies on which Rahall is alleged to have aligned with Obama.", "The ad footnotes the claim to": "Congressional Quarterly 2009 vote analysis.\" This indicates that the source of the information is a study conducted by Congressional Quarterly in 2009.", "The fact": "checker investigates the data from the same CQ study and finds that Rahall's voting record with Obama was actually 88 percent in 2010, 65 percent in 2011, 64 percent in 2012, and 58 percent in 2013. This reveals that the claim of Rahall voting with Obama 94 percent of the time is inaccurate and misleading."}
