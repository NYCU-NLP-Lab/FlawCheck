{"Lack of evidence": "The expert's verdict states that evidence for the claim that undocumented immigrants have killed 63,000 U.S. citizens since 9/11 is lacking. This suggests that there is no substantial data or proof to support this claim.", "Mathematical impossibility": "The expert's analysis points out that the claim is mathematically impossible. The number of homicides in the United States from 2002 to 2016 was provided, and it is stated that it would be impossible for undocumented immigrants, who make up only 3% of the population, to have committed nearly a quarter of all homicides during that time period.", "Origin of the claim": "The expert mentions that the erroneous figure of 63,000 killings by undocumented immigrants appears to have originated in a post by Republican Rep. Steve King of Iowa. This suggests that the claim may have been politically motivated and not based on factual information.", "Lack of support from data": "The expert's analysis highlights that the numbers do not support the claim made by President Donald Trump. The data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows a different picture, contradicting the claim that undocumented immigrants have committed a disproportionately large number of homicides in the United States."}
