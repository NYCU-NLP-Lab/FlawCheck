{"Attendance records": "The expert's verdict mentions that the Scott campaign published a spreadsheet showing that Senator Nelson missed 45 percent of Senate Armed Services Committee hearings between 2001 and 2018. This data was obtained from the Senate Armed Services Committee website and the Government Printing Office.", "Variability in attendance": "The expert's verdict also states that Senator Nelson's attendance varied with each two-year congressional session, ranging from 44 percent in 2005-06 to 76 percent for the current 2017-18 session. This highlights that attendance rates can fluctuate over time and should be considered in context.", "Closed or classified hearings": "The expert's verdict points out that attendance records are not published for closed or classified hearings. This means that public attendance records do not provide a complete picture of Senator Nelson's service on the committee, as some important meetings may not be included in the attendance data.", "Alternative attendance figures": "The expert's verdict mentions that Senator Nelson's spokesman provided a different count of attendance, stating that Nelson attended 104 out of 126 Armed Services hearings, informal meetings, sessions, and briefings in 2017-18. However, PolitiFact could not verify these figures since they include meetings without a public attendance record. This highlights the challenge of obtaining comprehensive attendance data and the potential for differing interpretations of attendance figures."}
