{"Obama campaign adviser David Axelrod made the claim during NBC": "s Super Tuesday coverage that President Barack Obama received more votes in Ohio than Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum combined.", "The Ohio Secretary of State": "s election results page was examined to verify the claim, which showed that Obama received 547,588 votes in the Democratic primary, while Romney received 456,205 votes and Santorum received 445,697 votes in the Republican primary. The total of Romney and Santorum's votes was 901,902, which was higher than Obama's individual vote count.", "It was determined that Axelrod": "s claim was incorrect as Obama did not outpoll the combination of Romney and Santorum. However, Axelrod would have been correct if he had stated that Obama won more votes than either Romney or Santorum individually.", "The source of Axelrod": "s claim may have been a tweet by BuzzFeed editor Ben Smith, who initially stated that there were more votes for Obama in Ohio than for all Republicans combined. However, Smith later clarified that the early pile of votes for Obama was due to Cuyahoga County, a heavily Democratic area with a hotly contested race on the ballot."}
