{"The timeline discrepancy": "The expert notes that the Facebook post claiming Mugabe asked Amanpour about Queen Elizabeth was published in 2013, while the interview with Amanpour took place in 2009. This inconsistency suggests that the post is not accurately quoting from the interview.", "Lack of mention in the interview": "The expert points out that after listening to the full interview, Amanpour never asks Mugabe the question about Queen Elizabeth as it appears in the misleading post. Throughout the interview, there is no mention of Queen Elizabeth II, indicating that the claim is not supported by the actual interview.", "Focus on power retention": "The expert highlights that throughout the interview, Amanpour consistently asks Mugabe about his determination to hold onto power. She questions why he finds it difficult to leave power in a reasonable way and why he hangs on for so long. This emphasis on power retention contradicts the claim about Mugabe asking Amanpour about Queen Elizabeth.", "Mugabe": "s ousting in 2017: The expert mentions that Mugabe was finally ousted from power in November 2017 when his previously loyal military generals turned against him. This information further undermines the claim, as Mugabe's prolonged stay in power contradicts the idea that he questioned Amanpour about Queen Elizabeth's retirement plans."}
