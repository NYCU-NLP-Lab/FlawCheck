{"The existence of the radio interview and the statements attributed to Kellyanne Conway were investigated": "It was found that the interview and the radio station mentioned in the claim are completely fictional. The radio station does not exist, and Conway has not commented on the matter.", "The source of the claim": "USPOLN.com, was examined. It was discovered that USPOLN.com includes a disclaimer stating that the information it provides may not be reliable and that the articles should be considered satirical. This raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "The statement from the Golden State Warriors regarding their invitation to the White House was analyzed": "The Warriors stated that they had not been invited to the traditional White House ceremony, which contradicts the claim that Kellyanne Conway said she would \"make sure\" the Warriors were required to visit the White House.", "The statement made by Steve Kerr": "the head coach of the Golden State Warriors, was taken into consideration. Kerr expressed his criticism of President Trump and mentioned that the team had not been invited to the White House. This further undermines the credibility of the claim."}
