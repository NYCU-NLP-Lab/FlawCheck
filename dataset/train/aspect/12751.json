{"Lack of independent verification": "The expert's verdict highlights that the report provided by Judicial Watch lacked specific details that could be independently verified. The blurred image of children in a dirty bathroom was provided without any additional evidence or information to support its authenticity.", "Unanswered questions": "The expert reached out to Guatemalan police and Judicial Watch with a list of detailed questions about the source of the information. However, Judicial Watch's president, Tom Fitton, did not answer the questions and claimed that their source was confidential. The lack of transparency and willingness to address the questions raised concerns about the authenticity of the claim.", "No alternative sources": "The expert's investigation could not locate any other source that provided information or images related to the claim. Judicial Watch was the only organization that reported on the recovery of minors from human smugglers in the migrant caravan, making it difficult to corroborate the claim through other sources.", "Previous misleading report": "The expert mentions that Judicial Watch had previously published a misleading report, although the specific details of this report are not provided. This information raises doubts about the credibility of the organization and adds to the skepticism surrounding their claim regarding the rescued minors."}
