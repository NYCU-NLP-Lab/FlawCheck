The bank stated that they were unaware of any such research, but an economist from the bank, Pia Orrenius, mentioned that removing a million workers from the Texas labor force would lead to a contraction in economic activity.", "Southern Methodist University economist": "Another expert, Bernard Weinstein from Southern Methodist University, stated that he was not aware of any recent studies on the effects of deporting all unauthorized workers in Texas. However, he acknowledged that the large immigrant population, both legal and illegal, has contributed to the state's economic growth. He mentioned that while deporting all undocumented workers may not cause an outright recession, it would impose significant challenges on industries such as agriculture, hospitality, and residential construction.", "Study overseen by economist Ray Perryman": "The expert received information from the Texas Association of Business, which pointed out a study conducted by economist Ray Perryman.
