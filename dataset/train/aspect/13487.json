{"The survey was conducted by the Center for Security Policy": "a hawkish think tank, which may have a biased agenda and could influence the results of the survey.", "The survey was an online": "opt-in survey, which means that respondents chose to participate, leading to a potential self-selection bias and making the results less reliable.", "The survey was conducted among only 600 Muslims": "which may not be a representative sample of the entire U.S. Muslim population, and therefore, the results cannot be generalized to the entire population.", "The wording of the survey question itself may have influenced the responses": "as it asked whether violence against Americans can be justified as part of the global jihad, without providing any context or alternative options, potentially leading to skewed results."}
