Obama's aides confirmed that this statement was his most definitive judgment to date on the state of the economy.

The fact that the NBER has not officially declared a recession at that time is an important aspect to consider when verifying the claim.", "Definition of recession": "The expert's verdict mentions that there is a misconception about how recessions are defined.
