{"Comparison of temperatures": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim was verified by comparing the temperatures on Mars with the temperatures in parts of the United States and Canada during the polar vortex. This involved examining the recorded temperatures on Earth and the measurements taken by NASA's Curiosity rover on Mars.", "Expert consultation": "The expert's verdict states that the PolitiFact team reached out to scientists to gather their opinions and insights on the claim. This involved consulting with experts in aerospace engineering and planetary sciences, such as Ben Longmier from the University of Michigan and Samuel Kounaves from Tufts University.", "Analysis of temperature fluctuations": "The expert's verdict highlights that the temperatures on Mars fluctuate, similar to Earth. This aspect of temperature variation was taken into account to assess the authenticity of the claim. The expert's analysis considered the maximum ground temperature recorded by Curiosity and compared it to the temperatures experienced in cities like Minneapolis and Winnipeg during the polar vortex.", "Consideration of atmospheric temperatures": "The expert's verdict mentions that while the surface temperatures on Mars may be comparable to some of the coldest cities in the United States and Canada, the air temperature on Mars is much colder. The average air temperature on Mars was reported to be around minus 50 degrees Fahrenheit. This aspect of atmospheric temperature was considered to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the claim's authenticity."}
