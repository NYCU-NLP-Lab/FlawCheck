{"The claim states that starting in 2011": "individuals will be required to pay taxes on the value of health insurance provided by their employer. The expert's verdict confirms that this is partially true, as employers will be required to report the cost of insurance on W-2 forms, but the amount will not be taxed.", "The expert": "s verdict also mentions the tax on \"Cadillac\" or \"gold-plated\" health insurance policies, which are policies that cost significantly more than the national average. The W-2 reporting requirement will allow the IRS to more easily collect this tax."}
