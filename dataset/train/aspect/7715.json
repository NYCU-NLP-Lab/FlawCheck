{"Analysis of historical records": "The expert refers to a website that provides historical data on the length of the ice-cover season on the Madison lakes in Wisconsin. The records show a clear trend of fewer ice-cover days over time, with an average decrease of around 29-35 days over the past 150 years.", "Climate change models": "The expert mentions that climate change models predict warmer temperatures, which would lead to a trend towards fewer days of ice-covered lakes. The use of these models helps to verify the claim that ice fishermen in Wisconsin are already noticing fewer days they can be out on the ice-covered lakes.", "Expertise in limnology": "The expert interviewed for the verdict is identified as an expert on the effects of climate change on freshwater lakes. This expertise in the field of limnology adds credibility to the verification process and strengthens the authenticity of the claim.", "International research and collaboration": "The expert highlights that researchers from various countries, including Canada, Finland, Sweden, Russia, Japan, and Madison, have been studying lake ice for years. This international collaboration and research further support the claim that climate change is affecting the number of days ice fishermen can be out on the ice-covered lakes in Wisconsin."}
