{"Comparison to previous statistics": "The expert compared the claim made by Emma Watson to previous statistics and found that her figure of 15.5 million girls being married in the next 16 years was a significant undercount. They cited data from the UN Population Fund which projected that the rate of child marriage would rise to 15.1 million per year by 2030.", "Primary source of data": "The expert mentioned that the primary source behind the figures on child marriage is the UN Population Fund. They rely on data from the Demographic and Health Survey and the Multiple Indicators Cluster Survey, which provide generally reliable information on women between the ages of 20 and 24 in 48 developing nations.", "Methodology used to determine child marriage rates": "The expert explained the methodology used by the UN Population Fund to measure the prevalence of child marriage. They survey women who are 20 or older and ask them when they got married. By convention, anyone who marries under the age of 18 is considered to have wedded early. This methodology helps estimate the number of females who married young.", "Demographic factors influencing child marriage rates": "The expert mentioned that one of the reasons for the projected increase in child marriage rates is a demographic bubble moving through the system. They explained that many countries have young populations with larger cohorts of younger girls who may be at risk of child marriage in the next 16 years. This demographic factor contributes to the overall understanding of the issue."}
