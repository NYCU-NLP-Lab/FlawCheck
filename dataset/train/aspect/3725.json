{"Fact": "checkers have debunked the claim: The expert's verdict mentions that fact-checkers, including PolitiFact National, FactCheck.org, and Snopes.com, have all debunked the claim about Medicare insurance premiums rising to $120.20 per month in 2013 and $247.00 per month in 2014. This indicates that expert analysis and research have been conducted to verify the authenticity of the claim.", "Official reports contradict the claim": "The expert's verdict refers to Page 229 of the 2012 report from the board of trustees on Medicare, which states that the estimated standard monthly premium for 2013 will be around $109.10, not $120.20 as claimed. The report also projects annual increases through 2021, which range from 4.3 to 6.1 percent, contradicting the significant increase mentioned in the claim.", "Inaccurate information in the claim": "The expert's verdict points out that the claim provides incorrect information about the current and 2012 Medicare premiums. The claim states that the current monthly fee is $96.40, while it was actually the premium in 2009. Additionally, the claim states that the 2012 rate is $104.20, whereas it was actually $99.90.", "Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Alabama disavows the claim": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim carries the logo of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Alabama, giving it additional credibility. However, when contacted, a Blue Cross vice president confirms that the worker who forwarded the email did not assess whether it was true. This disavowal by a reputable insurance company indicates that the claim is not supported by reliable sources."}
