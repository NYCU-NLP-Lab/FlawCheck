{"Polygamy is illegal in the United States": "The expert's verdict clearly states that polygamy is illegal in the United States and the government only recognizes one legal spouse. This contradicts the claim that Muslim immigrants in Michigan can list multiple wives as \"extended family\" to qualify for welfare.", "Immigration process for spouses": "The expert explains that the immigration process for spouses is lengthy and complicated. Even if a man successfully sponsors his wife for an immigrant visa, only the first spouse may qualify as a spouse for immigration. This means that any additional wives would have to apply for an immigrant visa on their own, further debunking the claim.", "Welfare benefits for one wife only": "The expert points out that for welfare benefits, such as cash assistance and Medicaid, federal rules state that only one spouse can be claimed. This means that a Muslim man could not list his second, third, or fourth wives as \"extended family\" to receive extended benefits, as suggested in the claim.", "No unique welfare application in Michigan": "The expert clarifies that there is nothing unique about Michigan's welfare application compared to other states. The claim specifically targets Michigan, implying that it has special provisions that allow Muslim immigrants to exploit the system. However, the expert states that Michigan's welfare application process is similar to that of other states, further discrediting the claim."}
