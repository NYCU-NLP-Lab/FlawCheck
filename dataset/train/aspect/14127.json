{"Lack of credible evidence": "The expert's verdict highlights that the claim of sex traffickers tagging vehicles with codes such as \"1f1b\" is based on a photograph circulating on social media. However, there is no substantial evidence or credible source to support this claim.", "Origin of the claim": "The expert's analysis reveals that the claim originated from a social media post made by an individual who claimed that their friend had heard about this tactic from a random stranger. The lack of verifiable sources raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Inconsistent details": "The expert points out that as the claim spread, the details became increasingly unclear and muddled. Different individuals added their own interpretations and variations, such as the location of the incident being mentioned as Bricktown, Oklahoma City, despite the absence of a Walmart there. These inconsistencies further undermine the credibility of the claim.", "Lack of official reports": "The expert highlights that local law enforcement authorities, specifically the Brick Township Police Department, have stated that they have not received any reports or notifications regarding sex traffickers using such codes to tag vehicles. This official statement contradicts the claim and adds to the skepticism surrounding its authenticity."}
