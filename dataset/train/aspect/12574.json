However, there is no concrete evidence provided to support the claim that the boy was denied care for COVID-19 symptoms due to a lack of insurance. This aspect raises doubts about the accuracy of the claim.", "Death during transit to the hospital": "The claim states that the boy died on his way to the hospital while suffering from COVID-19 symptoms.
