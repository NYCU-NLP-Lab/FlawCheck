{"The claim is based on a Facebook post that includes a photo of child dancers and drag queen Alyssa Edwards": "along with the statement that the show is intended to make little boys into 'sexy' little girls.", "The post includes a link to the Netflix page for the show": "which provides a description that does not support the claim.

The show features children, both boys and girls, who are students at the Beyond Belief Dance Company. The photo in the Facebook post is a promo for the show, but most of the children in the shot are girls, not boys in drag.", "The expert": "s verdict, based on the evidence provided, rates the Facebook post as \"Pants on Fire!\" indicating that the claim is completely false."}
