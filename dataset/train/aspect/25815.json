{"The expert examined different measures of the money supply": "including M1, M2, and M0, to verify the claim. These measures represent different components of the money supply and provide different perspectives on its growth.", "The expert compared the growth rates of M1 and M2 from January to December 2009 and found that they did not double as claimed by Rep": "Ron Paul. This analysis provided evidence against the authenticity of the claim.", "The expert also considered the growth rate of M0": "which includes currency in circulation, bank vault money, and commercial bank deposits with the Federal Reserve. From January to December 2009, M0 grew by 19 percent, but over a longer period including the fall 2008 economic crisis response, it grew by 139 percent. This discrepancy was investigated to understand the reasons behind the differing growth rates.", "The expert consulted with economists": "such as Robert Barro from Harvard University, to gain insights into the slower growth rates of M1 and M2 compared to M0. It was discovered that financial institutions were holding excess reserves instead of lending the money, which explained the difference in growth rates among the different measures of the money supply."}
