{"Trump": "s motive and conspiracy theory: The expert's verdict mentions that Trump suggests the inflated death toll was a deliberate effort by the Democrats to make him look bad. He claims that any death, even if unrelated to the hurricanes, was added to the list, implying a political motive behind the increased death count.", "Discrepancy in initial death toll reports": "The expert mentions that during Trump's visit to Puerto Rico, officials briefed him that only 16 people had died from Hurricane Maria. However, over time, the death toll increased to 64, and then to 3,000. This discrepancy raises questions about the accuracy of the initial reports and the subsequent increase in the death count.", "Criticism of the method used to determine the death count": "Trump criticizes the method employed by George Washington University researchers to calculate the death count. He argues that this method was never used in previous hurricanes because other jurisdictions already knew the number of people killed. Trump questions how Puerto Rico officials could not have known the death count without relying on external research."}
