{"Lack of evidence": "The expert's verdict states that there is no evidence to support the claim that Nikita Khrushchev made the quoted statement about Americans and socialism. This lack of evidence is a significant aspect in verifying the authenticity of the claim.", "Attribution without proof": "The expert mentions that similar quotes have been attributed to Khrushchev without any proof for years. This suggests that the claim may be based on unsubstantiated attributions, further casting doubt on its authenticity.", "Inconsistent sources": "The expert mentions that the quote has been attributed to Khrushchev by various individuals, including President Ronald Reagan and Ezra Taft Benson. However, the fact that multiple sources have made similar attributions without providing concrete evidence adds to the uncertainty surrounding the claim.", "Unresponsiveness to request for evidence": "The expert states that they attempted to reach out to Nikki Haley, who made the claim on social media, to inquire about the evidence supporting it. However, Haley did not respond to the request for comment. This lack of response raises questions about the validity of the claim and the evidence backing it up."}
