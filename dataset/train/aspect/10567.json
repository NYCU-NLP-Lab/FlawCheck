{"Contacting the Nelson Mandela Foundation": "The expert reached out to the Nelson Mandela Foundation, which is considered a definitive resource on Mandela's life and speeches. They confirmed that the quote was not attributed to Mandela and could not be found in their collection of his speeches or authorized book of quotations.", "Researching the source of the quote": "The expert conducted an internet search and found that the quote was connected to Mohamad Safa, a human rights advocate and climate activist. Safa himself claimed that the quote was his and not Mandela's, and provided evidence of his own posts predating the circulation of the quote.", "Lack of alternative sources": "The expert found no other potential sources for the quote, further supporting the conclusion that it was not attributed to Mandela. The absence of any other references or attributions to Mandela using similar language also raised doubts about the authenticity of the quote.", "Unlikely language for Mandela": "Based on the expert's knowledge of Mandela's advocacy against racial or gender divisions, they deemed it highly unlikely that Mandela would have used the language in the quote. This assessment was based on the expert's understanding of Mandela's beliefs and principles, further undermining the claim's authenticity."}
