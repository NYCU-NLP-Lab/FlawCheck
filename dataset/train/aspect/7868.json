{"The claim is based on a letter sent by Sen": "John Cornyn, Gov. Greg Abbott, and Rep. Henry Cuellar to the Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson. The letter states that the Department of Homeland Security did not request any flight hours for Operation Phalanx from the Department of Defense for 2017.", "The claim is supported by the fact that Operation Phalanx is a border surveillance program launched in 2010": "in which National Guard officers assist U.S. agents in monitoring the U.S.-Mexico border. The claim suggests that the lack of request for flight hours indicates a reduction in surveillance and security resources.", "The claim is further supported by the statement that there has been a continuing surge of migrants along the Southern Border and a large uptick in apprehensions for the month of November 2016": "This suggests that increased surveillance and security resources are needed.", "The authenticity of the claim is also supported by the fact that Sen": "Cornyn and Rep. Cuellar were unable to provide confirmable evidence for their declaration that no flight hours were requested. However, Cuellar did bring attention to a letter sent by a border security official indicating support for the operation."}
