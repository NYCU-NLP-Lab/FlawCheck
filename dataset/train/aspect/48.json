{"The source of the claim": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim was published in a Facebook post on June 28, 2019, and has been shared more than 4,700 times. This indicates the source of the claim and its reach on social media.", "Caption and content of the post": "The caption of the Facebook post states \"New Road rules in QLD\" and provides a list of specific road rules and corresponding fines. The expert's verdict highlights the content of the post, including the specific fines mentioned and their descriptions.", "Confirmation from Queensland Department of Transport and Main Roads": "TMR): The expert's verdict mentions that a TMR spokesperson confirmed that the road rules mentioned in the Facebook post are not new and have been covered by various transport regulations for some time. They also confirmed that the fines listed in the post are outdated.", "Comparison of penalty rates": "The TMR spokesperson provided information that the fines quoted in the misleading Facebook post are penalty rates from the 2013/14 financial year, which are no longer applicable. They further explained that the current penalty rates came into effect on July 1 of the current year and are subject to annual increases based on government indexation rates. This comparison of penalty rates helps verify the inauthenticity of the claim."}
