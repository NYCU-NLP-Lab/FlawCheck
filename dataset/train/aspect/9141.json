{"The word": "pandemicide\" gained widespread attention in February 2021 when journalist Laurie Garrett used it to describe former U.S. President Donald Trump's \"negligence\" in the final weeks of his presidency, resulting in a massive number of coronavirus deaths in the U.S.", "The earliest known use of the word": "pandemicide\" was found in an academic journal from August 2020. However, this article was not specifically about Trump's pandemic response.", "Social media users shared an article published by Foreign Policy magazine in February 2021": "where Laurie Garrett accused Trump of \"pandemicide.\" The article was also shared by Trump's niece, Mary Trump, who is a psychologist and a critic of her uncle.", "While the term": "pandemicide\" was not invented by Garrett, there were no references to it before the era of the Trump presidency. A Google search, newspaper archives, and consulted dictionaries did not show any previous usage of the word to describe historical events. However, the term has been used by at least four authors on three previous occasions, albeit relatively recent to the time of writing."}
