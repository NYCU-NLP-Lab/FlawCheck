{"Expert": "s statement: The expert, Scott Kraus, states that the claim of a third whale holding up mating whales is entirely fictional and makes no sense biologically. This contradicts the claim's authenticity.", "Reference to scientific literature": "Quoting from the book \"Gray Whales\" by David G. Gordon and Alan Baldridge, a New York Times Q&A mentions that two courting bulls often follow the same cow, forming tightly knit trios. This suggests that the behavior described in the claim may not be accurate.", "Dismissal of the idea": "The Times article states that the concept of extra males holding mating whales together to brace them has been mostly dismissed as a misinterpretation of the mating process. This further questions the authenticity of the claim.", "Different behavior among whale species": "The Smithsonian Magazine article highlights that male humpback whales engage in violent and competitive behavior to vie for female attention. This behavior contrasts with the claim of a third whale altruistically assisting in mating. Thus, the claim's authenticity is undermined by the diverse behaviors observed among whale species."}
