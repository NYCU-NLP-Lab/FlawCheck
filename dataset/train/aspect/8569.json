{"The anonymous chain email presents a": "gotcha\"-style quiz that lists six quotations and asks which famous communist said it. The options include Karl Marx, Josef Stalin, Mao Tse-tung, and other Nazis, fascists, and dictators. The fact that communism and Nazism are completely different political philosophies is mentioned as a minor quibble.", "The quiz includes a": "none of the above\" option for every quotation, and at the end of the quiz, it reveals that all the answers are \"none of the above\" and attributes those statements to Hillary Clinton. This approach creates a misleading and deceptive presentation.", "The problem with the quiz is that every statement is taken out of context or edited to look worse than it is": "The circumstances of Clinton's statements do not involve advocating communist-style government for the United States or socialistic economic policies. In some instances, she was criticizing government spending or the excesses of Big Business, while in others, she was emphasizing the need for political consensus on complicated issues.", "Two specific examples are provided to illustrate the misrepresentation of Clinton": "s statements. In one instance, the chain email quotes Clinton saying, \"We're going to take things away from you on behalf of the common good.\" However, the full quote reveals that she was discussing the need to end the Bush tax cuts to balance the budget and was not advocating taking things away from individuals. In another example, the email quotes Clinton saying, \"It's time for a new beginning, for an end to government of the few, by the few, and for the few. ... And to replace it with shared responsibility for shared prosperity.\" However, the omitted phrases in the chain email quote show that Clinton was criticizing specific economic policies of the Bush administration, not advocating for communism."}
