{"Lack of peer": "reviewed scientific literature: The expert notes that there is a remarkable dearth of peer-reviewed scientific literature on the topic of \"blue balls\" or epididymal hypertension. This suggests that the authenticity of the claim may be difficult to verify due to the limited scientific research available.", "Speculative explanations": "The expert mentions that case reports and speculative essays have been published on the topic, indicating that there are various theories and explanations for the phenomenon. This suggests that the understanding of the mechanism behind \"blue balls\" is still lacking and not universally agreed-upon.", "Increased distension of epididymis": "One speculative paper suggests that epididymal hypertension may be related to an increased distension of the epididymis or pelvic venous dilatation. This aspect highlights a possible physiological factor that could contribute to the pain experienced.", "Pressure build": "up and congestion: The expert explains that prolonged arousal without release leads to an increase in blood flow to the genital region, including the testicles. This increased stimulation and fluid production can cause pressure build-up and congestion within the testicles, leading to pain. This aspect emphasizes the physiological process that may underlie the claim."}
