{"The misleading nature of the claim": "The expert's verdict highlights that the claim made in the ad is misleading because it falsely implies that Obama and Biden separated families and put children in cages as a blanket policy, when in reality, the images shown are of minors who were temporarily detained after crossing the border without a parent or guardian.", "Lack of a blanket policy": "The expert's verdict states that while some families were separated under the Obama administration, there was no blanket policy to criminally prosecute parents and separate them from their children, as was implemented in the early days of the Trump administration.", "Rare occurrences of family separations": "The expert's verdict cites a 2019 report from the Department of Health and Human Services' inspector general, which states that historically, family separations were rare and occurred due to specific circumstances such as a parent's medical emergency or a determination that the parent was a threat to the child's safety.", "Context of the ad and its target audience": "The expert's verdict mentions that the ad attacking Biden was aired in Nevada, where a significant portion of the population is Hispanic or Latino. This context suggests that the ad was strategically designed to appeal to Hispanic voters by using misleading imagery and claims about immigration policies."}
