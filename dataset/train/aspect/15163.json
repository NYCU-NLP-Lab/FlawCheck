{"The timing of the call": "The expert mentioned that the claim was about winning Wisconsin \"not so late in the evening\" and \"a little bit early in the evening.\" They verified the authenticity of this aspect by providing information on the actual call times made by different news networks, such as the Associated Press and CNN.", "Comparison with other states": "The expert highlighted that Wisconsin was not the first state to have its polls closed on Election Day 2016. They compared the call times for Wisconsin with the call times for other states that closed their polls at the same time, to determine if Wisconsin had an \"early\" call.", "The final margin of victory": "The expert mentioned the final margin of victory in Wisconsin, which was over 22,748 votes, with Trump winning 47.2% to Clinton's 46.5%. This information helps verify the claim that Wisconsin was won \"a little bit early in the evening\" because a close margin of victory could suggest a longer time for the call to be made.", "Fox News as an outlier": "The expert mentioned that Fox News called the race for Trump at 10:30 p.m., which was three-and-a-half hours after the polls closed. This information contrasts with the other networks' call times and suggests that Fox News was an outlier in terms of the timing of their call for Wisconsin."}
