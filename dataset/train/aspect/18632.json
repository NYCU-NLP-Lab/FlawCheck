{"Jeff Greene": "s claim that Florida taxpayers are paying for Trump's golf trips is supported by the fact that the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office has spent millions on security for Trump's visits. This aspect verifies the claim that taxpayer money is being used for Trump's visits.", "However": "the claim is incomplete as it fails to mention that the federal government has already reimbursed local law enforcement agencies for protecting Trump. This aspect contradicts the claim that Florida taxpayers are directly paying for Trump's visits.", "Greene": "s spokeswoman pointed to a Palm Beach Post article that found local law enforcement agencies fronted more than $5.7 million to help protect Trump between November 2017 and April 2018. This aspect further supports the claim that taxpayer money is being used for Trump's visits.", "The Presidential Residence Protection Assistance Grant provided": "41 million to reimburse state and local law enforcement agencies for costs incurred while protecting Trump's residences in Florida, New York, and New Jersey. This aspect reinforces the fact that the federal government has already provided funds to cover the expenses of protecting Trump during his visits."}
