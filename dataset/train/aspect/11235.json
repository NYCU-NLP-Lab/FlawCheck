{"Lack of evidence": "The expert's verdict states that there is no evidence to support the claim that Evolution Fresh brand cold-pressed juices and smoothies are \"poison.\" This lack of evidence suggests that the claim is likely false.", "Official brand confirmation": "A representative from Evolution Fresh confirms that the product has undergone no recent recalls and the company has received no reports of people getting sick from the juice. This confirmation adds credibility to the authenticity of the brand and further disproves the claim.", "Limited distribution": "The expert's verdict mentions that Evolution Fresh products are currently sold only in Starbucks locations in the United States and Canada, as well as some U.S. grocery stores. The claim suggests that the products are sold or manufactured in Nigeria, which contradicts the limited distribution information provided by the brand representative. This inconsistency casts doubt on the claim's authenticity.", "Previous incident clarification": "The expert's verdict mentions a previous incident involving a woman accused of tampering with Evolution Fresh drink bottles in a Starbucks store. However, subsequent lab tests found that the bottles contained vinegar, not a harmful substance. This clarification highlights that the incident was unrelated to the claim of the products being \"poison\" and further discredits the claim's authenticity."}
