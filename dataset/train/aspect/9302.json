{"Comparison of terminology": "The expert notes that there is a distinction between the term \"families\" used in the data cited by the websites and the term \"households\" used by Pence. The expert explains that while there are differences between the two measures, the percentages of families and households without any workers are relatively close.", "Contextual analysis": "The expert highlights that Pence's claim fails to consider that many households without a working member consist of retired senior citizens.

Although they couldn't find the exact figure, they reverse-engineered it using assumptions and expert advice to provide an estimate.", "Verification of underlying method": "The expert states that they streamlined the math and made assumptions to estimate the percentage of households headed by someone 65 or older.
