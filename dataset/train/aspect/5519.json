{"Partisan narratives after the Benghazi attacks": "The expert mentions that the claim is part of the partisan narratives that emerged after the Benghazi attacks. Republicans criticized the initial characterization of events by U.N. ambassador Susan Rice, while Democrats argued that the attack was not a surprise due to cuts in embassy security funding driven by the GOP.", "Ronan Farrow": "s discussion on embassy security: Ronan Farrow, a former director of global youth issues under former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, highlighted embassy security issues in a 2013 story for The Atlantic. He mentioned Clinton's warnings in 2011 about the potential negative impact of funding cuts on national security. Farrow reiterated these concerns in a segment on his MSNBC show in 2014.", "Congressional budget cuts": "Farrow asked Rep. Adam Schiff if House Republicans \"erred\" in cutting $128 million from the administration's request for embassy security funding in 2011. Farrow also mentioned that in 2010, Democrats cut $142 million from security requests. The expert's verdict suggests that these budget cuts contributed to the security failures in Benghazi.", "Verification of budget cuts": "The expert mentions the difficulty in verifying the exact numbers and figures provided by Farrow. They explain that Congress' budget strategies like \"continuing resolutions\" and sequestration make it challenging to determine the precise budget cuts. However, they provide figures from the Congressional Research Service to analyze total security spending, which includes embassy facility security and officer positions."}
