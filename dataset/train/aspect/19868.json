{"The absence of evidence": "Despite the claims made on social media, there is no concrete evidence to support the allegation that online retailer Wayfair is trafficking children.", "Wayfair": "s response: Wayfair spokesperson Jane Carpenter categorically denied the claims, stating that there is no truth to them. Carpenter explained that the products in question are industrial grade cabinets that are accurately priced and that they have been temporarily removed from the site for renaming and clarification of the pricing.", "Explanation of product naming": "Carpenter further explained that Wayfair uses an algorithm to name its products, which incorporates first names, geographic locations, and common words. This practice is common in retail and is the reason why some of the products were named with human first names.", "Debunking of specific cases": "The claim tied various products on Wayfair to the names of children who were allegedly missing. However, investigations revealed that many of these children, such as Samiyah Mumin and Tori Dunning, are not currently missing. Law enforcement authorities and individuals themselves have debunked these specific cases, confirming that it is a hoax."}
