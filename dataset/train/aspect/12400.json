{"Comparison of donor lists": "The expert compared the top five donors for Mitt Romney and Barack Obama to verify the claim. They examined the Facebook post and cross-referenced the information with OpenSecrets.org, a nonpartisan campaign finance database.", "Accuracy of the Facebook post": "The expert acknowledged that the accuracy of the claim depended on when the Facebook list was compiled. They found that as of April 27, 2012, the top contributors listed on OpenSecrets.org closely matched the Facebook post for both candidates.", "Matching donors": "The expert found that five out of the top six contributors for both Romney and Obama matched between the Facebook post and OpenSecrets.org. This supported the claim that Romney's top donors were Wall Street firms, while Obama's top donors were technology companies and universities.", "Inaccurate description": "The expert identified a discrepancy in the description of one of the donors. They noted that DLA Piper was not accurately described as a \"legal group specializing in technology\" but rather as a global law firm that also engages in lobbying activities. This highlights the need for accurate and precise descriptions when analyzing donor lists."}
