{"The claim is supported by a statement from President Obama himself during an interview where he defended his record on serving veterans": "specifically mentioning the reduction in homelessness among veterans by a third.", "The claim is further supported by the statement from the National Alliance to End Homelessness": "an independent agency dedicated to fighting homelessness, which states that there has been a 33 percent decrease in the number of homeless veterans since 2010.", "The claim is also backed by the yearly": "point in time\" count of homeless veterans conducted by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The 2014 report showed a 32.57 percent decrease in homeless veterans compared to the 2009 count.", "The consistency of the": "point in time\" count since 2009 suggests that the decline in homelessness among veterans is not solely dependent on the national economic recovery, but rather a result of targeted efforts and initiatives."}
