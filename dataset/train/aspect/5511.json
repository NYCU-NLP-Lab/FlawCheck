{"The claim is supported by a press release from the Lone Star Project": "a Democratic-backed organization, which states that Pete Sessions has held at least two fundraisers at adult-themed clubs and made no apologies.", "The claim is backed up by a video uploaded to YouTube by the Lone Star Project": "showing scenes from Forty Deuce, a Las Vegas club where Sessions confirmed he held an event in 2007. The video serves as visual evidence of the claim.", "The video includes a sound clip from the American Public Media radio show Marketplace": "where Sessions himself acknowledges doing a Las Vegas fundraiser every year and refers to Forty Deuce as a \"burlesque show\" without nudity.", "An undated promotional advertisement for Forty Deuce describes the club as a": "World-Famous Burlesque,\" which aligns with Sessions' characterization of the venue and supports the claim that it is an adult-themed club."}
