A spokesman for the ministry echoed Ahmadinejad's claim, stating that the controversy over Ashtiani's stoning sentence was organized media propaganda against Iran.", "Ongoing investigation": "The third aspect is the acknowledgment of an ongoing investigation by Iranian officials. They have made it clear that the case involving Ashtiani is still under investigation, and no final sentence has been issued yet on the charges of adultery and being an accomplice in the killing of her husband.", "Contradictory statements": "The fourth aspect is the contradictory statements from Iranian justice officials.
