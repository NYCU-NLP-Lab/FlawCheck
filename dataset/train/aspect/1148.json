{"Lack of credible sources": "The claim did not provide any credible sources or references to support the assertion that there was an effort to lower the age of consent to four years old. Without reliable sources, it is difficult to verify the authenticity of the claim.", "State": "by-state basis: The expert found that the age of consent in the United States is decided on a state-by-state basis and typically ranges from 16 to 18 years old. They found no evidence of any serious or widespread effort in any state to modify the age of consent to include children as young as four.", "Misinterpretation of California law": "Some commenters attempted to associate the claim with California's SB 145, but the expert clarified that this law does not affect the age of consent in the state. SB 145 allows certain individuals convicted of sex offenses involving minors to apply for discretionary relief from having to register as sex offenders, but it does not change the age of consent.", "Co": "opting of a hashtag: The \"SaveOurChildren\" hashtag used in the claim was originally created to raise awareness of child sex trafficking. However, it has been co-opted by followers of the QAnon conspiracy theory, which falsely alleges a global pedophile ring led by prominent Democrats. This co-opting of the hashtag raises questions about the credibility of the claim and its sources."}
