{"Lack of verification": "The Instagram account (@jimcarreyhere) posting the quote attributed to Marcus Aurelius is not verified with a blue checkmark, unlike the official Twitter account of Jim Carrey.", "Inaccurate illustration": "The illustration accompanying the Instagram post does not resemble Marcus Aurelius but instead resembles Caracalla, another Roman Emperor. This raises doubts about the authenticity of the quote.", "Absence of credible citation": "Despite searching online versions of Marcus Aurelius's book \"Meditations,\" no evidence of the quote was found. Additionally, no credible citation showing that Marcus Aurelius said the quote could be found.", "Questionable translation": "While a philosophy professor mentioned the possibility of the quote being a creative translation or paraphrase from a passage in \"Meditations,\" it was noted that the translation provided was old-fashioned and poor. This further casts doubt on the authenticity of the claim."}
