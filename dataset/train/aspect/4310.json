{"Lack of factual evidence": "The expert's verdict highlights that the claims made by YourNewsWire and Exopolitics lack factual evidence. They state that there is no scientific data linking the surge in volcanic activity in Hawaii to increased fracking activity from the geothermal energy plant.", "Inaccurate understanding of geologic events": "The expert's verdict points out that YourNewsWire misrepresents the volcanic activity in Hawaii by suggesting it is a new eruptive event caused by fracking. In reality, the volcanic activity is a continuation of an eruptive event that began in 1983.", "Nonexistent fracking activity in Hawaii": "The expert's verdict clarifies that fracking, a process used for extracting petroleum products, does not occur in Hawaii due to the absence of petroleum reserves. The claim's assertion that increased fracking activity at the geothermal energy plant caused the volcanic activity is therefore baseless.", "Misinterpretation of geothermal energy operations": "The expert's verdict explains that the processes employed at the Puna Geothermal Venture (PGV) are not equivalent to fracking, as claimed by Exopolitics. The geothermal plant operates by re-injecting a liquid into the ground, which is different from the high-pressure injection of fluids used in fracking."}
