{"Lack of evidence in the advertised story": "The expert notes that the advertised story mentioned nothing about Meghan Markle's net worth, which was claimed in the false online advertisement. This lack of evidence raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Presence of outdated and unproven stories": "The expert mentions encountering outdated stories about the Duchess of Cambridge and an unproven story about Prince Charles and baby Archie. The presence of such stories suggests a pattern of misinformation and raises questions about the credibility of the claim about Prince Harry and Meghan Markle.", "Inconsistencies in the actual story": "The expert highlights that the 41-page story on TheFashionBall.com, which was supposed to reveal Prince Harry's admission about Meghan Markle not being \"the one,\" did not contain any such information. This inconsistency undermines the credibility of the claim.", "Lack of proper sourcing and reliability of the publication": "The expert points out that the article lacked proper sourcing, citing an example where The Daily Mail, a tabloid considered unreliable, was referenced. The expert also mentions the ban on The Daily Mail as a source on Wikipedia due to its reputation for poor fact-checking and sensationalism. This lack of reliable sourcing further raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim."}
