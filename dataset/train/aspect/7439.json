{"The claim is supported by the statement made by Mandy Cohen": "the secretary of the N.C. Department of Health and Human Services, who mentioned that Vice President Mike Pence expanded Medicaid when he was the governor of Indiana.", "The spokesperson for Mandy Cohen": "s office referenced the website for Indiana's health care program to further support the claim.", "The agreement between then": "Indiana Governor Pence and the Obama administration to expand Medicaid under a custom program known as the \"new Healthy Indiana Plan\" also verifies the authenticity of the claim.", "The fact that Indiana": "s health care website describes the program as a \"homegrown consumer-driven health care coverage program for low-income adults\" instead of explicitly mentioning Medicaid expansion indicates that the claim is accurate."}
