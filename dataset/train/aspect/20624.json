{"Testimonials and personal experiences": "The claim was supported by testimonials and personal experiences of individuals who have traveled to Canada to purchase insulin at a significantly lower cost. This included tweets from diabetes activist Quinn Nystrom and statements made by participants of organized drug-buying trips.", "Price comparison": "The claim was verified by comparing the prices of insulin in the United States and Canada. The specific example of a group insulin order costing $23,789.24 in the US and $1,924.10 in Canada was provided, highlighting the drastic price difference.", "Expert analysis": "The expert mentioned the increasing gap between list prices and actual discounted prices in the pharmaceutical industry, with insulin being cited as a prime example. This analysis supports the claim that Americans can save a significant amount by purchasing insulin in Canada.", "Insurance and negotiation factors": "The expert mentioned that Americans can avoid paying the full price for prescription drugs through insurance coverage and negotiated prices. This suggests that the claim of Americans traveling to Canada for cheaper insulin is plausible, as insurance coverage in the US may not provide the same affordability."}
