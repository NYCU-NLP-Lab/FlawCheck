{"Comparison of reported viewership numbers": "The expert compared the claim's statement that the Democratic debate had 2.3 million viewers and the Trump rally had 6.7 million viewers with the actual reported numbers from CNN, which stated that the debate had an average of 7.3 million television viewers and 4 million live starts on CNN's platforms.", "Analysis of broadcasting coverage": "The expert analyzed the broadcasting coverage of the Trump rally to determine the potential reach and viewership. It was found that Fox Business channel aired the rally in its entirety, while Fox News channel aired parts of it. MSNBC and ABC did not air the rally live on television, and viewer numbers were not provided.", "Lack of official viewership numbers": "The expert noted that neither the White House nor Trump's 2020 re-election campaign provided official viewership numbers for the Trump rally, making it difficult to verify the claim accurately.", "Discrepancies in available data": "The expert highlighted the discrepancies in the available data, such as differing viewership numbers from different channels and the lack of response from CBS and NBC regarding their airing of the rally. This suggests that obtaining a definitive and accurate viewership count for the Trump rally is challenging."}
