{"The claim is supported by numbers from the U": "S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, which show that the number of unemployed people in Tennessee nearly doubled during Phil Bredesen's time as governor.", "The Republican post acknowledges that the claim refers to the number of Tennesseans on unemployment": "which may not accurately represent the total number of unemployed people due to eligibility criteria and expired benefits.", "The claim overlooks the impact of the Great Recession": "a global economic collapse that affected every state and nation, leading to a significant increase in unemployment rates nationwide, including in Tennessee.", "The Republican post fails to mention that": "before the recession, Bredesen oversaw a net increase in jobs in the state, including the creation of 2,000 new jobs through Volkswagen's investment in a new plant in Chattanooga."}
