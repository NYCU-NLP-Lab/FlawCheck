{"The claim made by Dan McCready that": "Dan Bishop doubles down on removing coverage for people with pre-existing conditions\" was based on his tweet on August 8th, where he accused Bishop of supporting health-care policies that don't protect individuals with pre-existing conditions.", "The claim was linked to the Small Business Health Care Act": "also known as Senate Bill 86, which was recently passed by the legislature and sent to Governor Roy Cooper for approval. McCready argued that this bill, sponsored by Bishop, would result in the removal of coverage for people with pre-existing conditions.", "The expert": "s investigation into the details of the bill revealed that while it allowed for the offering of skimpy coverage as part of the proposed new health plans, McCready's claim of \"removing coverage\" for individuals with pre-existing conditions was deemed an exaggeration.", "It was found that Bishop": "s bill, SB 86, explicitly stated that association health plans would be subject to the Affordable Care Act's \"group health plan\" requirements. This means that insurers cannot deny coverage to individuals with pre-existing conditions, cannot impose limits on certain benefits, and must provide free access to certain preventative services."}
