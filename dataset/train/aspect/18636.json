{"The claim is made by the Campaign for Liberty": "an organization founded by former U.S. Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, known for promoting limited government and opposition to the Federal Reserve System.", "The claim is based on a graph by the Heritage Foundation": "a conservative advocacy and research organization, showing the estimated costs and savings Virginia would experience through 2022 if it expanded Medicaid.", "Kaiser": "a reputable research organization, has also estimated the total added costs each state would incur from 2013 through 2022 if they expanded Medicaid, including Virginia.", "The main reason for the increase in costs is that Virginia would begin to assume a small share of the cost of insuring new enrollees starting in 2017": "with the state's share capping at 10 percent in 2020, while the federal government pays the rest."}
