{"In a July 2020 report": "the National Conference of State Legislatures stated that in 47 states, the maximum age of juvenile court jurisdiction is 17, indicating that 17-year-olds are not automatically treated as adults in the criminal justice system in most states.", "The law firm Gimbel": "Reilly, Guerin and Brown LLP mentioned in a blog entry from June 2018 that Wisconsin was one of just nine states that prosecuted all 17-year-olds as adults. However, this information is outdated as legislative changes have occurred since then.", "State Rep": "LaKeshia Myers, D-Milwaukee, commended Gov. Tony Evers on his proposed changes to the juvenile justice system, including raising the age for automatically charging someone as an adult from 17 to 18. This suggests that Wisconsin currently treats 17-year-olds as adults in the criminal justice system.", "Multiple articles": "including one from the Wisconsin Bar Association and another from the Appleton Post Crescent, have stated that Wisconsin is one of the nine states that automatically treats 17-year-olds as adults in the criminal justice system. However, these articles may not reflect the most current information on the topic."}
