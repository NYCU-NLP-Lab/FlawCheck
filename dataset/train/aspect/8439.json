{"The online advertisement featured a photograph of Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves and claimed that Reeves was Bullock": "s son. However, this claim was proven false by the expert's verdict.", "The misleading online advertisement led to a slideshow article with almost 200 pages": "with Bullock's page near the end of the story. Readers had to click \"next page\" around 190 times to reach it, indicating that the claim was buried deep within the article.", "The expert pointed out that Bullock and Reeves were born in the same year": "1964, and have even appeared in movies together, such as \"Speed\" and \"The Lake House.\" This information contradicts the claim that Reeves is Bullock's son, as it is unlikely for them to have had kissing scenes if they were indeed mother and son.", "The ad claimed that Bullock": "s son would look \"familiar\" to readers, but the expert stated that it is unlikely for anyone to recognize her children because they are not public figures. This further discredits the authenticity of the claim."}
