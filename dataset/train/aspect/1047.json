{"Lack of evidence": "The expert's verdict states that there is no evidence to support the claim that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said \"owning guns is not a right.\" This lack of evidence is a crucial aspect in verifying the authenticity of the claim.", "Ocasio": "Cortez's stance on gun control: The expert mentions that since joining Congress, Ocasio-Cortez has supported gun control measures, such as co-sponsoring legislation for universal background checks and advocating for bans on certain firearms. This information contradicts the claim that she would make a statement against gun ownership rights.", "Recognition of the Second Amendment": "The expert highlights that Ocasio-Cortez, as a candidate, recognized the Second Amendment to the Constitution, which protects the individual right to possess firearms for lawful purposes. This recognition further undermines the claim made in the meme.", "Inaccurate attribution and spread of misinformation": "The expert notes that the false quote attributed to Ocasio-Cortez has been spread through social media posts since at least January. The fact that the quote is inaccurately attributed and has been widely shared adds to the evidence against its authenticity."}
