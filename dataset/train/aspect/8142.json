Joe Manchin and claimed he owned a \"$700,000 D.C. luxury yacht.\" This claim was supported by a photograph showing a docked vessel.", "The authenticity of the claim was verified by the fact that Sen": "Manchin's campaign did not dispute his ownership of a boat named \"Almost Heaven,\" which he typically lived on when in Washington.", "The NRSC provided PolitiFact with a document labeled": "general index or abstract of title continuation sheet No. 1,\" which listed the cost of the vessel as $700,000.
