{"Definition of the Buffett Rule": "The expert mentions that there is a discrepancy between Vice President Joe Biden's speech and the White House website regarding the definition of the Buffett Rule. Biden's speech states that no one making a million dollars or more will pay an effective tax rate lower than 30 percent, while the website defines the rule as no household making more than $1 million each year should pay a smaller share of their income in taxes than a middle-class family pays.", "Operational details of the Buffett Rule": "The expert points out that the White House has provided additional operational details elsewhere, confirming that the 30 percent tax rate is indeed what the rule would require. The president's fiscal year 2013 budget proposal states that those making over $1 million should pay no less than 30 percent of their income in taxes.", "Implementation and equity considerations": "The expert mentions that the administration will work to ensure that the Buffett Rule is implemented in an equitable manner, including not disadvantaging individuals who make large charitable contributions. This aspect highlights the intention to address potential concerns and ensure fairness in the implementation of the rule.", "Comparison with existing tax rates": "The expert states that Biden's claim that the 30 percent tax rate is lower than the prescribed tax rate for millionaires already, including people making over $200,000, is a complicated question to answer. This aspect suggests that further analysis is required to determine the accuracy of Biden's statement and compare the proposed tax rate with the existing tax rates for millionaires and high-income earners."}
