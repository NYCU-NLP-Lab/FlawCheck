This raises concerns about the reliability and accuracy of the survey results.", "The expert highlights that the Rasmussen poll did not define the terms": "capitalism\" and \"socialism\" for the participants, which could have led to a lack of understanding and potentially skewed the responses.", "The expert provides the breakdown of the survey results for adults under 30": "showing that 37 percent preferred capitalism, 33 percent preferred socialism, and 30 percent were undecided.
