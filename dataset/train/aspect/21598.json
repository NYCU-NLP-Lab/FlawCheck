{"Comparison of mortality rates": "The expert compared the mortality rate of the flu to the estimated global mortality rate of the coronavirus outbreak. This involved analyzing data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) to determine the mortality rates for both illnesses.", "Calculation of flu mortality rate": "The expert, Christopher Mores, calculated the average, 10-year mortality rate for the flu using CDC data. He found that the rate was 0.1%, which is a commonly cited figure among experts. This calculation provided a baseline for comparison with the coronavirus mortality rate.", "Verification of coronavirus mortality rate": "The expert referred to statistics released by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, which reported a mortality rate of 2.3% for the coronavirus based on cases reported through a specific date. However, the expert also pointed out limitations in the data, including the vague definition of who has been infected by the virus.", "Understanding the significance of the numbers": "The expert, Dr. Amesh Adalja, provided context for the mortality rates by describing the 0.1% figure for the flu as the \"canonical seasonal influenza mortality figure.\" Additionally, it was emphasized that even though the percentage may seem small, the flu is still responsible for a significant number of deaths annually (30,000 to 40,000).
