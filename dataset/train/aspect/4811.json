This lack of evidence undermines the authenticity of Cruz's claim.", "Historical context of Chamberlain": "s appeasement policy: The expert's verdict highlights the historical context of Chamberlain's appeasement policy towards Hitler. Chamberlain's aim was to avert another war and he believed that diplomacy and appeasement could prevent a showdown with Germany. This contradicts Cruz's claim that Chamberlain told the British people to accept Nazi domination because they couldn't stand against them.", "Chamberlain": "s actions and response to German aggression: The expert's verdict mentions that Chamberlain's policy of appeasement culminated in the Munich Agreement, where Britain and France accepted the cession of the Sudetenland to Germany. However, when Hitler annexed the rest of Czech lands and invaded Poland, Chamberlain responded with a declaration of war on Germany. This contradicts Cruz's claim that Chamberlain advocated for accepting Nazi domination.", "Consensus among historians": "The expert's verdict states that four historians, including three based in England, unanimously agreed that Cruz's claim was inaccurate. These historians assert that Chamberlain did not tell the British people to accept Nazi domination because they couldn't stand against them.
