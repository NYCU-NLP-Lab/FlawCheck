{"The claim is based on a tweet from November 8": "2014, which stated that the Kenosha casino, backed by the Seminole Tribe, would send a majority of its revenue to Florida. This tweet was subsequently removed, but similar statements remained in the organization's feed for the previous two months. The presence of these statements on social media suggests that it was one aspect used to verify the authenticity of the claim.", "The financial figures provided by the Menominee tribe and Hard Rock International were analyzed to determine the potential revenue that the Kenosha casino could generate": "Both the Enough Already group and the casino backers agreed on an estimated revenue range, with figures ranging from $410 million to $436.7 million per year. These figures were used to assess whether a majority of the revenue would go to Florida.", "The spokesperson for Enough Already": "Brian Nemoir, initially made a statement that the money generated by the casino would be sent to Florida. However, when asked for evidence to support this claim, he walked back the statement and clarified that the money would be sent out of state, not just to Florida. This clarification and the spokesperson's response were likely considered as aspects to verify the authenticity of the claim.", "The involvement of Hard Rock International": "which is owned by the Seminole tribe of Florida, in the development and management of the Kenosha casino was also taken into account. The fact that a Florida-based tribe was directly involved in the project could be seen as supporting the claim that a significant portion of the revenue would be sent to Florida."}
