{"The Alberta Health Ministry and Alberta Health Services both discredited Dr": "Hodkinson's claims and stated that he does not have any formal affiliation with them. This verifies that his views are not supported by the health authorities.", "The Alberta Medical Association": "specifically the Alberta Section of Laboratory Physicians, also stated that they do not share Dr. Hodkinson's views and endorsed the use of masks, hand washing, and physical distancing to prevent the spread of Covid-19. This provides further evidence against his claims.", "The Royal College supports the public health advice given by the Chief Public Health Officer of Canada": "which includes recommendations to practice physical distancing and wear masks. This contradicts Dr. Hodkinson's assertion that the pandemic is a hoax.", "The comparison of death rates between the flu and Covid": "19 proves that Dr. Hodkinson's claim that Covid-19 is just a bad flu season is false. The World Health Organization states that the flu kills between 290,000 and 650,000 people globally each year, while Covid-19 has already caused over 1.4 million deaths worldwide. Additionally, the president of the Alberta section of Laboratory Physicians emphasized that Covid-19 is a novel virus that our immune system has not encountered before, indicating that it is more than just a simple flu."}
