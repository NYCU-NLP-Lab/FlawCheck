{"The claim was based on data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics": "which is the federal government's clearinghouse for employment statistics. This suggests that the claim was supported by official data and not just anecdotal evidence.", "The claim was also supported by a report from The Business Journals": "which identified Texas as the leader in job creation. This adds credibility to the claim as it is backed by a reputable source.", "The expert": "s research also pointed out that the claim made by Gov. McDonnell was not entirely accurate. While Texas did create a substantial number of jobs, the claim ignored job losses in other states and failed to account for job gains in states with positive growth. This shows that the expert critically evaluated the claim and provided a balanced assessment of its accuracy."}
