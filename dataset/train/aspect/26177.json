{"Testimonials from salon professionals": "The expert reached out to a colorist with extensive experience in hair color and highlight foils, who stated that they had never encountered a reaction like the one described with Pantene products. Additionally, several salon representatives from high-volume salons in New York City also confirmed that they had never seen or heard of such a reaction occurring with Pantene products.", "Lack of widespread reports on social media": "Despite the popularity of Pantene products and the common practice of highlighting hair, there were no widespread reports or stories on social media about foils heating up and smoking when using Pantene shampoo and conditioner. This suggests that the claim may not be a common occurrence.", "Pantene": "s response and product testing: The expert contacted Pantene directly and spoke with a customer care representative who stated that Pantene products were safe to use with salon services and that they had not received any reports of smoking foils. The representative also mentioned that Pantene products undergo thorough testing, which did not suggest any likelihood of such a reaction. However, they acknowledged that other salon products could potentially contribute to the reaction if it had occurred.", "Examination of Pantene product ingredients": "The original poster mentioned \"plastic and silicones\" as potential culprits in the incident. The expert examined the ingredients list of Pantene shampoos and did not find anything that directly indicated the presence of plastic or silicones that could cause a reaction leading to heating and smoking foils."}
