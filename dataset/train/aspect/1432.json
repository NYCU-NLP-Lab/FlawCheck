{"Comparison of claims": "The expert compared the claim made by the Democratic National Committee regarding the 55% increase in college tuition rates in Texas since 2003 with a news story from the Dallas Morning News in September 2012. This comparison helped verify the authenticity of the claim.", "Analysis of official data": "The expert obtained information from the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, which provided a publicly available report on Texas tuition and fees. The report stated that the statewide average total academic charges for a student taking 15 semester credit-hours at a public university had increased by 104% from fall 2003 through fall 2013. This official data supported the claim.", "Examination of specific institutions": "The expert analyzed charts in the board analysis that indicated the tuition and fees each year from fall 2003 through fall 2013 for nearly 40 institutions, primarily in the University of Texas or Texas A&M University systems. This examination of specific institutions provided additional evidence for the claim.", "Consideration of inflation": "Although the board's calculations did not take inflation into account, the expert employed information from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics to factor in inflation. This additional analysis helped provide a more comprehensive understanding of the claim and its authenticity."}
