{"Comparison to a previous similar policy": "The expert mentions the case of a Japanese amusement park that encouraged riders to \"please scream inside your heart\" as a measure to slow the spread of COVID-19. This comparison helps verify the claim about Disneyland enforcing a \"no scream\" policy on roller coasters.", "Lack of evidence from Disneyland": "The expert notes that Disneyland did not immediately respond to an email from PolitiFact about the post. This lack of response raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Inaccurate media reporting": "The expert highlights that other media organizations recently reported incorrectly that people riding roller coasters would be forbidden from screaming, but later corrected their information. This indicates that there may have been misinformation surrounding the claim.", "Responsible reopening plan": "The expert mentions the California Attractions and Parks Association's responsible reopening plan, which includes criteria for determining the risk of spreading COVID-19. While the plan suggests ways to limit the risks posed by shouting, it does not advocate for limiting screaming on roller coasters. This aspect further supports the notion that the claim may not be authentic."}
