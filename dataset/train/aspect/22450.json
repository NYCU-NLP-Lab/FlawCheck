{"The first aspect employed to verify the authenticity of the claim was the analysis of two sources": "Credit Suisse and Forbes. Credit Suisse estimated the distribution of household wealth worldwide, while Forbes provided a list of billionaires. These sources were used to gather data on global wealth distribution and assess the accuracy of the claim.", "Analysts hired by Credit Suisse estimated the total personal wealth at": "263 trillion and calculated that the bottom half of the world's population (approximately 3.5 billion people) owned less than 1 percent of all wealth. This information was crucial in determining the proportion of wealth owned by the richest 80 people compared to the bottom half of the global population.", "Other financial institutions": "such as the Allianz Group and the Boston Consulting Group, have also provided estimates of total household financial wealth that align closely with the figures reported by Credit Suisse. This additional verification from different sources adds credibility to the claim made by Sanders.", "One criticism of the Credit Suisse report was that it included individuals in wealthy countries who may have large debts": "resulting in misleading results. However, this criticism does not challenge the underlying numbers or the overall conclusion that the richest 80 people own more wealth than the bottom half of the global population. It merely raises a question about the interpretation of wealth and poverty."}
