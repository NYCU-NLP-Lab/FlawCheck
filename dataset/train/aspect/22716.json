{"The expert": "s verdict references The New York Times, which cites unnamed Defense Department officials stating that Vice President Mike Pence, not Trump, approved the deployment of the D.C. National Guard. It also mentions that Trump initially rebuffed and resisted requests to mobilize the National Guard, and the mobilization was initiated with the help of White House counsel Pat A. Cipollone and other officials. This aspect verifies that Trump's claim of personally deploying the National Guard is contradicted by officials and insiders involved in the process."}
