{"Refutation by Marine Corps spokesperson": "The Marine Corps spokesperson, Capt. Joseph Butterfield, explicitly stated that the claim is inaccurate and false. This refutation from an official representative of the Marine Corps adds credibility to the denial of the claim.", "Lack of evidence or credible sources": "The claim is based on an article from a far-right media outlet, Real Raw News, which may not be considered a reliable source of information. The lack of corroborating evidence or reports from other credible sources weakens the authenticity of the claim.", "Contradictory statements from the Joint Chiefs of Staff": "The memo sent by the joint chiefs of staff, including Gen. David H. Berger, emphasized their commitment to upholding the Constitution and supporting the inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden. The statement contradicts the claim that Gen. Berger refused Pelosi's request and reinforces the idea that the Marines will follow lawful orders from civilian authorities.", "Inconsistency with military protocol and hierarchy": "The claim suggests that Gen. Berger stated, \"We don't work for you!\" to Speaker Pelosi, implying a disregard for civilian authority. However, military protocol dictates that the President is the commander-in-chief, and the Marines ultimately take orders from the President, not individual politicians. This inconsistency raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim."}
