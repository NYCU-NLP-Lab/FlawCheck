Her account provided personal insight into the alleged affair and the circumstances surrounding Danney's birth.", "Clinton": "s response: The claim's authenticity was also evaluated based on Bill Clinton's response to the allegations. According to the information provided, Clinton laughed off the pregnancy claims and denied being the father of Danney Williams. This response, although not definitive proof, was considered as a factor in assessing the claim's authenticity.", "Paternity test results": "The claim's authenticity was further scrutinized through a paternity test.
