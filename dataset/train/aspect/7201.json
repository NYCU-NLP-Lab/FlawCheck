This aspect provides context about the legislative session in Rhode Island.", "Legislative session duration in Rhode Island": "The expert's verdict mentions that the Rhode Island General Assembly usually meets from January to June, with the House meeting a day or two more than the Senate. It also states that last year's session took 64 legislative days. This information verifies the current duration of the legislative session in Rhode Island.", "National Conference of State Legislatures": "The expert's verdict mentions that Kenneth Block referred to the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL) as his source for information on legislative sessions in other states. The NCSL is described as a bipartisan group that provides research and policy advice to state legislatures. This aspect verifies the credibility of Block's source and suggests that the NCSL's survey of the 50 states confirms the claim."}
