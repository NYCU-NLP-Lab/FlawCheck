{"Cost and operational duration": "The claim states that the Mickelsen Safeguard Complex cost $6 billion and was only operational for one day. The expert's verdict confirms that the complex cost around $5.7 billion and remained operational until February 10, 1976, which contradicts the claim.", "Purpose and design": "The claim suggests that the complex was created to deter missiles from the Russians. The expert's verdict confirms that the complex was part of a 12-part anti-ballistic missile defense system and was used as a bargaining chip with Russia during the Cold War. The complex's design, resembling a pyramid, is also mentioned in both the claim and the expert's verdict.", "Government expenditure and savings": "The claim questions the government's expenditure of $6 billion on a site that was operational for less than 24 hours. The expert's verdict provides an explanation, stating that the complex's early development was used to save billions by not building the other 11 bases. It also mentions that a significant portion of the cost was allocated to research and development.", "Conspiracy theories and association with the Illuminati": "The claim mentions theories that the complex could be a possible headquarters for the Illuminati due to its resemblance to a pyramid. While the expert's verdict does not directly address this theory, it acknowledges the complex's pyramid-like shape, which may indirectly contribute to the association made in the claim."}
