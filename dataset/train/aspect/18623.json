{"The claim originated from a widely": "shared Facebook post by a user named Alex Cruz, who posted several photographs of women with a thin layer of red substance on their faces. The post claimed that using menstrual blood as a face mask has incredible anti-aging effects.", "The images used in the Facebook post were compared to images of The Ordinary AHA 30": "BHA 2% peeling solution, a legitimate skincare product that produces a similar red appearance on the face. The comparison revealed that the photographs in Cruz's post were identical to the images of The Ordinary peeling solution.", "The expert mentions that the": "menstrual blood face mask\" claim is a clever hoax that plays off the sanguine appearance of The Ordinary peeling solution. This suggests that the authenticity of the claim was debunked based on the fact that it was a deliberate attempt to deceive readers.", "The expert also clarifies that the": "menstrual blood face mask\" hoax should not be confused with the legitimate beauty treatment known as the \"Vampire facial,\" which involves drawing blood from veins, separating out platelet-rich plasma, and injecting it into the face. This distinction further supports the debunking of the claim's authenticity."}
