{"Lack of supporting evidence": "The expert's verdict highlights that there is no support for the claim that travel restrictions on China saved hundreds of thousands of lives in the United States. This indicates a lack of empirical evidence or studies that back up the claim.", "Modest impact of travel restrictions": "The few studies conducted on travel restrictions regarding China suggest that while they may have slowed the initial spread outside of China, they did not effectively contain the coronavirus pandemic. The expert's verdict mentions that there is no study specifically focusing on the impact of U.S. restrictions alone.", "Limited effectiveness of international travel restrictions": "Past studies have shown that international travel restrictions can delay the spread of diseases but are not effective in containing them. The expert's verdict suggests that travel restrictions would need to be extremely strict, shutting down a significant percentage of all travel, to have a substantial impact.", "Expert opinion": "The expert, Saad B. Omer, director of the Yale Institute for Global Health, states that he has not seen any evidence supporting the president's claims. Omer explains that previous studies have shown that travel restrictions need to be very strict to have any effect, and even then, they only delay the spread rather than stopping it. This expert opinion further undermines the authenticity of the claim."}
