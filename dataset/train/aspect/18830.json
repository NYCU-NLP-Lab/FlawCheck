{"Disreputable sources": "The expert highlights that the claim originated from unreliable websites like Neon Nettle and Your News Wire, which are known for spreading junk news.", "Lack of evidence": "The expert points out that the alleged proof of the claim was based on a few small sections of someone else's facial features that vaguely resembled Barack Obama, providing no substantial evidence.", "Source of the photograph": "The expert reveals that the photograph was not leaked but publicly posted on Instagram by a user named @everysilversea, along with a caption indicating admiration for someone else. The fact that it was later deleted suggests potential harassment received by the user.", "Power of suggestion": "The expert emphasizes that it is challenging to identify a person based on a low-resolution photograph, especially when the person's face is mostly covered by a mask. However, some viewers quickly jumped to the conclusion that Obama was involved in Satanic worship based solely on this single image."}
