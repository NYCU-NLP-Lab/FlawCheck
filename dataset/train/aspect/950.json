{"Lack of evidence provided by the claimant": "The expert's verdict mentions that when asked to back up the claim, John Robitaille, the Republican candidate for governor, didn't offer much help and refused to provide additional proof or request a time-consuming manual search. This lack of evidence raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Inconsistent information from the claimant": "The expert's verdict mentions that John Robitaille insisted that there are many more former cook's helpers working within the registry but didn't provide any evidence to support this statement. This inconsistency in his statements further questions the credibility of the claim.", "Public records request": "The expert's verdict states that the publication filed its own public records request to verify the claim. The data received through this request revealed that there are only three former cook's helpers currently working at the DMV, none of whom are customer service representatives. This discrepancy between the claim and the actual data obtained casts doubt on the accuracy of the claim.", "Lack of confirmation from the Human Resources department": "The expert's verdict mentions that John Robitaille claimed that the Human Resources department couldn't confirm the presence of former cook's helpers without a time-consuming manual search. However, he refused to request such a search or provide additional proof. This lack of confirmation from the department adds to the skepticism surrounding the claim."}
