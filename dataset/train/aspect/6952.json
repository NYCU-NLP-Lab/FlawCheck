{"Visual inconsistencies in the video": "The expert points out that there are visual oddities in the video clip that suggest it has been digitally manipulated. The Pornhub logo appears to be floating unattached at a random point on the screen, which is unusual and raises doubts about its authenticity.", "Genuine clip from CNN": "The expert mentions that reporter Tancredi Palmeri was able to find the genuine clip from CNN. In this authentic clip, a Pornhub logo was not displayed on CNN's screen. This finding contradicts the claim made in the video and further supports the conclusion that it was manipulated.", "King": "s response: The expert includes a response from CNN reporter John King, who directly addresses the rumor. When asked if the clip was real, King dismisses it as false and attributes it to someone spreading misinformation. This response adds credibility to the conclusion that the claim is not authentic.", "Lack of plausible scenario": "The expert highlights that it is difficult to imagine a plausible scenario in which a Pornhub banner would be accidentally displayed on CNN's election board. They mention that while accidental sharing of computer screens with NSFW tabs has happened before, the way the Pornhub logo is shown in the video does not seem to be attached to any program. This observation further supports the argument that the claim is not genuine."}
