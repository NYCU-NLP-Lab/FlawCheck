{"Source": "The expert's verdict mentions that the source of the claim is a 2010 report from the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, which is an organization focused on fiscal issues. This source provides the basis for the claim of over $62 trillion in unfunded liabilities.", "Calculation and Components": "The expert's verdict explains that the $62 trillion figure is derived from the 2010 report's table titled \"Major Fiscal Exposure.\" It includes the sum of \"explicit liabilities,\" \"commitments and contingencies,\" and \"social insurance promises.\" The largest portion of this total is attributed to social insurance promises, specifically future Medicare benefits and social security benefits.", "Data and Reports": "The expert's verdict highlights that the projections used in the report come from the Social Security and Medicare Trustees reports dated Jan. 1, 2009. Additionally, the U.S. Treasury's 2009 report is mentioned as the source of the remaining data used in the calculations.", "Terminology": "The expert's verdict points out that there is an issue of terminology in the claim. The economist J.D. Foster states that the term \"unfunded liabilities\" used by Rep. Frank R. Wolf is technically incorrect when referring to the shortfalls in Social Security and Medicare. This aspect highlights the need for precise terminology and understanding of the terms used in the claim."}
