{"The claim made in the campaign mailer states that Steve Santarsiero wrote PA": "s Gun Safety Law, implying that he was directly responsible for the creation of a comprehensive gun safety law in Pennsylvania.", "The expert": "s analysis further revealed that Pennsylvania's gun safety regulations were established by state legislators for decades prior to Santarsiero's election. This aspect highlights the fact that Santarsiero cannot solely be credited with the creation of gun safety laws in the state.", "The expert also found that while Santarsiero had introduced bills related to gun safety": "such as a background check bill and a bill prohibiting the sale of firearms to individuals on the federal terrorist watch list, these bills were never passed into law. This aspect emphasizes that Santarsiero's proposed legislation did not become law, despite his claims in the campaign mailer."}
