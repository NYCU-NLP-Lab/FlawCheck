{"The claim is based on a series of peer": "reviewed studies published in a new book by Dr. Shanna Swan, an epidemiologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. This indicates that the claim is supported by scientific research and adds credibility to the authenticity of the claim.", "The studies found that sperm concentration among men from Western countries had halved from 1973 to 2011": "with no evidence of \"leveling off\" in recent years. This specific data provides quantitative evidence to support the claim about decreasing sperm counts.", "The studies also showed that penis sizes in biological males who had been exposed to a plastic chemical called phthalates were shrinking": "This indicates a potential link between chemical exposure and changes in reproductive development, further supporting the claim.", "The claim acknowledges that sperm levels in biological males from Asia": "South America, and Africa were not shown to be drastically decreasing. This highlights the need for further investigation to determine if lifestyle, chemical exposures, or other factors play a role in the observed trends, indicating a balanced and cautious approach to the claim."}
