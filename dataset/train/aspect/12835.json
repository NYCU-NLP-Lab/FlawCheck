{"Multiple requests for verification": "The expert mentions that Alt News has received multiple requests on its helpline number to verify the video, indicating that there is a significant public interest in the authenticity of the claim.", "Previous debunking of similar videos": "The expert highlights that Alt News had previously debunked a similar video that went viral with a claim of a school teacher in Gujarat brutally thrashing children. This suggests that there is a history of false attribution of such videos to different schools, including DPS Rajbagh.", "Identification of the person in the video": "The expert mentions that the then Meghalaya Governor Tathagata Roy had identified the person in the video as 'Sakil Ahmed Ansari', a teacher of DPS Rajbagh School. This identification adds credibility to the claim that the video is related to DPS Rajbagh.", "Verification through external sources": "The expert refers to articles published by Daily Mail and BBC that provide details about a similar video from Egypt, where an orphanage manager named Osama Mohammed Othman was secretly filmed brutally beating children. This external verification helps establish that the video in question is not related to DPS Rajbagh or India, but rather a separate incident in Egypt."}
