{"The claim states that": "the next president could revoke such an executive agreement with the stroke of a pen and future Congresses could modify the terms of the agreement at any time.\" This aspect of the claim suggests that the power to revoke or modify the agreement lies with the president and Congress.", "The expert": "s verdict mentions the State Department's response, with spokesperson Jen Psaki stating that Congress does not have the power to modify the terms of international arrangements negotiated by the executive. This aspect supports the argument that the claim's assertion about Congress's ability to modify the agreement is incorrect."}
