{"Investigation into state welfare program": "The experts likely examined the state welfare program to determine if there are any provisions or regulations that allow or restrict the withdrawal of funds from strip clubs, casinos, and liquor stores. They would have looked for any official documentation or policies regarding the use of benefit transfer cards and the types of establishments where funds can be withdrawn.", "Analysis of benefit transfer card usage": "The experts would have analyzed data or conducted research on how welfare recipients use their benefit transfer cards. They would have looked for patterns or trends in the types of establishments where funds are commonly withdrawn, including strip clubs, casinos, and liquor stores. This analysis would help determine if there is any evidence to support the claim that funds are being withdrawn from these specific establishments.", "Examination of legislative records": "The experts would have reviewed legislative records, such as voting records or statements made by Rep. Betty Sutton, to determine her stance on the issue of allowing welfare fund withdrawals from strip clubs, casinos, and liquor stores. They would have looked for any evidence of her support or opposition to such withdrawals and whether she has taken any actions or made any statements related to this claim.", "Verification of source credibility": "The experts would have assessed the credibility of the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) as the source of the claim. They would have examined the NRCC's track record for accuracy and truthfulness in their statements and news releases. This assessment would help determine the reliability of the claim and the likelihood of it being accurate."}
