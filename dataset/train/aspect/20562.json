{"The meme claims that Rep": "Nancy Pelosi, Rep. Maxine Waters, and Sen. Bernie Sanders had \"6 bills passed\" over \"67 combined years.\" The expert's analysis confirms that this number is incorrect and misleading.", "The expert refers to data from GovTrack": "us, a website that tracks the status of legislation and profiles members of Congress. According to GovTrack, Pelosi, Waters, and Sanders have sponsored and co-sponsored a significant number of bills that became law, contradicting the meme's claim.", "The expert highlights that measuring lawmakers": "effectiveness solely based on the number of bills enacted is not an informative argument. They explain that the majority of bills introduced do not get signed into law, and therefore, using this metric alone does not accurately reflect a lawmaker's effectiveness.", "The expert mentions the Center for Effective Lawmaking": "which has developed an online tool using Library of Congress data to gauge lawmakers' effectiveness. This tool assigns an effectiveness \"score\" to each member of Congress, taking into account various factors beyond just the number of bills passed."}
