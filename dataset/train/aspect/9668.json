{"Testimony from a reliable source": "The expert's verdict includes the testimony of Nelson M. Rosario, who shared remarks attributed to his father, a resident of Puerto Rico. This firsthand account adds credibility to the claim.", "Corroboration with official reports": "The expert mentions that the official death toll in Puerto Rico was expected to increase dramatically, which aligns with the claim that all patients in the intensive care unit of a hospital were killed by Hurricane Maria. This correlation with official reports strengthens the authenticity of the claim.", "Criticism and concerns from public figures": "The expert includes statements from Sen. Elizabeth Warren and San Juan Mayor Carmen Yul\u00edn Cruz, both expressing concerns about the accuracy of the death toll. Their criticism and calls for accurate counting suggest that there may be validity to the claim.", "Alternative estimates and statements": "The expert mentions an estimate by Mayor Cruz that the death toll was \"probably\" closer to 500 people, which contrasts with the official count of 51 deaths at the time. These alternative estimates and statements indicate a discrepancy in the reported numbers and raise questions about the authenticity of the claim."}
