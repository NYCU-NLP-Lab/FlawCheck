{"Surveillance recording": "The Maricopa County Elections Department has a surveillance recording of a man rummaging through a dumpster outside their office and attempting to gain entry into their warehouse. This recording provides evidence that someone was searching through the dumpster, but does not prove the claim of shredded ballots.", "Ballots stored in locked indoor vault": "The department states that all voted ballots from the 2020 election are sealed in a locked indoor vault, awaiting shipment for an audit by the state Senate. This contradicts the claim that shredded ballots were found in the dumpster, as the department affirms that none are kept in the warehouse and none have been shredded.", "Lack of reliable evidence": "The expert's verdict mentions that the lawsuit filed by Staci Burk, who posted the photos of shredded paper on Facebook, alleging widespread fraud in the 2020 election, was dismissed by a judge. The judge found the suit to be lacking relevant or reliable evidence, indicating that the claim of shredded ballots may not be substantiated.", "Inconsistencies and questionable source": "The article and photos were published by The Gateway Pundit, a conservative website. The expert's verdict points out that the article was flagged by Facebook for false news and misinformation. Additionally, the unidentified man in the photos was accompanied by Staci Burk, who had previously filed a dismissed lawsuit alleging fraud. These inconsistencies and the questionable source raise doubts about the authenticity of the claim."}
