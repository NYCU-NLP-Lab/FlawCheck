{"Ronald Reagan signed the Firearm Owners Protection Act in 1986": "which provided protections for gun owners but also barred the private sale and ownership of fully automatic rifles that were not already registered with the federal government on the day Reagan signed the law.", "Private citizens are still able to buy and transfer machine guns that were registered prior to May 20": "1986, as long as they pass a background check, receive signed approval from their local police chief or sheriff, and pay a $200 federal tax.", "Reagan supported a ban on assault weapons and signed a letter in 1994": "along with former Presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter, urging members of the U.S. House of Representatives to support a pending bill banning assault weapons. The measure cleared Congress and was signed by President Bill Clinton, but the ban expired in 2004 when Congress chose not to extend it.", "Del": "Alfonso Lopez's claim that Reagan \"banned ownership of fully automatic rifles\" is not entirely accurate, as Reagan's law did not ban the old machine guns but rather stopped new ones from entering the private marketplace. However, Lopez's claim that Reagan supported the assault weapons ban is true."}
