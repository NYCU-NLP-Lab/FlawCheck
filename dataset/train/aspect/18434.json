{"John Podesta": "s denial of involvement with the DNC: Podesta stated in an op-ed for the Washington Post that he had nothing to do with the Democratic National Committee and never chaired it, therefore there was no DNC server for him to refuse to give.", "DNC spokesperson": "s confirmation: According to DNC spokesperson Adrienne Watson, Podesta never had any involvement in the DNC's handling of their email server and did not deny handing over a DNC server to intelligence agencies.", "Podesta": "s victimization by Russian hackers: Podesta was a victim of the same phishing trick as the DNC, which was linked to the Russian government by the U.S. Intelligence Community. This suggests that Podesta's emails were compromised by Russian-directed efforts.", "Lack of FBI access to DNC server": "In a tweet, Trump questioned whether the DNC allowed the FBI access to their server after it was hacked. In his testimony, former FBI Director James Comey stated that the agency never got access to the machines themselves but obtained access to the forensics from a review performed by CrowdStrike. This indicates that the FBI did not directly examine the DNC server."}
