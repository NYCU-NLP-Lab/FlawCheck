{"The requirement of serving a minimum number of years to qualify for the pension": "The expert mentions that a legislator needs to serve eight years to qualify for the pension if they retire at age 60, or 10 years if they retire at age 50. This requirement is supported by information from the Employees Retirement System of Texas.", "Calculation of pension amount based on years of service": "The expert states that for each year of service, a legislator qualifies for a pension equal to 2.3 percent of the judicial salary, which has been $125,000 since 2005. This information is sourced from an Austin American-Statesman column.", "Percentage of legislators receiving pension benefits": "The expert claims that less than half of 1 percent of House and Texas Senate members ever receive a pension benefit. This interpretation is confirmed by the expert's conversation with State Rep. Doug Miller and is supported by data provided by Miller's office, which states that 63 out of 181 current members of the House and Senate, or 35 percent, will have served 10 years or more through 2013.", "The historical context and legislative changes": "The expert mentions that lawmakers tied legislator pensions to the salary of a state district judge in 1975, which increased the long-term rewards. The expert also mentions a previous law from 1969 that allowed legislators to contribute to the retirement system, potentially qualifying them for pensions tied to their own salaries."}
