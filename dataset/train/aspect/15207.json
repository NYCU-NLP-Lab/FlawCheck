{"The claim states that the health care law imposes a federal mandate requiring middle": "class Americans to buy health insurance \"whether they can afford it or not.\" The expert's verdict clarifies that the mandate is actually a tax penalty assessed on people's income tax returns, and it only applies to those who remain uninsured. This aspect verifies that the claim misrepresents the nature of the mandate.", "The expert": "s verdict also mentions that exceptions exist for individuals who cannot afford insurance. If the cost of a health insurance policy exceeds 8 percent of their earnings (excluding employer contributions or tax credits), they qualify for a hardship exemption. Additionally, individuals who do not make enough money to file a federal tax return are exempt from the mandate. This aspect verifies that the law includes exemptions for those who genuinely cannot afford insurance."}
