{"The claim is supported by a Justice Department report on homicide trends from 1980 to 2008": "which found that 84% of white homicide victims over that period were killed by other white people, and 93% of Black victims were killed by other Black people.", "The claim aligns with the widely accepted understanding in criminology and police circles that most homicides are intraracial": "meaning they involve people of the same race.", "More recent FBI homicide data from 2018 also supports the claim": "with approximately 81% of white victims being killed by white people, and about 89% of Black victims being killed by Black people.", "The claim highlights the discrepancy in language usage": "where the term \"white-on-white crime\" is rarely used, while \"Black-on-Black crime\" is frequently mentioned, raising questions about the racial bias in media and public discourse."}
