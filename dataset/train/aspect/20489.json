{"Lack of corroborating evidence": "The expert's verdict highlights that the claim of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford making a sexual assault accusation against Justice Neil Gorsuch during his Supreme Court nomination process lacks any corroborating evidence. This indicates that there is no supporting information or proof to substantiate the claim.", "Origin of the claim": "The claim originated solely from two tweets by Josh Cornett, who describes himself as \"proudly blocked\" by several journalists and political Twitter accounts. This suggests that the claim was not based on credible sources or verified information.", "Previous inaccurate statements by the source": "The expert's verdict mentions that Josh Cornett's Twitter account has previously promoted conspiracy theories such as Pizzagate and #QAnon. This raises doubts about the credibility and reliability of the source, indicating a history of spreading false information.", "Inaccurate portrayal of liberal women": "The expert's verdict also highlights that Josh Cornett has made derogatory and biased statements about liberal women, including Kavanaugh accusers. This further questions the credibility and impartiality of the source, suggesting a potential bias in spreading misinformation."}
