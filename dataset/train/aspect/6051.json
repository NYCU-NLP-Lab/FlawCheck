{"Contradictory statements from Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad": "The expert's verdict highlights the contradiction between CNN News18's claim and the statements made by the Malaysian Prime Minister in an interview with TRT. The Prime Minister stated that Malaysia cannot have Zakir Naik due to his extreme views but also mentioned that it is difficult to send him to other countries.", "Lack of reporting by other news outlets": "The expert's verdict points out that no other Indian or Malaysian news outlet had reported the supposed development of Malaysia refusing asylum to Zakir Naik. This raises doubts about the authenticity of CNN News18's exclusive report.", "Denials by local Malaysian press": "The expert's verdict mentions that local Malaysian press, including FMT News, reported that the government had not refused asylum to Zakir Naik. Quoting government sources, they denied the news report from India and stated that the controversial preacher was not asked to leave Malaysia.", "Refutation by Malaysian Home Ministry": "A news report by Aaj Tak quoted the Malaysian Home Ministry refuting the claims about Malaysia extraditing Zakir Naik. This further undermines the credibility of CNN News18's claim."}
