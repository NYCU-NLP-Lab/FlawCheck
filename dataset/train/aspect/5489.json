{"The administration has proposed rules to expand the sale of less expensive insurance with fewer benefits": "but no such cheap plans have been released yet.", "The proposed changes could increase the price of coverage for those who remain on the individual market and ACA exchanges": "3. The Department of Labor issued proposed regulations on association health plans, and several agencies released proposed regulations on short-term plans.", "The new health care plans": "if implemented, would likely be cheaper because they wouldn't be required to cover certain benefits and could vary pricing based on personal factors such as age and gender more widely than the ACA permits. Short-term plans could also price premiums or deny coverage based on health status."}
