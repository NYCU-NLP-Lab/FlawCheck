{"Multiple fake news articles": "The expert's verdict highlights that the claim was supported by a series of fake news articles that were all fabricated. These articles can be traced back to one website, TheLastLineOfDefense.org, which is known for publishing satirical content.", "Fabricated quotes and fake story": "The articles included a fake quote attributed to Snoop Dogg, in which he allegedly said that he hoped someone would shoot President Trump if he started a war. The fake story also claimed that a fake reporter informed the Secret Service about Snoop's statement, resulting in his arrest. The expert's verdict confirms that these quotes and the story were entirely fabricated.", "Lack of evidence and consistency": "The expert's verdict mentions that the posts claiming Snoop Dogg's arrest were flagged by Facebook users as potentially fake. The articles themselves lacked evidence to support the claim, and most of them appeared to copy each other. This lack of originality and consistency raised doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Snoop Dogg": "s actual stance: The expert's verdict clarifies that while Snoop Dogg is not a fan of President Trump and has criticized him in the past, he did not express any desire for someone to shoot Trump. The video for his song \"Lavender\" may depict controversial imagery, but it does not involve any call for violence against the president. This aspect further discredits the claim's authenticity."}
