{"The claim that Bill White spent his city billions of dollars into debt was based on a memo distributed by a group that included a retired CPA": "The memo stated that the city was broke as a result of overspending and the national recession, and raised the possibility of imminent bankruptcy.", "The city": "s director of finance and former director countered this claim, stating that the city is not broke and that there is no potential for bankruptcy. They provided evidence that the city's assets exceeded liabilities by $1.7 billion and that the general fund balances increased during White's tenure as mayor.", "While the city": "s debt load did increase during White's time as mayor, the increase was $2.9 billion, or 29 percent. This includes debt payable from property taxes, which increased by 65 percent.", "It was also verified that Houston": "s crime rates did drop to the lowest levels in 25 years during White's tenure as mayor, reaching a 29-year low in 2008. However, there was an uptick in violent crime in 2005, which was attributed to the influx of people fleeing to the Houston area after Hurricane Katrina."}
