{"Historical accounts and documentation": "The expert mentions the historical significance of the black lawn jockey figures in the context of the Underground Railroad. They refer to Charles Blockson, a historian and curator, who believes that these statues were used as markers on the Underground Railroad. This suggests that there may be historical records or accounts supporting this claim.", "Symbolic coding": "The expert explains that the clothing of the statue was coded to convey different messages to escaping slaves. For example, a striped jockey's shirt indicated a place to swap horses, a footman in a tailed coat meant overnight lodgings or food, and a blue sailor's waistcoat indicated that the homeowner could help the slaves reach a port and board a ship to Canada. This aspect suggests that there was a deliberate system of symbols associated with the statues.", "Regional distribution": "The expert mentions that these statues were primarily found in the northern states and became more common in the South after World War II when northerners moved there. This regional distribution could indicate a correlation between the presence of these statues and the Underground Railroad, as the Underground Railroad operated primarily in the northern states.", "Support from African": "American community: The expert refers to Charles Blockson, who is an African-American historian and curator, and his belief that the lawn jockey statues were actually a positive and supportive figure for African-Americans. This aspect suggests that there may be support and validation for the claim from within the African-American community."}
