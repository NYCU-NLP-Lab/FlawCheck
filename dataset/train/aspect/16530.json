{"Sanctuary policies do not mean that undocumented criminals are released without charges or that local officials order police to release them as standard operating procedure": "These policies protect noncitizens from being turned over to ICE after they have gone through the justice system.", "Many sanctuary policies have provisions that allow police to cooperate with ICE for noncitizens with previous felony convictions": "This means that dangerous criminals with serious criminal records can still be handed over to ICE for removal.", "Media reports and ICE have documented cases where noncitizens with serious criminal records were released by sanctuary cities despite detainer requests": "This suggests that there have been instances where dangerous criminals were released instead of being handed over to ICE.", "During the 2020 State of the Union address": "President Donald Trump criticized sanctuary cities for their limited cooperation with ICE. While there is no federal definition for a sanctuary city and the details vary, Trump's claim that local officials \"order police to release dangerous criminal aliens\" is not entirely accurate, as even sanctuary cities often turn over felons to ICE."}
