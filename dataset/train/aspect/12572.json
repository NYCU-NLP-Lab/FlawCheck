{"The claim is based on a correlation between the FBI death stats and the Democratic politics of the cities": "However, the expert points out that correlation does not imply causation, suggesting that the claim lacks a strong causal link.", "The expert highlights that violence in cities is often concentrated in specific areas and perpetrated by a small percentage of the population": "Therefore, connecting the overall politics of a city to its violence levels is considered a stretch.", "The accuracy of labeling cities as the": "deadliest\" is questioned by the expert. The FBI's Uniform Crime Report, which the claim references, only provides rough rankings and does not consider the numerous variables that influence crime rates in a specific locality.", "The claim assumes that the Democratic majority in these cities is responsible for the violence": "but the expert points out that comparing voting data from larger metropolitan areas (which may include Republican-leaning surrounding counties) to crime data within city limits is not a reasonable approach."}
