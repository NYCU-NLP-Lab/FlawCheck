{"Lack of evidence": "The expert's verdict highlights that there is no evidence to support the claim that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi tried to take 93 family members on a canceled overseas trip. This lack of evidence undermines the authenticity of the claim.", "Source credibility": "The claim originates from The Marshall Report, a website known for peddling fake news. The expert's verdict emphasizes that this source has a history of spreading misinformation, further questioning the authenticity of the claim.", "Contradictory statements": "Pelosi's deputy chief of staff, Drew Hammill, denies the claim by stating that no spouses were on the postponed trip. While he does not comment on other family members, his denial adds doubt to the claim's authenticity.", "Confirmed details of the trip": "Credible news outlets reported that the trip consisted of seven lawmakers and top staffers, not their families. The expert's verdict mentions that these lawmakers, including Pelosi, were headed to Brussels to meet with NATO allies and military leaders, and then to Afghanistan to visit U.S. troops. This confirmed information contradicts the claim about 93 family members being included in the trip."}
