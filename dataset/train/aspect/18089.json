{"Lack of reliable historical evidence": "The expert's verdict highlights the absence of any concrete evidence or documentation to support the claim that Theophilus Van Kannel developed the revolving door due to an aversion to holding open doors for women. This lack of evidence raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Inconsistent and unreliable sources": "The expert points out that the earliest version of the story can be traced back to a blog post that contains a disclaimer about containing untruths. Additionally, the only source cited, an essay by an MIT professor, does not mention Van Kannel's alleged misogyny. This inconsistency in sources further undermines the credibility of the claim.", "Alternative explanations": "The expert presents alternative explanations for the invention of the revolving door, such as Van Kannel's dislike of social phobia and his desire to avoid the awkwardness of deciding who should enter or exit a building first. These alternative explanations suggest that the claim of misogyny may not be the true motivation behind the invention.", "Contradictory information": "The expert also mentions contradictory information, such as the claim that Van Kannel was a man without a family. This information, coupled with the lack of evidence, raises doubts about the claim's authenticity and suggests that it may be based on speculation rather than factual information."}
