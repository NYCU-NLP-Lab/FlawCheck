{"The claim is based on a lawsuit filed by the Public Interest Legal Foundation": "PILF), a conservative organization that regularly brings voting-related lawsuits against states.", "The lawsuit alleged that more than 21": "000 voters registered in Pennsylvania were dead and requested the court to order the state to remove them from the rolls before the election.", "The judge": "John Jones III, cited PILF's questionable methodology in developing its list of ineligible voters and its decision to file the suit close to the election as factors that undermined the claim's authenticity.", "Pennsylvania": "s system for removing deceased voters from the rolls appears to be effective, as the state law requires the health department to notify election officials of deaths, and the officials are responsible for canceling corresponding voter registrations. The secretary of the commonwealth maintains a database where these voter records are updated, and thousands of deceased voters are regularly removed from the database each year."}
