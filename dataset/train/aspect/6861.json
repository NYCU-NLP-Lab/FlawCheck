{"The claim is based on the statement made by Jim Renacci": "the GOP candidate for John Boccieri's seat, who repeatedly stated that Boccieri votes with Nancy Pelosi 94 percent of the time. This statement is presented as the primary evidence for the claim.", "The National Republican Congressional Committee": "NRCC) labels Boccieri as one of \"Pelosi's Puppets\" on its website and attacks his voting record in a television ad. The ad claims that Boccieri voted with Nancy Pelosi 93 percent of the time, and it features pictures of both legislators. This ad serves as additional evidence supporting the claim.", "The NRCC cites a Washington Post voting database to back up its contention that Boccieri frequently votes with Pelosi": "However, Boccieri dismisses these claims as dishonest, arguing that House speakers seldom vote. The Washington Post database shows that Pelosi has voted only 94 times in the past two years, while Boccieri has cast 1,550 votes. This discrepancy raises questions about the accuracy of using the database to determine Boccieri's alignment with Pelosi.", "The Washington Post clarifies that its voting database represents": "the percentage of votes on which a lawmaker agrees with the position taken by a majority of his or her party members,\" rather than the frequency with which they vote with a particular party leader. It states that Boccieri voted with his party 94 percent of the time over the past two years, with the average party loyalty for all members listed at 90.6 percent. This information challenges the interpretation that Boccieri's voting alignment is directly correlated with Pelosi's leadership."}
