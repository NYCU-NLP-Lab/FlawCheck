{"The expert": "s verdict mentions that the claim made by Moorlach about crime getting worse under Jerry Brown was based on a report by The Bee, stating that three-quarters of California's largest cities saw a rise in violent crime in 2015, with Sacramento's crime rate increasing by 25 percent.", "The expert also mentions that similar claims about increasing crime rates have been made by other California lawmakers": "such as State Sen. Jeff Stone and Assemblyman Travis Allen. This suggests that the claim made by Moorlach is not an isolated statement but part of a larger narrative.", "The expert refers to data from the nonpartisan Legislative Analyst": "s Office, which shows that the overall crime rate in California declined by about 60 percent between 1980 and 2015. This data contradicts Moorlach's claim and raises doubts about its accuracy.", "The expert highlights the cautionary remarks of Jonathan Peterson from the California Legislative Analyst": "s Office, who states that year-over-year changes in crime rates can create the illusion of rapid growth or decline. Peterson emphasizes that the past six to seven years have been marked by fluctuations in California's crime rate, rather than a consistent increase or decrease. This suggests that the claim made by Moorlach may not provide a comprehensive or accurate picture of the crime situation in California."}
