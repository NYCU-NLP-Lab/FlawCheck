{"The claim is based on a screenshot of an article posted on Instagram on November 9": "2020, which states that Kamala Harris proposes keeping schools open until 6 p.m. This screenshot received over 55,000 likes.", "The Family Friendly School Act": "introduced by Kamala Harris in November 2019, aimed to extend school hours for 500 selected schools from at least 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. The goal was to align school hours with parents' work schedules and support working families. The legislation would also provide grants of up to $5 million for academic, athletic, or enrichment opportunities for schools serving low-income families.", "The Department of Education would be required to publish and disseminate a report on lessons learned at the end of the five": "year grant period. However, the bill would not require teachers to work additional hours, although they could choose to do so and be compensated fairly.", "The claim has not seen any advancements since it was introduced in 2019": "and the Biden-Harris education plan does not mention extending school hours. Instead, their plan focuses on tripling the amount of money low-income schools receive, providing teachers with a raise, and prioritizing mental health care in schools."}
