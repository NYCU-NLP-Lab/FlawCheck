{"The expert": "s verdict also mentions that Perry's \"only one individual\" conclusion overlooks Sen. Lindsey Graham, who served as an Air Force lawyer and is mentioned in his Senate biographical entry. This aspect questions the accuracy of Perry's claim and suggests that there may be other candidates with military experience that he failed to acknowledge.", "Perry": "s biographical entry on his website states that he served in the U.S. Air Force from 1972 to 1977, flying C-130 tactical airlift aircraft in Europe and the Middle East. This information supports the claim of his military service.", "The Washington Post reported in 2011 that when Perry ran for president in 2012": "he was nearly the only candidate with a military record. The only other candidate with military experience mentioned was Rep. Ron Paul. This information reinforces the claim that Perry is unique among the presidential candidates in terms of military service."}
