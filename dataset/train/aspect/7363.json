{"The claim states that Joe Biden owns the largest mansion in his state": "2. The expert's investigation found that Biden owns two properties in Delaware, a primary residence in Wilmington and a vacation house in Rehoboth Beach, but neither of these properties can be considered the \"biggest mansion\" in the state.", "The Winterthur Estate": "a 175-room mansion sitting on 2,500 acres, could be considered Delaware's largest mansion, but it has been turned into a museum and may not be applicable to the claim.", "The Nemours Mansion": "with 47,000 sq. ft., is larger than Biden's properties, but it also no longer serves as a single-family residence and may not be a valid comparison."}
