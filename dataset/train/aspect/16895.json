{"Multiple sources": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim has been circulated online for a few years and has been attributed to various individuals, including BJP IT cell head Amit Malviya, national BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra, Dalit scholar Kancha Ilaiah Shepherd, and a retired bureaucrat named V Sundaram. This indicates that the claim has been discussed and attributed to Nehru by multiple sources.", "Social media variations": "The expert's verdict states that there are several versions of the quote shared on social media, with subtle variations. This suggests that the claim has been widely circulated and discussed on social media platforms, further reinforcing its authenticity.", "References in books": "The expert's verdict mentions two books, \"The Nehrus: Motilal and Jawaharlal\" by B R Nanda and \"Motilal Nehru,\" where the quote is referred to. These books attribute the quote to N B Khare, a leader of the Hindu Mahasabha, who described Nehru as 'English by education, Muslim by culture and Hindu by an accident of birth.' The inclusion of these references from reputable books adds credibility to the claim.", "Corroboration by other sources": "The expert's verdict also mentions that Congress MP Shashi Tharoor alludes to this quotation in his book \"Nehru: The Invention of India,\" once again quoting N B Khare. This corroborates the claim and provides additional evidence of its authenticity."}
