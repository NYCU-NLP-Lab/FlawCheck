{"The misleading image was published on Twitter on November 6": "2019, the same day as the attack on Junius Ho, as reported by AFP. This establishes the timing of the claim and its connection to the incident.", "The tweet": "s caption translated from traditional Chinese to English states that netizens found the weapon used in the attack to be an \"antistatic comb\" from Taobao. This provides information about the alleged weapon and its source.", "The composite image in the tweet consists of two separate images": "On the right is a photograph of the knife allegedly used in the attack, which has been published in local Hong Kong media reports. On the left is an image that appears to show the same implement being advertised on a product page on Taobao, with keywords for comb visible. This highlights the visual evidence presented to support the claim.", "The authenticity of the claim is refuted by evidence that the Taobao image was doctored from a screenshot of an actual Taobao page selling combs": "A comparison between the misleading Taobao image and the actual product page shows identical keywords and traces of the same background, indicating manipulation. This demonstrates the false nature of the claim."}
