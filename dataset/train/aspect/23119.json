{"Lack of historical data": "The expert pointed out that there are no known numbers for farmer suicides going back to the 1930s, which makes it difficult to verify the claim about farmer suicide rates being as high as during the Great Depression.", "Limited scope of the study": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) study mentioned by the expert only covered 17 states and did not include major farming states such as Kansas, Iowa, Nebraska, North and South Dakota, and California. This limited scope raises concerns about the representativeness of the data and its applicability to the claim.", "Small sample size": "The CDC study reported low numbers of suicides among farmers, with 59 incidents in one year and 54 in another. The expert cautioned that with such small numbers, even a few incidents can significantly impact the suicide rates, making it difficult to draw definitive conclusions.", "Underreporting and exclusion of part": "time farmers: The director of the Center for Agricultural Safety and Health at the University of Iowa highlighted that part-time farmers are often left out of the farmer statistics, and their deaths are not included in the tallies. This underreporting and exclusion of a significant portion of the farming population may lead to an inaccurate representation of the actual suicide rates among farmers."}
