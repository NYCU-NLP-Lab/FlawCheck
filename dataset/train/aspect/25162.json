{"Lack of official documentation": "The expert notes that the claim does not appear in any of President Kennedy's transcribed speeches, press conferences, books by or about him, or academic or popular histories of the period. This absence of official documentation raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Origin of the claim": "The earliest example of the claim found by the expert dates back to 2004, in a message board post with slightly different wording. The fact that the claim emerged relatively recently and cannot be traced back to any official sources or credible historical records casts further doubt on its authenticity.", "Inconsistencies in wording": "The expert highlights the variations in wording between different versions of the claim. While the essence remains the same, slight differences in phrasing suggest that the claim may have been altered or misattributed over time, further undermining its credibility.", "Contextual analysis": "The expert examines two speeches given by President Kennedy seven days before his assassination, searching for any mention of a conspiracy to enslave every man, woman, and child. However, neither speech contains such a statement, reducing the likelihood that the claim is authentic."}
