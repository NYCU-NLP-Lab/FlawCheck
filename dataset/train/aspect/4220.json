{"Misleading editing": "The expert's verdict highlights that the Trump campaign ad misleadingly edits a CNN interview to suggest that Dr. Sanjay Gupta agrees that 2 million people would have died from the novel coronavirus were it not for President Trump's China travel restrictions. The ad selectively edits Wolf Blitzer's question to create a false impression.", "Context of the question": "The ad edited Blitzer's question in a misleading way. The original question was about the impact of social distancing measures and stay-at-home orders, not specifically about travel restrictions. The ad fails to provide this context, leading to a distorted interpretation of Dr. Gupta's response.", "Nuanced response": "Dr. Gupta's response to Blitzer's question was more nuanced than the ad suggests. While he acknowledged the potential severity of the virus and its ability to cause disease and death, he also emphasized that the numbers were based on models and not definitive predictions. The ad simplifies his response, making it appear as a direct endorsement of Trump's travel restrictions.", "WarnerMedia": "s objection: WarnerMedia, the parent company of CNN, sent a letter to the Trump campaign, asking them to stop airing the ad. The letter stated that the ad purposely and deceptively edited the clip to imply that Blitzer and Gupta were crediting Trump's travel ban policy for saving lives, while they were actually discussing social distancing guidelines and stay-at-home orders. This objection from WarnerMedia further supports the conclusion that the ad is misleading and deceptive."}
