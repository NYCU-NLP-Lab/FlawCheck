{"The claim was supported by a statistic mentioned in Aziz Ansari": "s book \"Modern Romance\" that stated \"46 percent of women between the age of 16 to 24 despise sexual contact.\" This statistic was also cited in other sources such as the Guardian and Slate, indicating that it had been reported before.", "The statistic was based on a survey conducted by the Japan Family Planning Association": "which has been conducting this survey every two years since 2002. The survey was sent to 3,000 people between the ages of 16 and 49, and approximately 1,300 people responded in 2012.", "The authenticity of the claim was verified by Kumiko Endo": "a Japanese-American academic who helped Ansari and his coauthor navigate the complex story of Japan's changing relationship norms. As a 34-year-old single woman born and raised in Japan, Endo provided insights into the cultural context and confirmed the credibility of the survey conducted by the Japan Family Planning Association.", "The claim was further supported by the fact that Japan is currently facing a crisis of falling marriage rates and birthrates": "which has led the government to intervene by offering subsidies for parents with kids and organizing state-funded dating events. This context adds credibility to the claim that there is a significant disinterest in sex among young people in Japan."}
