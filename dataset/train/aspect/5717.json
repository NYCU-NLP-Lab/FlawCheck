{"The first aspect employed to verify the authenticity of the claim is the analysis of data from the U": "S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). The EIA collects data on energy and provides information on oil imports and exports between countries.", "The second aspect is the examination of Libya": "s oil exports and its major customers. The EIA data shows that Italy is the largest customer of Libyan oil, followed by France and China. This information contradicts Trump's statement that Libya supplies all its oil to China.", "The third aspect is the analysis of China": "s oil imports and its major suppliers. The data reveals that China's largest oil supplier is Saudi Arabia, followed by Angola and Iran. Libya ranks ninth in China's list of oil suppliers, indicating that it is not the chief supplier as claimed by Trump.", "The fourth aspect is the comparison of the United States": "oil imports from Libya. The data shows that the United States imported only a small percentage of its oil from Libya in 2010, indicating that Trump's statement of getting no oil from Libya is largely accurate."}
