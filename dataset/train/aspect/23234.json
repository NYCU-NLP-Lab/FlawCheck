{"The claim was based on an article published by NetLiveMedia": "which reported the discovery of a \"mysterious 4-meter long sea monster\" that washed ashore in Mexico in June 2016.", "The photograph of the sea creature found on Bonfil Beach in Acapulco": "Mexico, resembled the \"Montauk Monster\" from 2008, including distinctive facial features and creases in the flesh.", "The primary image used in the digital manipulation of the photograph was previously used in several marine anomaly hoaxes": "suggesting a lack of authenticity.", "Another image associated with the claim originated from a beaching in Mexico in March 2016": "initially thought to be an unidentified animal carcass but later identified as the decomposed head of a sperm whale. This highlights the tendency of tabloids to sensationalize and fail to follow up on explanations for such discoveries."}
