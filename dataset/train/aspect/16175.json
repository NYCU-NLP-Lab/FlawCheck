{"The claim is supported by commercials aired by the Memphis Police Association": "MPA), the union representing Memphis's police officers, which state that the city's \"leadership\" has used city tax money and offered tax breaks to companies like Mitsubishi and Electrolux. These commercials also warn that the \"city leadership is threatening to lay off police and emergency services personnel to balance the budget.\"", "Memphis Mayor A C Wharton": "in a meeting with The Commercial Appeal editorial board, expressed anger towards the ads and stated that he had been seeing them running \"24-7.\"", "Mayoral spokeswoman Mary Cashiola confirmed that in the budgets presented by Mayor Wharton": "laying off fire and police personnel has never been submitted, planned, or agreed to at any level.", "MPA vice president Essica Littlejohn stated that by": "city leadership,\" the MPA was referring to Mayor Wharton himself, who expressed that police and fire personnel would not be exempt from layoffs as in years past. Littlejohn also mentioned that Mayor Wharton planted the seed of police and fire layoffs to soften the blow regarding the need for a property tax increase."}
