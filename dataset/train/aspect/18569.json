{"The claim was debunked by fact": "checking organization Snopes, who reached out to UNCF (United Negro College Fund) for verification. UNCF's senior vice president of public policy and government affairs, Lodriguez Murray, confirmed that there is no truth to the claim.", "UNCF is a private": "nonprofit organization that receives funding from private donors, not the federal government. Murray emphasized that federal funding is determined by Congress, not the executive branch.", "The copypasta meme spreading the baseless rumor was identified as the source of the claim": "The meme was shared on social media platforms, but no evidence was found to support its validity.", "It was highlighted that President Biden had actually promised increased funding for higher education": "including $70 billion for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and other institutions serving minority students as part of his campaign. This contradicts the claim that Biden revoked funding for HBCUs."}
