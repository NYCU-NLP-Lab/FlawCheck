{"Comparison of Nazi platform and Democratic Party platform": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim made by Trump Jr. is based on a comparison between the Nazi platform from the early 1930s and the Democratic Party platform of today. The expert points out that this assertion originates from D'Souza's book, which highlights similarities in areas such as nationalization of corporations, government control of banking, expropriation of land, and universal free healthcare and education.", "Reference to video interview": "The expert's verdict refers to a video interview where Trump Jr. echoes D'Souza's theme that Democrats are a crypto-Nazi party. The interview clip, linked in a tweet by Trump Jr., reportedly supports the claim by highlighting the perceived similarities between the Nazi platform and the Democratic Party's platform.", "Criticism from historians": "The expert's verdict mentions that historians of the period were consulted to assess the accuracy of the claim. It is stated that there was wide agreement among these historians that the comparison made by D'Souza and Trump Jr. is dubious and overly simplified. The historians also point out that large portions of the Nazi platform are far from present-day Democratic orthodoxy.", "Rejection of claim by a historian": "The expert's verdict includes a quote from Jeffrey Herf, a historian from the University of Maryland, who categorically rejects the claim. Herf states that there is no accuracy whatsoever in the comparison between the Nazis and the Democrats, emphasizing that the two have nothing in common. Herf's rejection of the claim adds weight to the argument against its authenticity."}
