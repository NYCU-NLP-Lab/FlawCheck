{"The claim was verified by examining the content of the Access Islam program": "which includes lesson plans and videos that provide educational information about religious traditions and holidays, as well as facts about Islam such as the practice of praying five times a day.", "The expert also considered the source of the claim": "which was a mass email sent by the Volusia County Republican Party. The email alleged that the United States Department of Education introduced an Islamic indoctrination program for public schools called 'Access Islam.'", "The expert analyzed a video by the Christian Action Network": "narrated by network founder Martin Mawyer, which criticized the Access Islam program. The video highlighted the grant money received by Access Islam from the federal government about a decade ago.", "The expert examined the availability and usage of the Access Islam materials in schools": "While it was unclear how many schools have used the materials, it was noted that there is no requirement for schools to use them. Examples were found, such as the state of Indiana listing Access Islam in a resource guide for teachers of world history, but the guide included a disclaimer stating that the materials are not intended to represent the best or only approach to any particular issue. Additionally, in Florida, high school history standards include lessons about Islam."}
