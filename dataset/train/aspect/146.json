{"The photo was published on Facebook on December 30": "2019, and has been shared more than 9,900 times. This indicates that the claim has gained traction on social media.", "The caption of the post in Hindi translates to English as": "NRC, #NPR, #CAA. The hooliganism of UP police didn\u2019t even spare a child, an example of the brutality of Yogi government.\u201d This provides context to the claim and links it to the protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act and National Register of Citizens in India.", "The claim mentions NRC": "NPR, and CAA, explaining that NRC is a government record criticized for being discriminatory against Muslims, NPR is a log of residents in India, and CAA is a new law granting citizenship to non-Muslim immigrants. This information helps understand the political and social backdrop against which the claim is made.", "The authenticity of the claim is debunked by evidence that the same photo had circulated in Pakistani media reports since at least November 2019": "depicting a child who was attacked by a dog in Okara, Pakistan. This evidence contradicts the claim and suggests that the photo is being misrepresented."}
