It was a mock-up created to resemble a legitimate news broadcast.", "The expert provides information about the actual number of COVID": "19 fatalities that occurred during the Trump administration, stating that there were 400,000 U.S. deaths from the disease, with over 100,000 occurring in Trump's final 36 days in office.", "The expert also highlights a statement made by Fox News host Sean Hannity on his radio show": "where he criticized President Biden for not taking immediate action to control the pandemic, suggesting that Biden was minimizing its severity. This statement suggests that the claim, although altered, was not far from the reality of the political discourse surrounding the pandemic."}
