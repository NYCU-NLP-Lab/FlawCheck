{"The number of recorded visits": "The expert's verdict includes information from Bernadette Green, Grothman's director of communications, who stated that as of December 2014, Al Sharpton had made 72 official recorded visits to the White House. This number was checked against the White House visitor logs.", "Possibility of unrecorded visits": "The expert's verdict also mentions that not all visits were recorded, so the actual number of visits could be higher than the recorded number. However, there is no way to determine the exact number of unrecorded visits.", "Comparison with a statement by Rudolph W": "Giuliani: The expert's verdict refers to a statement made by former New York City Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who claimed that President Barack Obama had Al Sharpton to the White House 80 to 85 times. This statement is mentioned as a point of comparison.", "Reason for concern": "The expert's verdict includes information from Green, who states that Grothman has an issue with Sharpton visiting the White House due to Sharpton's activities in the 1990s. Specifically, Sharpton's involvement in the Crown Heights riot and the Freddy's Fashion Mart incident are mentioned as reasons for concern."}
