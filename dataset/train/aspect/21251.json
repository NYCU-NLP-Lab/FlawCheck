{"The claim is based on data from the Wisconsin Technical College System": "s 2010 Graduate Follow-up Report, which surveyed 17,498 graduates from Wisconsin's 16 technical colleges. This report provided information on the employment rate of technical college graduates within six months of finishing school.", "The claim is also supported by a study conducted by Rutgers University": "which surveyed a nationally representative sample of 571 individuals who graduated from a four-year college between 2006 and 2010. This study provides a comparison to the employment rate of four-year college graduates nationwide.", "The expert mentions that the survey conducted by the Wisconsin Technical College System may not be a scientifically representative sample of all graduates": "which could potentially skew the results. This aspect highlights the need for caution when interpreting the findings and considering the generalizability of the data.", "The expert also notes that the Rutgers University study used a nationally representative sample of individuals aged 22 to 29 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 4": "5 percentage points. This aspect emphasizes the reliability and credibility of the data used to support the claim."}
