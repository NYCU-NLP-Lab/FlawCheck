{"The timing of the reporting of Milwaukee ballots": "The expert's verdict explains that the ballots in Milwaukee were reported in the early morning hours of November 4th, which was the result of the time it took to load the absentee ballots. This indicates that the delay in reporting was not suspicious or indicative of malfeasance.", "Absentee ballot processing laws in Wisconsin": "The expert highlights that Wisconsin is one of a few states that do not allow election workers to begin processing absentee ballots until Election Day. This information suggests that the delay in reporting Milwaukee's ballots was a result of the legal process in place rather than any fraudulent activity.", "Verification of election results": "The expert mentions that the November election results in Wisconsin have been counted, recounted, reviewed by officials, and confirmed by Congress. This extensive process helps to ensure the accuracy and legitimacy of the election outcome, further supporting the authenticity of the claim.", "Lack of widespread voter fraud": "The expert confirms that there was not \"widespread\" voter fraud in the 2020 election, as stated by Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu. This statement reinforces the notion that the ballot dump claim is unfounded and not supported by evidence."}
