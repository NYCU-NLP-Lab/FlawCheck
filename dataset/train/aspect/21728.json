{"Lack of evidence": "The expert's verdict highlights that there is no evidence to support Vice President Mike Pence's claim that Qassem Soleimani assisted the 9/11 terrorists. This indicates that there is a lack of concrete proof or documentation to verify the authenticity of the claim.", "Press secretary": "s response: The expert's verdict mentions that Pence's press secretary did not provide any information directly linking Soleimani to the travel of the 9/11 terrorists. This suggests that the official channels or spokespersons associated with the claim were unable to provide supporting evidence.", "Absence in the 9": "11 Commission Report: The expert's verdict points out that Qassem Soleimani is not named anywhere in the 9/11 Commission Report, which extensively documented the events and circumstances surrounding the terrorist attacks. This absence further undermines the claim's authenticity, as a comprehensive report on the subject does not attribute any involvement to Soleimani.", "Iranian facilitation of al": "Qaida members: The expert's verdict mentions that the 9/11 Commission Report states that Iranian officials were willing to facilitate the travel of al-Qaida members through Iran, but it does not specifically mention Soleimani. This indicates that while there may have been some Iranian involvement, it does not directly implicate Soleimani as claimed."}
