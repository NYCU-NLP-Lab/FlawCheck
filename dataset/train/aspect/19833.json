{"Lack of verifiable source": "The expert's verdict highlights that there is no information available about when and under what circumstances Kurt Russell allegedly made the statement. This lack of a specific source makes it difficult to verify the authenticity of the claim.", "Social media circulation": "The claim was widely circulated on social media platforms. However, the expert's investigation reveals that none of the social media accounts sharing the quote provided any additional information or context about Russell's statement. This raises doubts about the claim's authenticity.", "Originating Twitter account": "The earliest posting of the quote was found on a Twitter account named @WyattEarpLA, which uses a photograph of Kurt Russell as its profile picture and the handle \"Snake Plissken,\" referencing one of Russell's movie characters. While this account did not explicitly present the quote as if it were uttered by Russell, its association with the actor may have misled some viewers into thinking it originated from an official source.", "Lack of references in interviews or news articles": "The expert's investigation did not find any references to Kurt Russell's alleged statement in recent interviews, profiles, or news articles about the actor. This absence of supporting evidence further questions the authenticity of the claim."}
