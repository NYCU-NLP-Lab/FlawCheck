{"The total amount of U": "S. government debt and the breakdown of its ownership: The expert analyzed the national debt, which stood at $14.3 trillion, and determined that nearly $6 trillion was held by the Federal Reserve and U.S. government agencies, while the remaining $8.3 trillion was privately held debt owned by various entities such as mutual funds, pension funds, foreign investors, and other bond holders.", "China": "s ownership of U.S. government debt: The expert confirmed that China is the largest foreign owner of U.S. Treasury securities, holding approximately $1.2 trillion of U.S. debt as of March 2011. This accounted for more than a quarter of the total $4.5 trillion in U.S. treasuries held by foreign investors.", "Comparison between China": "s ownership and domestic investors: The expert concluded that there is no way that China owns more U.S. debt than domestic investors. While China holds a significant amount of U.S. debt, the roughly $3.8 trillion of privately held debt was primarily owned by United States investors such as banks, pension funds, and mutual funds.", "Interpretation of the claim by the Allen campaign": "The expert considered the explanation provided by the Allen campaign, which stated that when George Allen mentioned China owning more bonds than Americans, he was referring to debt held by ordinary American investors. The campaign provided reports from the U.S. Treasury to support this narrower contention, citing a Treasury report showing China's holdings of U.S. securities and a breakdown of U.S. treasuries held by different classes of investors."}
