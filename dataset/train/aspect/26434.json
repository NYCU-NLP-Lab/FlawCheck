{"The claim originated from a Facebook page called": "Pepsi.com\" that was created in March 2021, which is not affiliated with the official Pepsi Facebook page.", "PepsiCo": "the actual company, confirmed that the giveaway was not a legitimate promotion when it was brought to their attention.", "The claim of a": "100th anniversary\" giveaway is inaccurate as PepsiCo was founded in 1965, making the giveaway about 45 years early. Even if counting from the invention of Pepsi-Cola in 1898, the giveaway would still be 20 years late.", "The image used in the claim is a common tactic used in Facebook scams": "where users are promised a free gift but are required to provide personal information without any actual prize to claim. These scams often involve fake websites and social media pages mimicking legitimate companies to extract personal information from unsuspecting users."}
