{"The claim is supported by data from the U": "S. Census Bureau, which states that in 2015, the female-to-male earnings ratio for full-time, year-round workers was 0.80, meaning that women earned 80 cents for every dollar earned by men.", "The claim is consistent with previous statements made by experts": "such as former President Barack Obama's administration, which stated that women are paid \"77 cents on the dollar for doing the same work as men\" in 2012. However, it is important to note that this figure refers to the average disparity between men and women's earnings and does not specifically refer to the same work.", "The claim acknowledges that factors such as the degrees pursued": "jobs chosen, time taken off for childcare, and experience can contribute to the gender pay gap. However, even when these factors are excluded, studies have found a wage gap between men and women.", "Women of color experience an even greater pay gap": "as indicated by a 2014 report from the National Women's Law Center, further highlighting the intersectional nature of the gender pay gap."}
