Cuomo is that bump stocks are already illegal in the state of New York.", "The expert": "s verdict highlights the existence of a law in New York since 1931 that bans the sale, possession, and manufacture of machine guns or weapons simulating a machine gun. Bump stocks are considered to modify a gun to simulate a machine gun.", "The expert also mentions that while using a bump stock might be illegal in New York state": "owning or selling one is not. This implies that possession and sale of bump stocks are not regulated by the state or federal government.", "The State Police Spokesperson": "Beau Duffy, confirms that it is legal to have a bump stock in the back of a car in New York state, but attaching it to a semiautomatic rifle makes it illegal. This indicates that the legality of bump stocks depends on their use and attachment to firearms."}
