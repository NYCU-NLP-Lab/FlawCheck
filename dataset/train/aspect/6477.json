{"Lack of specific statistics": "The experts mentioned that there is a lack of accurate data or statistics to prove or disprove the claim made by Benjamin Crump. They contacted criminologists and other experts who confirmed that the necessary data does not exist to support or refute the claim.", "Difficulty in obtaining accurate figures": "The experts explain that it is challenging to determine the exact number of police officers charged with homicide in cases involving people of color. They mention that the closest estimate they could find was from a criminal justice researcher who identified 81 cases where at least one officer was charged with murder or manslaughter between 2005 and 2011. However, this count does not necessarily represent the number of individual officers involved.", "Lack of comprehensive data sources": "The experts highlight the limitations of the available data sources, namely the FBI and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). They mention that both sources undercount the number of deaths at the hands of law enforcement, creating difficulties in accurately assessing how often an officer is charged in such cases.", "General rarity of officer indictments": "The experts state that it is generally rare for police officers to be indicted, regardless of the race of the victim. They quote an expert who mentions that it is uncommon for an officer to be charged with homicide, implying that the claim made by Benjamin Crump about the rarity of charges against officers may have some accuracy, although it cannot be definitively proven without comprehensive data."}
