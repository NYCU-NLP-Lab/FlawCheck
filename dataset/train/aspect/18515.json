{"The claim was verified by examining the content of the May 24 letter from the U": "S. Department of Justice, which was addressed to Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, House Speaker Joe Straus, Robert Haney, chief clerk of the Texas House, and Texas Senate Secretary Patsy Spaw. The letter expressed concerns about the bill and stated that it would create significant legal and practical problems if enacted.", "The expert also considered the statement made by U": "S. Attorney John Murphy of San Antonio in the letter, where he mentioned that if the bill became law, it would directly interfere with the Transportation Security Administration's responsibility for civil aviation security. The letter further stated that the federal government would likely seek an emergency stay of the statute, and unless granted, TSA would be required to cancel flights for which it couldn't ensure the safety of passengers and crew.", "The expert examined the potential impact of the bill on air travel in Texas": "The letter suggested that if the bill passed, it could potentially make Texas a no-fly zone, as the federal government might cancel flights for which it couldn't ensure passenger and crew safety. The expert considered the definition of a no-fly zone, which generally prohibits aircraft from flying in airspace without special permission.", "The expert also took into account the source of the information": "which was the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. attorney's office in the western district of Texas. The letter was provided by Daryl Fields, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office, adding credibility to the claim's verification process."}
