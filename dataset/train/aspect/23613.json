{"Senate Agriculture Committee vote": "The first aspect employed to verify the authenticity of the claim was the vote by the Senate Agriculture Committee to compel Jon Corzine to testify. This vote confirmed that Corzine was indeed subpoenaed by his former colleagues.", "Consultation with Senate historian": "s office: The second aspect involved consulting with the Senate historian's office to determine the historical significance of Corzine's subpoena. The office confirmed that, as far as they know, Corzine is the first former senator to be subpoenaed by a Senate committee.", "Comparison with previous instances": "The third aspect involved comparing Corzine's situation with previous instances of former senators being forced to testify. While it was found that former senators have been compelled to testify before House committees, Corzine's case was unique as he was the first known instance of a former senator being subpoenaed by a Senate committee.", "Investigation into past testimony": "The fourth aspect involved investigating past instances where former senators were forced to testify before a House committee. This investigation found an example in 1908 where two former senators testified before a House committee, but no charges were brought against them. This further supported the claim that Corzine's situation was unprecedented in the context of Senate committees."}
