{"Review from News": "com: The expert's verdict mentions a review from News.com that identifies the quote as a \"quote from the production\" of the stage adaptation of George Orwell's novel 1984. This review provides evidence that the quote originated from the play and not the original novel.", "Review from Spectrum News NY1": "The expert's verdict also mentions a review from Spectrum News NY1 that highlights the quotation and refers to it as a prediction of our current state of apathy. This review further supports the claim that the quote is from the stage adaptation of 1984.", "Comparison with original novel": "The expert's verdict includes a comparison between the quote and passages from the original novel. It states that the quote does not appear in the novel, but resembles a speech made by a character named O'Brien. This comparison helps establish that the quote is not authentic to the original text.", "Attribution on Twitter": "The expert's verdict mentions the earliest iteration of the quotation on Twitter, which dates back to July 2014 during the play's run in London. It notes that the quote was initially attributed to the stage adaptation but later falsely attributed to the 1949 novel. This information suggests that the quote gained traction and was mistakenly associated with the original novel over time."}
