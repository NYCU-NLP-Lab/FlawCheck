{"The expert examined the claim made by Wayne LaPierre": "the executive vice president of the National Rifle Association, that Barack Obama endorsed a total ban on the manufacture, sale, and possession of all handguns.", "The expert investigated the historical context of the claim": "noting that a similar claim was made by the NRA in 2008 about Obama's 10-point plan to \"change\" the Second Amendment, including a ban on handguns, which was found to be false.", "The expert analyzed a questionnaire filled out by Obama": "s campaign for Illinois Senate in 1996, where they answered \"yes\" to supporting state legislation to ban the manufacture, sale, and possession of handguns. However, it was clarified that this endorsement was specific to a state level and not a \"total ban.\"", "The expert also considered Obama": "s legislative record in Illinois, which showed support for gun restrictions but no attempts to ban handguns. Additionally, they mentioned that Obama's position evolved over time, stating that a complete ban on handguns was not politically practicable but that reasonable restrictions should be imposed."}
