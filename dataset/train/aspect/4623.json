{"Changes to state laws governing cash bail in New York": "The expert's verdict mentions that statutory changes were made to how and when judges can impose cash bail in New York. These changes allow judges to set bail for mostly violent crimes but not for lesser crimes. Further changes were included in the state budget, allowing for more situations in which judges can set bail and more crimes are eligible for bail.", "Increase in crime rates": "The expert's verdict acknowledges that Trump claims the crime rate in New York has gone \"through the roof\" after the changes to cash bail. However, the verdict also highlights that increases in murders have been happening in many other cities across the country, not just in New York, and in places where there hasn't been bail reform. Other categories of violent and non-violent crime are down.", "Insufficient data to establish a link": "The expert's verdict mentions that four people who study crime data and a top official at a statewide organization representing prosecutors stated that it is too early to say whether there is a link between bail reform and the increase in crimes. They emphasized that more data is needed and cautioned that the COVID-19 pandemic and other factors could be affecting crime rates.", "Difficulty in determining the driving factors of crime rates": "The expert's verdict quotes Erica Bond, the policy director at the Data Collaborative for Justice at John Jay College, who states that it will be challenging to determine what is driving crime rates, especially if they remain high in the coming years. This suggests that identifying the specific impact of bail reform on crime rates may be complex."}
