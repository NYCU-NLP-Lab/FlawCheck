{"The most recent census numbers show that poverty is on the rise in the United States": "with median household incomes falling to their lowest level since the 1990s. This provides evidence that contradicts the claim that poverty among Americans 65 and over is statistically unchanged.", "Rachel Maddow": "a liberal talk show host, presented data on her show indicating that the U.S. poverty rate is the highest it has been since the early 1990s. She specifically mentioned that child poverty, poverty among Hispanic Americans, poverty among African-Americans, and even poverty among white people have all increased. This further challenges the claim that poverty among older Americans has remained unchanged.", "The expert mentions that Social Security is the main factor keeping older Americans out of poverty": "contrasting with the worsening poverty rates among other demographic groups. This suggests that Social Security plays a significant role in preventing poverty among Americans 65 and over.", "The expert explains how Social Security works": "highlighting that workers contribute to the program through payroll taxes and receive monthly benefits based on their average lifetime earnings. This information supports the idea that Social Security is a mechanism for preventing poverty among older Americans."}
