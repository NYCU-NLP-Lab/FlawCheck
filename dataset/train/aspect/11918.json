{"Misinterpretation of Amish lifestyle": "The claim falsely assumes that the Amish community's resistance to modern technology, such as not owning televisions, means they are unaffected by COVID-19. However, this is a misconception as COVID-19 has indeed impacted Amish communities like any other population.", "Debunking previous claims": "Fact checkers have previously debunked similar claims that COVID-19 spared Amish communities, indicating that this is not a new or accurate assertion. The claim circulating in September, suggesting that the Amish were COVID-free due to not owning TVs, was also proven false.", "Evidence of COVID": "19 impact on Amish communities: Studies and reports have shown that COVID-19 has affected Amish populations. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) conducted a study on an outbreak in a rural Ohio Amish community, which revealed that the virus spread at social gatherings where social distancing and mask-wearing practices were not followed due to community hesitancy. Additionally, news reports have highlighted the spread of COVID-19 among Amish populations in Nappanee, Indiana.", "Misleading and altered image": "The first meme used to support the claim includes an altered photo to create the impression that it was taken during the pandemic. However, the original image was actually posted in 2009 and does not show the woman wearing a mask. This manipulation of the image adds to the misinformation surrounding the claim."}
