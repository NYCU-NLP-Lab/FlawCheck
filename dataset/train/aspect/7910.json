{"Manipulated photograph": "The expert's verdict states that the photograph in question has been clearly manipulated. The lighting and lack of smoke from the burning flag indicate that the image has been Photoshopped.", "Inconsistent lighting": "The expert points out that the lighting in the photograph is incorrect, suggesting that it has been altered. This inconsistency further supports the claim that the image is not authentic.", "Age of the photograph": "The expert reveals that the photograph is close to two years old and was originally tweeted by the Seattle Seahawks in January 2016. This information discredits the claim that the image shows Michael Bennett burning the flag in the locker room.", "Source credibility": "The expert mentions that the photograph was posted on the \"Vets for Trump\" Facebook page, which did not provide contact information and listed a website registered to someone named Vladimir Lemets. This lack of transparency raises doubts about the credibility and authenticity of the claim."}
