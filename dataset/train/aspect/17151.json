{"Composite image": "The expert identified that the claim was supported by a composite image, where the top image showed intact Buddhist statues and the bottom image showed similar statues lying on the floor. This aspect was employed to verify the authenticity of the claim.", "Translation of captions": "The expert mentioned that the Sinhala-language captions on the images translated to English as \"Monk statues constructed at the Muhudu Maha Viharaya through the 2013 Deyata Kirula\" and \"By 2019, every single one of the statues had been razed.\" The translation of these captions helped in understanding the context and supporting the claim.", "Sharing on social media": "The expert noted that the misleading Facebook post had been shared almost 9,000 times. This aspect indicated that the claim had gained significant attention and was being circulated widely, which added to its credibility.", "Comparison with other claims": "The expert mentioned that the same photos used in the composite image had been shared with another claim that the statues were felled by Muslim extremists. This comparison highlighted the existence of multiple claims using the same images, suggesting that the authenticity of the claim needed further investigation."}
