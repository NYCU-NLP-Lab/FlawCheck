It happens to be the widest measure.", "The gender pay gap can be analyzed using different measures": "such as annual wages, weekly wages, and hourly rates.", "The measure of annual wages by the Census Bureau includes all male and female workers regardless of occupation": "while the weekly wage analysis by the Bureau of Labor Statistics does not account for self-employed individuals but includes some workers left out of the annual wage measure, such as teachers, construction workers, and seasonal workers."}
