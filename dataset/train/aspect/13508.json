{"The expert referred to a report by the Texas Policy Evaluation Project at the University of Texas": "which conducted a survey of 779 Texas women. This survey asked participants if they had ever tried to end a pregnancy on their own, providing a percentage of women who admitted to doing so.", "To account for potential underreporting": "the researchers also asked participants if their best friend had ever tried to self-abort. This additional question provided a separate percentage of women who believed their best friend had attempted self-abortion.", "The researchers concluded that the proportion of Texas women who have tried to self": "abort falls somewhere between the percentage who admitted to doing so and the percentage who believed their best friend had done so. This range was used to estimate the number of women, which fell between 100,000 and 240,000.", "The expert points out that the claim inaccurately states that over 100": "000 incidents occurred \"in the last year alone.\" The research actually estimates the number of women who have ever attempted self-abortion, not just in the past year."}
