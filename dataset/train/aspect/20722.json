{"The quote is sourced from Kathy Strouse": "a lead investigator into the dog fighting ring run by Michael Vick. She claims that Vick said, \"Yeah, fine. I killed the dogs. I hung them. I slammed them. I killed all of them. I lost fucking millions over some fucking dogs.\"", "There is no corroborating evidence from Vick himself or anyone else that he said exactly those words": "The quote is solely attributed to Strouse's book, \"Badd Newz: The Untold Story of the Michael Vick Dog Fighting Case.\"", "The quote was allegedly uttered by Vick shortly after failing a polygraph examination administered by the FBI": "Vick reportedly made the statement before being ushered away by his attorneys.", "While there are no other reports mentioning this specific wording": "several articles discuss Vick's failed polygraph test and his admission to killing the dogs himself. The New York Times reported in 2007 about Vick admitting to handing dogs over to others who then killed them, but it is unclear if he used the exact language quoted by Strouse."}
