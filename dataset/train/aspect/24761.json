{"The claim states that the tax cut": "if enacted, would be the largest in Texas history through the State Senate, providing $4.6 billion in property and business tax relief.", "Senator Van Taylor was one of the primary authors of Senate Bill 1": "which aimed to amend the state's mandatory homestead property tax exemption, potentially saving homeowners an average of $206 in 2016 and $233 in 2017.", "Two other measures": "also authored by Senator Taylor and more than 20 senators, reduced the state's business franchise tax rate by 15 percent and exempted an additional 61,000 small businesses from it.", "Previous instances of tax cuts in Texas history were mentioned": "such as the $15,000 homestead exemption approved in 1997 and the school property tax relief in 1999, which had respective costs of $1.04 billion and $1.4 billion to the state. The 2006 tax changes were also highlighted, which were projected to cost $14 billion every two years."}
