{"The timing of the claim": "The expert's verdict points out that the timing of the claim is inaccurate. The health care reform is estimated to provide insurance coverage to about 30 million additional people, but not until after many of the law\u2019s provisions are implemented in the years ahead. The earliest estimate for reaching 30 million newly insured Americans is 2016.", "The number of uninsured people covered": "The claim states that the president's health care bill put 30 million people on health care rolls that weren't there before. The expert's verdict confirms that the number cited by the claim is accurate, but clarifies that it refers to the estimated number of newly insured Americans once the provisions of the health care reform are fully implemented.", "Provisions of the health care reform": "The expert's verdict explains some of the major features of the health care reform, including the individual mandate, the expansion of Medicaid, and the creation of insurance exchanges. These provisions are important aspects that contribute to the goal of increasing health insurance coverage.", "Congressional Budget Office estimates": "The expert's verdict mentions that the Congressional Budget Office released estimates projecting that the health care reform would increase the number of nonelderly individuals with health insurance by 30 million as of 2016. This estimate is used to verify the claim's assertion that 30 million people will be added to the health care rolls."}
