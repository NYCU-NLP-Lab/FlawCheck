The data indicated that business confidence provides weaker evidence for Trump's assertion, as the index was at 63 in the fourth quarter of 2017, not reaching the highest levels in many decades.", "Manufacturing confidence": "The expert's analysis did not explicitly mention a distinct aspect related to manufacturing confidence."}
