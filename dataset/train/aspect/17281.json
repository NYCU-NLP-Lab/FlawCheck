{"The image used in the claim shows President Ramaphosa with a woman dancing over him in front of a crowd": "suggesting inappropriate behavior.", "The authenticity of the image was verified by comparing it to the original picture taken by AFP photographer Rodger Bosch during a visit by Ramaphosa to an informal settlement in Cape Town": "3. The image in the claim appears to be manipulated or altered, as the woman's image is more clearly defined than the rest of the people in the picture, and the background including Ramaphosa is slightly blurred.", "The claim makes a reference to Nyaope Boys and accuses Ramaphosa of dancing like them": "implying that he is on drugs. This is debunked by explaining that Nyaope is a drug popular among South Africa's poor youth, but there is no evidence to suggest that Ramaphosa is involved in drug use."}
