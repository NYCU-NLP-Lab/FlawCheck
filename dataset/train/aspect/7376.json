{"The claim was verified by referencing the testimony of Senator Rob Portman": "who stated that a couple retiring today would pay about $119,000 in lifetime Medicare taxes and receive about $357,000 in lifetime Medicare benefits. This statement was made during a hearing on health care and the federal deficit, which adds credibility to the claim.", "The claim was further supported by citing a study from the Urban Institute": "a nonpartisan public policy organization. The study, authored by Eugene Steuerle, a former Treasury Department official, provided data that backs up the claim. It states that a two-income couple earning an average wage and retiring in 2011 would pay $119,000 in Medicare taxes and receive $357,000 in benefits.", "The fact that the study from the Urban Institute has been widely cited and subsequently updated adds to the authenticity of the claim": "The fact that it has been referenced by experts and policymakers suggests that it is a credible source of information.", "The aspect of public perception and popular belief among Medicare recipients was also mentioned": "It was noted that the 3-to-1 ratio of benefits to taxes is surprising because many recipients believe they have earned and paid for their benefits. This acknowledgement of public perception adds context to the claim and further supports its authenticity."}
