{"Proposal to add a 1 percent income tax surcharge": "Tim Kaine proposed adding a 1 percent income tax surcharge as part of his farewell biennial budget proposal for 2010-2012. This proposal aimed to raise additional revenue for the state and help balance the budget.", "Maximum state income tax rate increase": "Kaine's proposal would have raised the maximum state income tax rate from 5.75 percent to 6.75 percent. This increase would apply to all taxable income above $17,000 after deductions and exemptions are taken into account.", "Applicability of the added tax to all income levels": "The bill advancing Kaine's proposal did not specify that the added tax would only be levied on taxable income of $17,000 or more. According to a spokesperson for the Virginia Department of Finance, the 1 percent surtax would have pertained to all income levels.", "Exemption for individuals with lower income levels": "Virginia does not require individuals with a state adjusted income below $11,950 and married couples with a state adjusted income below $23,900 to pay state income taxes. Therefore, those with incomes below these thresholds would be exempt from the proposed tax increase."}
