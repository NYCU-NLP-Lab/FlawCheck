{"Lack of evidence": "The expert found no evidence that Pat Robertson actually uttered the quoted statement. They searched for transcripts, news articles, and online sources but found no mention of it outside of the meme itself.", "Absence in previous records": "The quote does not appear in any previous records of Pat Robertson's statements, including his television show \"700 Club\" or any other public setting. This suggests that the claim is not based on any real occurrence.", "Fabrication and spoof": "The expert suggests that the meme is nothing more than a fabrication intended to spoof Pat Robertson and the controversies surrounding his opinions on politics and religion. This indicates that the claim is likely false and created for satirical or misleading purposes.", "Lack of credibility": "The expert's verdict, along with the absence of evidence and the meme's origin in 2018, raises doubts about the credibility of the claim. The lack of supporting information or reputable sources further undermines the authenticity of the statement attributed to Pat Robertson."}
