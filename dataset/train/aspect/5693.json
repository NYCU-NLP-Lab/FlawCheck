{"Multiple local sources": "The expert's verdict mentions that TMZ, a gossip website, cited several local sources to report on the potential purchase of the Martha's Vineyard estate by the Obamas. This indicates that the information was not solely based on a single source, but rather multiple individuals familiar with the situation.", "Escrow and offer": "The expert's verdict states that the Obamas were in escrow for the property owned by Wyc Grousbeck, the owner of the Boston Celtics. It is mentioned that the Obamas had been renting the house and decided to make an offer to purchase it. This suggests that there were negotiations and financial transactions involved in the process, further verifying the authenticity of the claim.", "Lack of public sales report": "The expert's verdict highlights that as of September 6, 2019, no sales report of the purchase had been logged with the Dukes County Registry of Deeds. This indicates that the transaction had not been officially recorded at that time, adding credibility to the claim as it aligns with the fact that the sale had not been publicly reported.", "Completion of the sale": "The expert's verdict mentions that in December 2019, the Martha's Vineyard Gazette reported that the sale had been completed. It states that the new deedholder is a nominee trust representing the Obamas, and provides details about the purchase price and the sellers. This information confirms that the transaction did indeed take place and provides specific details about the parties involved."}
