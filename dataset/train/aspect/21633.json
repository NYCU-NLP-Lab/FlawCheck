{"The claim that Kellogg": "s Corn Flakes were created to discourage masturbation is not supported by any direct evidence or statements from John Harvey Kellogg himself. The expert's verdict highlights that while Kellogg advocated for a plain, bland diet as a method to discourage masturbation, he did not specifically mention corn flakes in this context.", "The available evidence suggests that corn flakes were primarily created as a healthy and easy": "to-digest breakfast food, particularly for patients at the Kellogg sanitarium in Michigan. There is no indication that the product was ever marketed or advertised as an \"anti-masturbatory morning meal.\"", "The recent surge of interest in the origins of corn flakes was sparked by social media posts encouraging users to search for the reason behind their invention": "However, these posts often refer to a 2018 article from news.com.au that falsely claims Kellogg invented corn flakes with the intention of suppressing masturbation. This article does not provide reliable evidence and misrepresents the history of corn flakes.", "The phrase": "healthy, ready-to-eat anti-masturbatory morning meal\" has been incorrectly attributed to Kellogg and used in quotations to imply that it originated from an actual advertisement for corn flakes. In reality, this phrase was coined in a 2012 article by Mental Floss, which reported that Kellogg developed various flaked grain breakfast cereals, including corn flakes, as healthy morning meals."}
