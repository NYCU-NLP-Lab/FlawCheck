{"The image used in the claim was not recent and was not taken in Switzerland": "It was a photograph taken in 2006 in Karachi, Pakistan, depicting men burning a flag in response to outrage over cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammad.", "The source of the claim": "Frontlines News, is an anti-Muslim hate site known for publishing misleading and false information. They quoted and linked to a story from the Gatestone Institute, an anti-Muslim organization that has been accused of promoting misleading news and being amplified by a Russian troll factory.", "The Gatestone story cited only one source": "Ivica Petrusic, who was the vice president of the Swiss social justice advocacy group Second@s Plus. However, Petrusic's statement did not mention Muslims making the demand to remove the cross from the Swiss flag. The connection between Second@s and Muslims was an unfounded assertion made by Gatestone.", "The claim was rated as": "False\" because the image used was unrelated to the story, the underlying story originated from an unreliable source in 2011, and the claim itself lacked evidence of Muslims in Switzerland demanding the removal of the cross from the flag."}
