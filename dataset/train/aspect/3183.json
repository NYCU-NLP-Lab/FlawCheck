{"The claim made by Donald Trump is that there has been an increase in murder within our cities": "the biggest in 45 years.", "The expert": "s verdict confirms that Trump's claim is largely accurate, as the most recent FBI statistics show a 10.8 percent increase in murders and non-negligent homicides between 2014 and 2015, which is the biggest year-to-year jump since 1970-71.", "The expert also points out that Trump": "s terminology is imperfect, as the 10.8 percent increase represents an overall national figure and not specifically the figure for murders \"within our cities.\" However, it is acknowledged that murder rates within cities tend to be higher than the national average.", "It is noted that Trump fails to provide important context": "such as the fact that crime rates had been decreasing for a quarter-century before the recent uptick and that the recent increase is not as significant as previous year-to-year increases."}
