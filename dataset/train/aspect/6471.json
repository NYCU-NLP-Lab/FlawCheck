{"The source of the claim": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim originated from a website called ObamaWatcher, which is known for publishing humorous and satirical content. This suggests that the source of the claim is not a credible or reliable source of information.", "Lack of evidence": "The expert's verdict states that the claim about Michelle Obama's degrees being fake is unfounded and a conspiracy theory. It is mentioned that Michelle Obama graduated cum laude from Princeton University in 1985 and earned her Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree from Harvard Law School in 1988. This indicates that there is no substantial evidence supporting the claim.", "Satirical nature of the article": "The expert's verdict highlights that the article from ObamaWatcher is intended to be humorous and satirical. The website clearly states that its content is fictional and not real news. This suggests that the claim about Michelle Obama's degrees being fake should not be taken seriously.", "Credible sources contradict the claim": "The expert's verdict mentions a source called the Daily Princetonian, which published an article in 2005 titled \"Obama '85 Masters Balancing Act.\" This article provides evidence of Michelle Obama's graduation from Princeton University. Additionally, the verdict refers to Snopes.com, a reputable fact-checking website, which confirms that the claim is false. The presence of contradicting information from credible sources further verifies the authenticity of Michelle Obama's degrees."}
