{"Reduction in spending": "The expert verified that Harris had indeed reduced spending during his tenure as county executive. They confirmed that the 2013 adopted county budget set operating spending at 1 percent less than the 2005 budget, which was the last one adopted before Harris' election.", "Decrease in debt": "The expert acknowledged that Harris claimed to have reduced the county's debt, although they noted that it was only by a small amount. They confirmed that Winnebago County's outstanding general-obligation debt decreased from $63 million in December 2004 to $59.6 million at the end of 2012.", "Increase in reserves": "The expert verified that Harris had increased the county's reserves during his tenure. They found that average year-end reserves were considerably higher in the Harris era compared to the final four budget years of his predecessor. The county often maintained reserves exceeding their goal of one month of annual spending, and in 2012, reserves swelled to nearly two months of spending.", "Fluctuating spending trend": "The expert noted that while Harris had reduced spending in certain years, the overall trend was inconsistent. They found that spending had increased during Harris' first four years as county executive, and in most years, the county's annual spending total was higher than in the last pre-Harris budget. However, they acknowledged that there were some years where Harris could claim lower spending compared to when he took office."}
