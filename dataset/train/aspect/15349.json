{"Data from the U": "S. Census Bureau: The expert refers to data from the U.S. Census Bureau, which states that Texans accounted for nearly one in 10 Americans as of July 2012. This data provides a broader context for understanding the claim about minimum-wage workers in Texas.", "Quote from Stephanie Cutter": "The expert mentions a quote from Stephanie Cutter, a co-host on CNN's Crossfire, who stated that \"One out of 10 minimum-wage workers in the U.S. live in Texas.\" This quote serves as the basis for the claim and is used to support the argument.", "Statistics from Cheryl Abbot": "The expert cites statistics provided by Cheryl Abbot, a regional economist for the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Abbot's data shows that in 2012, workers paid at or below the federal minimum wage in Texas accounted for nearly 13 percent of the nation's total. This data provides specific evidence to support the claim.", "Comparison with other states": "The expert compares Texas to other states in terms of the number of workers earning minimum wage or less. The data shows that Texas had far more workers in this category compared to other states, such as New York. This comparison helps to establish the significance of Texas in relation to minimum-wage workers."}
