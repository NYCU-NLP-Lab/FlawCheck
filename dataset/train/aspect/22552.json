{"The claim is based on the New York City Government Poverty Measurement 2017 report": "which is prepared by the Mayor's Office for Economic Opportunity. This report uses a comprehensive methodology for measuring poverty that takes into account more costs of living, such as housing, child care, and medical expenses, compared to the official poverty measure by the U.S. Census Bureau.", "The poverty measurement standards and methods were established during the administration of former Mayor Michael Bloomberg and have continued under Mayor de Blasio": "This continuity ensures consistency in measuring poverty and allows for comparison of progress over time.", "The report shows that there were 236": "500 fewer people in poverty or near poverty in 2017 compared to if the poverty rate had remained at the 2013 level. This indicates a significant reduction in poverty in New York City during the last five years.", "The poverty rate in New York City declined from 20": "7 percent in 2013 to 19 percent in 2017, according to the city's definition of poverty. This decrease is supported by the Census Bureau's official poverty measure for New York City, which also shows a decline in the poverty rate between 2013 and 2017."}
