This indicates the public attention and controversy surrounding the issue.", "Trump": "s own statement at the White House on Sept. 30, 2020, is mentioned as a logical premise for the claim. Trump asserts that Biden refuses to talk about antifa and needs to condemn them, implying that Biden had not yet done so.", "The expert refutes the claim by providing evidence of Biden": "s condemnation of antifa. They mention an interview Biden conducted on Sept. 7, 2020, where he explicitly condemns antifa and violence in general. This direct statement from Biden contradicts the claim made in the original statement."}
