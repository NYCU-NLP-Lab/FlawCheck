{"The claim is attributed to Senate President Stephen Sweeney": "who made the statement during an interview on WNYC's \"The Brian Lehrer Show.\" This establishes the source of the claim and allows for further investigation into the accuracy of the statement.", "The expert": "Skip Burzumato, assistant director of the National Marriage Project at the University of Virginia, is quoted as describing the 67 percent figure as an \"odd number\" and expressing skepticism about its accuracy. This highlights the need to critically evaluate the claim and consider alternative perspectives.", "The National Center for Health Statistics": "an arm of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is referenced as a source for divorce rates in the United States. Their data shows a divorce rate of 3.4 per 1,000 people in 2009. This provides a contrasting statistic that suggests the 67 percent figure may be inaccurate.", "Paul Amato": "a professor of family sociology and demography at Pennsylvania State University, is cited as stating that estimates of divorce rates are around 45 percent, with an additional few percent of couples separating but not divorcing. This provides further evidence that contradicts the claim of a 67 percent divorce rate and supports a lower likelihood of marriages ending in divorce."}
