{"The claim is based on Attorney General Jeff Sessions": "testimony to Congress about the recent increase in the rate of violent crime and murder in the United States.", "The claim is supported by data from the FBI": "s Uniform Crime Report for 2016, which shows a 6.8 percent increase in the violent crime rate and a 20.4 percent increase in the murder rate from 2014 to 2016.", "The expert acknowledges that the numbers provided by Sessions are accurate but points out that they do not show the full picture": "On average, violent crime has been declining over the last 30 years, with the rate reaching its highest point in 1991 and decreasing since then.", "Different experts have varying interpretations of the recent increase in violent crime and murder rates": "Some view it as a worrying sign that could indicate the start of a new trend, while others argue that it is a relatively small uptick and that the overall crime rates are still lower than they were a decade ago."}
