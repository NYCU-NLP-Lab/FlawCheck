{"NASA did not spend over": "165 million over 10 years to develop a pen that writes in zero gravity, upside down, and in extreme temperatures. The claim that NASA spent such a significant amount of money on a space pen is false.", "Both U": "S. astronauts and Soviet Union cosmonauts used pencils on their first space missions. NASA ordered mechanical pencils for Project Gemini, which cost $128.89 per pencil, not millions of dollars.", "The Fisher Pen Company": "not NASA or Congress, invested about $1 million in developing a ballpoint pen that could operate in space. In 1965, Fisher patented the Space Pen, which had a pressurized ink cartridge and could write in various conditions, including extreme temperatures.", "NASA was cautious about allowing flammable objects like pencils on board after a fire incident during the Apollo 1 test mission": "They searched for a cheaper and safer option, leading to the adoption of the Fisher Space Pen."}
