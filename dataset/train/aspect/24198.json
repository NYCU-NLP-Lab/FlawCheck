{"Lack of credible sources": "The expert found that there were no credible sources to back the claim that Delta Air Lines offers discounted rates to members of Planned Parenthood. The information found was only unverified claims in comment sections of articles and random social media messages.", "Denial by Planned Parenthood": "Planned Parenthood denied the claims made by Georgia State Senator Michael Williams that Delta Air Lines offers discounted rates to their members. This denial adds to the lack of evidence supporting the claim.", "Inability to verify the claim": "When questioned about the evidence for the claim, Senator Williams admitted that he had looked it up on Google but did not have the exact source. This further undermines the credibility of the claim.", "Irrelevant connection to NRA boycott": "The claim about Delta Air Lines offering discounted rates to Planned Parenthood members was made in response to the boycott of the National Rifle Association (NRA). However, the connection between these two issues is irrelevant, as Planned Parenthood has no direct or indirect involvement with the Parkland shooting or the NRA."}
