{"The expert": "s analysis of FBI data: The expert refers to FBI data that shows the U.S. murder rate was lower in 2014 and that the overall violent crime rate has been lower in several past years. This data contradicts President Trump's claim that the crime statistics are at a level they haven't been before.", "Historical crime trends": "The expert mentions that crime rates have been generally declining for years, even before Trump took office. This indicates that the current crime statistics are not at an unprecedented level as claimed by the President.", "Previous false claims by President Trump": "The expert highlights that President Trump has a history of distorting facts on crime. As a candidate in 2016, he made false claims about the murder rate and hyped year-over-year increases in some cities. This pattern of misinformation raises doubts about the authenticity of his current claim.", "Expert opinions": "The expert quotes Richard Rosenfeld, a professor emeritus at the University of Missouri\u2013St. Louis, and Richard Berk, a professor of criminology and statistics at the University of Pennsylvania. Both experts refute President Trump's claim and emphasize that crime has been declining for a long time, contradicting the notion of crime statistics being at an unprecedented level."}
