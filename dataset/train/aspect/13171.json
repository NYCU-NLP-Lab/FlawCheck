{"Lack of context and divergent information": "The claim lacked specific details and the accompanying photograph could be found on multiple online dating sites with conflicting information about the man's identity and origin.", "Inconsistent claims and accusations": "The claim was associated with various locations including Nigeria, Zambia, New York City, and others, making it difficult to verify its authenticity. Additionally, the Zambian Observer accused the man of committing several murders but appeared to have ulterior motives in using him as an anti-immigrant scapegoat.", "Lack of corroboration from authorities": "Police officials in New York City, Washington D.C., and Toledo, Ohio, denied any knowledge or existence of the claim or allegations about a \"murder cab.\" The New York State Department of Motor Vehicles also confirmed that the license plate mentioned in the claim did not match any registered vehicle.", "Absence of official confirmation": "Despite efforts to seek comments from police in Zambia, no response was received at the time of publication. This lack of official confirmation adds to the skepticism surrounding the claim's authenticity."}
