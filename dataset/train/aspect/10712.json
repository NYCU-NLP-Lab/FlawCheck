{"The claim made by Jeanne Shaheen": "s opponent, Scott Brown, is that she has \"voted with the president 99 percent of the time.\" This claim has been repeated frequently by Brown in various campaign ads, indicating its significance in the race for U.S. Senate.", "PolitiFact New Hampshire previously investigated a similar claim made by the New Hampshire Republican Party in a web video titled": "99 Percent.\" The video asserted that Shaheen consistently supports the president and \"votes with Obama 99 percent of the time.\" This ad was released before Brown officially entered the race.", "To verify the authenticity of the claim": "PolitiFact New Hampshire examined Shaheen's voting record. They requested evidence from the NHGOP, who directed them to Congressional Quarterly's annual presidential position votes report. According to the 2013 CQ analysis, Shaheen's vote aligned with Obama's stance 99 percent of the time when considering the pool of votes where Obama had a clear position.", "Further analysis by WMUR political reporter James Pindell revealed that out of the 108 votes where Obama had a clear stance": "70 were related to presidential nominations, and the remaining 38 involved public policy matters. These findings suggest that Shaheen's alignment with the president's stance was not limited to just nominations but also extended to various public policy issues."}
