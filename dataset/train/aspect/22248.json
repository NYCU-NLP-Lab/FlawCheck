{"Comparison of budget numbers": "The expert examined the budget numbers for the pre-K initiative and found that Gov. Bob McDonnell's proposed budget actually increased funding for the program, contradicting the claim that he wanted to cut it.", "Evaluation of funding levels recommended by the state Board of Education": "The expert assessed the funding levels recommended by the state Board of Education for the pre-K initiative and compared them to Gov. McDonnell's proposed budget. It was found that while McDonnell's budget allocated less funding than the Board's recommendation, the Board's recommendation does not hold the authority to appropriate funds.", "Analysis of the method used to estimate the number of eligible children": "The expert examined the governor's proposed new method to estimate the number of children eligible for the pre-K program. It was discovered that this new method assumed partial participation, resulting in a lower projected expenditure for the program. However, it was noted that the program is voluntary, and the legislature has historically funded it based on anticipated 75 percent participation.", "Consideration of the impact on disadvantaged children": "The expert took into account the potential impact of any changes to the pre-K program on disadvantaged 4-year-olds. While the claim asserted that the program would be cut, the expert's analysis showed that Gov. McDonnell's proposed budget actually increased funding for the program, suggesting a commitment to supporting the educational needs of disadvantaged children."}
