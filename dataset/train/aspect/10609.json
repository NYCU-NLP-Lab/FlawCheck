{"Analysis of the adopted budget by the Legislative Budget Board": "The expert referred to an analysis of the state budget by the Legislative Budget Board, which provides information on \"full-time-equivalent positions\" (FTEs) in the budget. This analysis helps verify the authenticity of the claim regarding the number of state jobs being cut.", "Reduction of FTEs in the budget": "The expert mentioned that the new state budget provides for 235,240 FTEs in fiscal year 2012 and 235,135 FTEs in 2013, compared to 240,862 FTEs in the current fiscal year. This indicates a reduction of 5,727 FTEs by 2013, supporting the claim that state jobs are being cut.", "Definition of FTEs and potential job count discrepancies": "The state auditor's office clarified that one FTE position does not necessarily equate to one job. It could represent a combination of employees whose hours total 40. This information highlights the possibility of greater job cuts than the number of FTEs being reduced.", "Reports of layoffs at state agencies": "The expert mentioned that news about layoffs at state agencies has been reported, including layoffs at the Texas Education Agency, Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, University of Texas, and University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. These reports provide additional evidence to support the claim of job cuts."}
