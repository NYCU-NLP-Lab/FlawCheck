{"Reverse Google image search": "The expert used a reverse Google image search to verify the authenticity of the claim. This search revealed that some of the images shared on Facebook were actually from previous events, such as the Cleveland Cavaliers championship parade in 2016.", "Comparison with known events": "The expert compared the images shared in the claim with known events, such as the Cleveland Cavaliers championship parade and the People's Vote march in London. By identifying landmarks and matching the images to these events, the expert was able to determine that the images were not from the pro-Trump rally in DC.", "Verification of sources": "The expert checked the sources of the images and found that they were sourced from unrelated events. For example, one image was sourced from an Associated Press photographer who took it during the Cleveland Cavaliers championship parade. This verification helped establish that the images were not authentic.", "Request for comment and subsequent deletion": "The expert noted that USA TODAY requested comment from the user who made the viral Facebook post claiming to show the \"million plus Trump supporters,\" and the post was subsequently deleted. This suggests that the user may have realized the inauthenticity of the claim and removed the post."}
