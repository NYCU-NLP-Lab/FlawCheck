{"U": "S. law has long provided for composers to be paid for over-the-air radio play, but the actual performers have never received money for radio play. This aspect highlights the discrepancy in payment between composers and performers in the U.S.", "Federal law was revised in 1995 to require services that stream music to pay performers for what goes out over the Internet": "However, on-the-air or terrestrial radio stations were exempted from this requirement. This aspect highlights the difference in payment policies between different types of radio platforms.", "The U": "S. Copyright Office's report from February 2015, which calls for the exemption of terrestrial radio stations to be removed, states that the U.S. is an outlier internationally. It mentions that only a handful of countries, including China, North Korea, and Iran, lack a radio performance right. This aspect provides evidence of the claim's accuracy by citing an official report.", "The Recording Industry Association of America": "a trade group for recording companies, has verified the claim about the four countries (China, North Korea, Iran, and the U.S.) that do not provide radio-performance rights. This aspect adds credibility to the claim by citing an industry association's research."}
