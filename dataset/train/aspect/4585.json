{"The claim is based on a report issued by Everytown for Gun Safety": "an advocacy group founded by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. The report examined firearm homicides of women by intimate partners in 14 states that had background checks for some or all private handgun sales.", "The report found that in these states": "the rate of such murders was 46 percent lower compared to the rest of the nation. This statistic supports the claim that \"49 percent fewer women are shot and killed\" in states with private-sale background checks for handguns.", "The expert": "Lori Haas, is the state director of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence and has personal experience with gun violence as her daughter was grazed during the Virginia Tech shootings in 2007. Haas spoke at a news conference advocating for tighter firearm laws, including closing the loophole in Virginia's background check laws.", "The claim highlights the fact that Virginia and 32 other states do not require background checks for firearms bought through unlicensed sellers": "This loophole allows certain individuals to purchase guns without undergoing a background check, potentially posing a risk to public safety, particularly women. Closing this loophole is seen as a matter of life and death for women, according to the expert's verdict."}
