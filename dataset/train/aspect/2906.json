{"The absence of an official statement from Nike": "The expert's verdict mentions that no such statement was found or archived on Nike's social media accounts, and the company confirmed via email that the statement did not originate from them. This verifies the claim's inauthenticity.", "Lack of evidence from PRWeb": "The expert's verdict states that a user claimed to have found the alleged statement on the PRWeb website but it had been deleted. However, a staff member for PRWeb referred them to Nike and did not provide further comment. This lack of evidence supports the claim being false.", "Hoax picture of burning Nike shoes": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim refers to separate pictures of people burning Nike shoes while wearing them. However, it is revealed that the picture set was a hoax posted by a Twitter user who used a photograph of a different foot burn patient. This discredits the claim's authenticity.", "Inaccurate statistic about homeless veterans": "The expert's verdict states that the claim mentions veterans comprising \"nearly a fifth of all homeless people.\" However, federal data from the Department of Housing and Urban Development contradicts this, showing that the U.S. homeless veteran population is estimated to be around 40,000, which is far less than 20% of the overall homeless population. This discrepancy further undermines the claim's credibility."}
