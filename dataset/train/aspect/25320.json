{"The claim was based on a headline that exaggerated and misrepresented the statements made by IRS Commissioner John Koskinen during a Senate Finance Committee hearing in April 2016": "2. The expert tracked down the transcript of the hearing and found that Koskinen never admitted that the IRS \"encourages\" undocumented people to \"steal\" Social Security numbers.", "Koskinen actually stated that many undocumented individuals were using Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers": "ITIN) on their tax forms but then using someone else's Social Security number to get a job.", "In these cases": "the individuals using someone else's Social Security number were often doing so with the knowledge and consent of the person whose number they were using, making the situation less clear-cut as identity theft."}
