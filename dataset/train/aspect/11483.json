{"The expert": "s verdict highlights that the claim of 7,182 students being \"killed in U.S. schools\" since 2012 is inflated and likely refers to all firearm fatalities involving children, including suicides and shootings off campus.", "The expert provides a count of 64 students who have been shot and killed on school grounds since the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre in 2012": "indicating that the actual number is significantly lower than the claim.", "The expert identifies that the inflated number of 7": "182 in the claim is a misrepresentation of the 7,000 pairs of shoes laid out in front of the U.S. Capitol to symbolize the number of children killed by gun violence since the Sandy Hook shooting, according to the advocacy group Avaaz.", "The expert compares the claim to counts provided by other organizations and sources": "such as Everytown, which advocates reducing gun violence and has counted 170 deaths from 2013 to the end of 2018. This demonstrates that different methodologies and criteria are used to count school shooting deaths, but none of them reach the high number of 7,182 claimed in the meme."}
