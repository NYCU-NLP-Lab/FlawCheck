{"The date and context of the photograph": "The expert's verdict provides information about when and where the photograph was taken, stating that it was captured on 11 November 1973 during the third quarter of a New York Jets game against the New England Patriots. This establishes the specific event and timeframe of the image.", "Source and authenticity of the photograph": "The expert mentions that the photograph was taken by Barton Silverman of the New York Times and is available on the \"Lively Morgue\" Tumblr page, which showcases the newspaper's archive of photographs. This indicates a reliable source for the image and adds credibility to its authenticity.", "Clarification of the subject matter": "The expert clarifies that the photograph has nothing to do with the national anthem, patriotism, or protesting. They state that it shows Joe Namath and Al Woodall on the sidelines during the game, unrelated to any pre-game ceremonies or protests. This helps debunk the claim made in the original caption of the photograph.", "Corroborating evidence": "The expert mentions a contemporary news report regarding the same football game, confirming that Woodall started the game in place of an injured Namath but left during the second quarter due to an injured elbow. The presence of both injured quarterbacks on the sidelines further supports the fact that the photograph was taken long after the pre-game ceremonies, reinforcing the conclusion that it does not show Namath kneeling during the national anthem."}
