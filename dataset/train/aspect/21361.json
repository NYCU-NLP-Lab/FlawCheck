{"The expert identified that the photograph in question is a composite image created by combining two unrelated pictures": "The bottom half of the image is from a photograph taken for People Magazine, featuring Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. The top half of the image is from a photograph taken by Elias Valverde II of The Shorthorn, showing a group of people burning American flags during a protest in Arlington, Texas.", "The expert pointed out that the original captions of the two separate photographs clearly indicate their unrelated contexts": "The caption of the People Magazine photograph mentions Biden and Harris being photographed outside Wilmington, Delaware, while the caption of the photograph from The Shorthorn describes protesters burning flags during a demonstration against police brutality in Arlington, Texas.", "The expert highlighted that the composite image was created with the intention of falsely connecting Biden and Harris to the violent aspects of the protests that occurred during the summer of 2020": "However, it is important to note that on the day after the photograph of protesters burning the flag was taken, Biden delivered a speech denouncing such violent acts and emphasizing the need for peaceful protests.", "The expert mentioned that this is not the first instance of digital manipulations involving the original photograph of Biden and Harris": "In August 2020, the image was reimagined as a fake album cover on Reddit, indicating that it has been subject to various forms of alteration and misuse."}
