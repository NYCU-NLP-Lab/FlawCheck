{"Lack of evidence": "The expert found no evidence of Jon Ossoff proposing any broad-based tax increases, such as an income tax hike. This suggests that the claim of Ossoff wanting to raise taxes lacks supporting evidence.", "Campaign statements": "The expert examined Ossoff's campaign website and found that it made little mention of taxes, stating only that he would work to reduce the tax burden on small businesses and simplify tax filing for them. This indicates that Ossoff's campaign messaging does not align with the claim of him wanting higher taxes.", "Q": "A response: In a written Q&A with the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Ossoff stated that he would seek to simplify the tax code and eliminate carve-outs and special treatment that benefit large organizations at the expense of small businesses. This suggests that Ossoff's stance on taxes is focused on reforming the tax system rather than raising taxes.", "Lack of response from the White House": "The expert reached out to the White House press office to inquire about the support for Trump's claim of Ossoff wanting higher taxes but did not receive a response. This lack of response indicates a potential lack of evidence or support for the claim."}
