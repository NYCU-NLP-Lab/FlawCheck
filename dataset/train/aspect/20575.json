{"Testimony from Hillary Clinton": "The expert mentions that in her memoir, Clinton defends the use of drone strikes and specifically states that \"dozens of senior terrorists had been taken off the battlefield\" by drones. This provides a firsthand account and supports the authenticity of the claim.", "Analysis by the New America Foundation": "The expert refers to an analysis conducted by the New America Foundation, a think tank, which found that drones have killed about 58 known militant leaders in Pakistan and 35 in Yemen. This analysis provides empirical evidence and adds credibility to the claim.", "Expert opinion from Daveed Gartenstein": "Ross: The expert quotes Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, who states that \"Hillary Clinton's statement is 100 percent correct\" and that it may even be a conservative estimate. This expert opinion reinforces the claim's authenticity.", "Lack of definitive data": "The expert acknowledges that there are no definitive lists of drone strikes or casualties caused by them, highlighting the challenge of obtaining accurate information due to tight secrecy. This aspect emphasizes the difficulty in verifying the claim but also suggests that the actual number of senior terrorists killed by drones may be higher than reported."}
