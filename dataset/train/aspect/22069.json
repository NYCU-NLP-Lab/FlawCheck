{"The claim made by Pete Buttigieg is in regards to the income of the bottom 90 percent of the population since 1973": "The expert's verdict examines the accuracy of this claim.", "The expert": "s verdict states that while the exact data set fitting Buttigieg's wording could not be found, a similar data set calculated by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) was used. This data set covers the period from 1979 to 2015, which is most of the period in question.", "The CBO data set": "adjusted for inflation and federal taxes, shows income growth for different economic ranges, including the lowest 20 percent, the middle 60 percent, the 81st to 99th percentile, and the top 1 percent. While these ranges do not precisely match Buttigieg's parameters, economists consider them useful for determining the overall trend.", "The analysis of the CBO data shows that while the income growth for the bottom 90 percent is not as significant as that of the top 1 percent": "it does show an increase after adjusting for inflation. This suggests that Buttigieg's claim that the income of the bottom 90 percent didn't budge or even retreated a little bit since 1973 is not entirely accurate."}
