{"The claim made by Congressman Doug LaMalfa regarding H": "R. 1 forcing states to restore voting rights for convicted felons, including violent felons convicted of murder or rape.", "The actual provisions of H": "R. 1, which state that voting rights would be restored for individuals convicted of a crime only once they are out of jail or prison.", "The existing voting rights restoration policies in the majority of states": "including California, which already restore voting rights for individuals convicted of a crime either automatically upon release or after a certain period of time.", "The language used in H": "R. 1, which does not explicitly mention murderers or rapists as being eligible to have their voting rights restored, but rather states that individuals convicted of a crime can still vote unless they are serving a felony sentence in a correctional institution or facility at the time of the election."}
