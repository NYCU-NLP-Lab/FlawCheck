{"The testimony of Susan Yoshihara": "director of research at the Catholic Family and Human Rights Institute, who argued against same-sex marriage and claimed that scholarly basis for the claims that it doesn't make a difference whether a child is raised by a mother and father or by adults engaged in homosexual lifestyles has been shattered by the latest social science and research.", "The existence of numerous peer": "reviewed studies on same-sex couples raising children, including the National Longitudinal Lesbian Family Study, which has been following lesbian mothers since 1986 and found that the children raised by those couples rated themselves comparably to their counterparts in opposite-sex parent families in terms of quality of life.", "The support of the American Academy of Pediatrics": "which announced in 2013 that it supports same-sex marriage based on extensive data from over 30 years of research, revealing that children raised by gay and lesbian parents have demonstrated resilience in social, psychological, and sexual health.", "The study conducted by Regnerus and published in Social Science Research in 2012": "which asserted that previous studies finding no notable disadvantages or differences for children raised by same-sex couples were flawed and that his study provided evidence of negative outcomes for such children."}
