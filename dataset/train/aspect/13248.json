{"The expert explains that the Nazi salute is delivered by raising an outstretched right arm with the palm down": "and the photograph shows Ashlyn Harris raising her left arm, not her right. This aspect verifies that Harris is not giving the Nazi salute.", "The expert mentions that the photograph originated from the social media pages of the Museum of Jewish Heritage in Lower Manhattan": "which had shared it along with a celebratory message regarding the U.S. Women's Soccer Team's World Cup win. This aspect verifies that the museum itself did not interpret the gesture as a Nazi salute but rather as a part of the team's celebration.", "The expert compares Harris": "gesture to the celebratory pose struck by her teammate Megan Rapinoe after scoring a goal, implying that it is more similar to a celebratory gesture rather than a Nazi salute. This aspect further supports the claim that Harris was not giving a Nazi salute.", "The expert provides a reference to the Anti": "Defamation League's definition of the Hitler salute, which further confirms that Harris' gesture does not match the criteria for a Nazi salute. This aspect reinforces the authenticity of the claim."}
