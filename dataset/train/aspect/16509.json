{"State Sen": "Kathleen Vinehout's claim: State Sen. Kathleen Vinehout, D-Alma, claimed that Wisconsin manufacturing jobs are still 16,000 lower than during the recession. This is the initial claim that is being evaluated.", "Comparison to recession levels": "Vinehout compared the number of manufacturing jobs in Wisconsin at the end of 2008 (494,427) to the number of manufacturing jobs in June 2017 (472,000), using data from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis and Wisconsin's Department of Workforce Development. This comparison was used to support her claim.", "Foxconn factory deal": "The announcement of the Foxconn factory deal, which could potentially create 13,000 jobs, was mentioned as a counterpoint to Vinehout's claim. The implication is that this deal could help boost the manufacturing job numbers in Wisconsin.", "Manufacturing job deficit": "Despite the discrepancy in the exact numbers used by Vinehout, it is acknowledged that Wisconsin's manufacturing sector has not yet fully recovered to the levels it had before the recession. This aspect highlights the overall trend of slower manufacturing job growth in the state."}
