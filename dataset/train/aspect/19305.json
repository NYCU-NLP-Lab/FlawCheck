{"The expert found that the claim made by U": "S. Rep. Dave Brat was overly broad and misleading. Brat's statement suggested that the education committee in Congress was deciding what would be in all local salad bars, but the expert clarified that he was actually referring to salad bars in schools.", "The expert pointed out that there is a reauthorization bill called the": "Improving Child Nutrition Education Act of 2016,\" which was approved by the House Committee on Education and the Workforce. This bill includes provisions that would put new restrictions on a federal program offering free breakfasts and lunches to low-income students. It also aims to give states more control over free-meals programs and allows flexibility in setting up and running salad bars in schools.", "The expert highlighted that the claim about the education committee deciding the contents of all local salad bars is not accurate": "In reality, the bill only includes one sentence instructing the USDA to create regulations that would give free-meal schools flexibility in setting up and running salad bars. This contradicts Brat's claim of the education committee deciding what goes into any salad bar, whether it is in schools or elsewhere.", "The expert mentioned that salad bars were only briefly discussed during a five": "hour debate on the bill. This indicates that the topic of salad bars was not a major focus of the education committee's discussions or decisions."}
