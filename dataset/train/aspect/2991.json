{"The email claims that if the Trans": "Pacific Partnership is fast-tracked through the Senate, it won't receive a committee assignment and there will be no debate.

This information was provided by a reader who sent the email to the fact-checking organization.", "The Trans": "Pacific Partnership is a trade agreement being negotiated among the United States, Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, and Vietnam. If enacted, it would set the ground rules for trade between these twelve nations, which collectively account for approximately 40% of the world's economy.", "The email claims that the Trans": "Pacific Partnership would grant President Obama \"the powers of a king\" to negotiate all future trade deals, which the expert's verdict states is false. The agreement is a trade initiative pursued by the Obama administration, but it does not give the president unlimited powers and is subject to the normal legislative process."}
