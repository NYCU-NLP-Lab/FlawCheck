{"The claim stated that": "NASA says an asteroid bigger than a football pitch is heading towards Earth.\" The first aspect employed to verify the authenticity of this claim was checking the database maintained by the Center for Near Earth Object Studies at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. This database confirmed that the asteroid in question, 2016 NF23, is indeed on the list of objects that have had a \"close approach\" to Earth.", "The second aspect was the analysis of the predicted closest approach date and distance of the asteroid": "According to the database, the asteroid is estimated to be closest to Earth on August 29, 2018. However, even at its closest approach, it will be more than 3 million miles away from Earth, which is more than 13 times the distance between the Earth and its moon. This information reassures that the asteroid will not pose a direct threat to Earth.", "The third aspect involved the clarification of the term": "potentially hazardous\" used in the claim. The Wakefield Express article had incorrectly labeled 2016 NF23 as a \"potentially hazardous\" asteroid, but the expert from the Center for Near Earth Object Studies clarified that it is not classified as such. The asteroid's absolute magnitude and size make it unsuitable for the Potentially Hazardous Asteroid classification.", "The fourth aspect was the expert": "s statement that the claim of the asteroid \"skimming\" past Earth was incorrect. The expert explained that while the asteroid's closest approach may be considered close from an astronomical perspective, it is not close from a human perspective. The distance of over 3 million miles ensures that the asteroid will not pose any immediate danger to Earth."}
