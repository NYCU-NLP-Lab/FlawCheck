{"The number of bills sponsored that became law": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim made by Jeb Bush was about the three senators on the debate stage, Rand Paul, Marco Rubio, and Ted Cruz, having only two bills combined that became law. The expert verifies this aspect by evaluating the legislative records of the senators using Congressional Quarterly's BillTrack database and GovTrack's advanced legislation search.", "Contextual factors affecting legislative success": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim leaves out important context, such as external factors that may have worked against the senators in getting their bills passed. This aspect highlights that legislative success is influenced by various factors beyond the control of the senators, and the claim may not provide a complete measure of their impact in Congress.", "Incomplete measure of impact": "The expert's verdict points out that the claim's focus on the number of bills becoming law is an incomplete measure of a senator's impact in Congress. This aspect suggests that other factors, such as cosponsorship of bills and overall contribution to legislative discussions, should also be considered when assessing a senator's effectiveness.", "Comparison to other senators": "The expert's verdict mentions that a previous analysis by National Journal found that the longer a senator had been in office, the more bills they were likely to pass. This aspect implies that comparing the legislative records of the three senators to those of their colleagues who have served longer may provide a more comprehensive perspective on their effectiveness in Congress."}
