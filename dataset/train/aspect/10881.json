{"Lack of evidence in the KPIX": "TV article: The expert notes that the KPIX-TV article mentioned in Brandon Straka's tweet did not provide any evidence to support his claim that the mural required 700 gallons of aerosol spray paint. This lack of evidence raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Origin of the 700": "gallon figure: The expert suggests that the figure of 700 gallons might have originated from an article on The Blaze, a right-leaning website. However, it is unclear where this figure came from, and it is possible that it was an extrapolation based on the use of 500 cans of spray paint for a smaller project. The origin and accuracy of this figure are important aspects to consider when verifying the claim.", "Response from One Atmosphere": "One Atmosphere, a California environmental non-profit group that collaborated on the mural, addressed concerns about the use of aerosol spray paint in an Instagram post. They explained that the vast majority of the paint used was water-based acrylic exterior paint applied by hand. Only the finishing details required spray paint, which was used in low-pressure cans without CFCs (which are harmful to the environment). This response provides important information about the materials and methods used in creating the mural, contributing to the verification process.", "Recycling and environmental considerations": "The expert mentions that One Atmosphere stated that the spray paint cans and boxes used for the mural would be recycled. This aspect highlights the environmental consciousness of the project and reinforces the credibility of the claim, as it aligns with the goal of promoting climate awareness and sustainability through the mural."}
