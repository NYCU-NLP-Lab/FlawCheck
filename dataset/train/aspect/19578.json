{"Data from the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse": "TRAC) at Syracuse University: The spokesperson for Senator Durbin pointed to data from TRAC, which provides figures on the number of individuals deported from Illinois and their most serious criminal conviction, if any was listed by ICE. This data showed that in the first 11 months of the 2018 fiscal year, 853 individuals were deported from Illinois, with 160 classified as having serious criminal convictions.", "Classification of offense codes": "TRAC's data showed that ICE classifies offenses into three levels, with the most serious level covering \"aggravated felonies.\" This includes both violent and non-violent offenses. It was found that 160 individuals deported from Illinois had serious criminal convictions, which aligns with Senator Durbin's claim of fewer than 20% being charged with any serious crime.", "Limitations of the data": "Experts mentioned that the definition of \"Illinois' deportations\" and what constitutes being \"charged with any serious crime\" can have an impact on the interpretation of the data. The location from which an individual departs the country may not necessarily be where they resided or were arrested before deportation, and these details are not provided by ICE.", "Expert analysis": "Guillermo Cantor, research director at the American Immigration Council, analyzed deportation data and highlighted that the removal dataset does not provide information about the history of the person. This suggests that the data alone may not fully capture the criminal backgrounds or potential threats posed by deported individuals."}
