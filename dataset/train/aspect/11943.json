{"The claim was supported by a press release from the Texas Health Care Association": "which cited a University of Texas/Texas Tribune poll that found 90 percent of Texans opposing cuts to state-funded nursing home care. This poll was used as evidence to verify the claim.", "The expert analyzed the relevant question in the poll": "which asked respondents to check all the measures they think should be taken to reduce spending. Only 10 percent of respondents checked the option to cut state funding for nursing home care, indicating that 90 percent opted to not cut nursing home funding. This data was used to verify the claim.", "The expert also considered the warning from advocates that proposed cuts of 33 percent to nursing homes accepting Medicaid would lead to closures": "This information was provided by the Austin American-Statesman article and was used to support the claim.", "The expert mentioned the statement made by state Rep": "Sylvester Turner, who argued for tapping into the rainy day fund to prevent nursing home closures. Turner claimed that \"90 percent of Texans say they do not want the nursing homes to close\" and emphasized that it polled higher than anything else. While this statement was not directly cited as evidence, it was mentioned as part of the context surrounding the claim."}
