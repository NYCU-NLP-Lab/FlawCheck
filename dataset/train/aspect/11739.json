{"The claim is supported by a recent study mentioned in a New York Times article": "2. The study calculates that taxes would need to be increased by an average of $1,300 a year nationally and $813 a year in Florida to support public employee pensions.", "The study also mentions that these tax increases are necessary to meet the currently unsustainable pension obligations for state and local government retirees": "4. The claim is further validated by the fact that the recently signed pension reform law in Florida requires state workers to contribute 3 percent of their salaries towards retirement and eliminates cost-of-living increases on benefits earned after July 1."}
