{"Expert": "s personal experience and knowledge: The expert, Dr Philip Ikeme, who is the medical director of the Nigeria, Ghana, and eastern African arm of pharmaceutical giant Sanofi, stated that Nigeria now has the highest incidence of diabetes in sub-Saharan Africa. His expertise in the field and his role in a leading pharmaceutical company provide credibility to his claim.", "Comparison with previous data": "Dr Ikeme mentioned that three years ago, South Africa and Ethiopia had more cases of diabetes than Nigeria. This comparison indicates a shift in the prevalence of diabetes in the region and supports the claim that Nigeria currently has the highest incidence.", "Reference to studies on diabetes in Nigeria": "Dr Ikeme directed Africa Check to two studies on diabetes in Nigeria. These studies, one from 2008 and another from 2014, estimated that 1.7 million and 4 million Nigerians, respectively, were living with diabetes. While the expert acknowledged that the actual number could be higher, these studies provide some evidence to support his claim.", "Lack of specific data from the World Health Organisation": "WHO): The WHO's most recent report on diabetes does not include specific data on new cases (incidence) in Nigeria or sub-Saharan Africa. The report states that data on new cases is generally lacking. Additionally, the WHO noted that only 17% of countries in sub-Saharan Africa have a diabetes registry. This lack of specific data on incidence in Nigeria makes it challenging to verify the claim definitively."}
