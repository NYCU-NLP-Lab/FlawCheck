{"Bill Gates did not say that 80": "of people who took the Moderna vaccine experienced significant side effects.", "A U": "S. Food and Drug Administration report stated that only 0.5% of individuals who received the Moderna vaccine experienced a \"severe adverse event.\"", "Reports of": "severe adverse events\" associated with the Moderna vaccine are extremely rare.", "The Facebook post claiming that": "80% of people taking the Moderna vaccine had significant side effects, via Bill Gates\" is misleading and inaccurate."}
