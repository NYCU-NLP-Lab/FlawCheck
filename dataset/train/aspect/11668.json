{"Lack of documentation": "The expert's investigation revealed that there was no documentation provided by Walker's spokesman to support the claim that unions falsely told their members about the percentage of income required for health insurance premiums.", "Private testimonies": "Walker claimed to have heard privately from teachers around the state about the misinformation spread by unions. However, no specific individuals or instances were identified to validate these claims.", "Public statements by Walker": "The expert highlighted that Walker publicly spoke about his plan to increase health and pension contributions before the protests and the introduction of the budget-repair bill. This suggests that the claim made by Walker may have been a variation of a Republican narrative rather than a factual statement.", "Central part of the plan": "The expert noted that the budget-repair bill included a provision requiring most state and local public employees to pay at least 12 percent of their health insurance premiums. This aspect supports the claim made by Walker, but it does not verify the specific allegation that unions falsely informed their members about the percentage of income required."}
