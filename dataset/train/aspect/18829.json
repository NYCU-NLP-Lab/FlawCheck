{"The claim was made by a satirical website": "The expert's verdict states that the story about the pro-choice activist breaking a world record with her 27th abortion was made up by a satirical website called World News Daily Report. This indicates that the claim is not based on factual information.", "Lack of credibility of the source": "The expert points out that World News Daily Report is a self-described satirical website that includes a disclaimer at the bottom of each page stating that their articles are fictional. This further undermines the authenticity of the claim.", "Inconsistencies and lack of evidence": "The expert highlights several inconsistencies in the story, such as the absence of a byline, the non-existent clinic mentioned in the story, and the use of stock photos from Getty Images. These inconsistencies suggest that the story is fabricated and not based on real events.", "Spread of misinformation": "Despite being a fake story, the claim received over 500,000 interactions on Facebook, indicating that it was widely shared and believed by some users. The fact that it was also shared on YouTube and 4chan without the satirical disclaimer further contributed to the spread of misinformation."}
