{"Testimony from Frank Keating": "Former Oklahoma Governor Frank Keating stated on NBC's Meet the Press that \"In the United States, 50 percent of social services are provided by the Catholic church.\" This statement serves as the initial claim that needs to be verified.", "Lack of corroborating evidence": "Despite efforts to find experts or sources who could confirm or provide information on the statistic, none were found. This lack of external verification raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Extensive Catholic charity work": "It is acknowledged that Catholic charity work is extensive and plays a crucial role in the nation's social safety net. Catholic Charities USA alone has over 2,500 local agencies serving 10 million people annually. Additionally, there are numerous other Catholic-affiliated groups and programs that contribute to charitable efforts.", "Difficulty in quantifying Catholic": "backed charity: The difficulty in quantifying the exact size of Catholic-backed charity is acknowledged. While the expenditure of Catholic Charities USA in 2010 was estimated to be between $4.2 billion and $4.4 billion, it is challenging to determine if this constitutes half of all charitable activity by private groups in the United States. The lack of precise data makes it hard to verify the claim accurately."}
