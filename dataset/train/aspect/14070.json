{"Multiple sources refuted the claim": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim originated from one source only, Thomas Hearns, and was explicitly refuted by Marvelous Marvin Hagler's wife, Kay. This indicates that the claim lacked multiple credible sources to support its authenticity.", "Lack of evidence linking the vaccine to the death": "The expert's verdict highlights that the only mention of the COVID-19 vaccine's involvement in Hagler's death came from Thomas Hearns' Instagram post. However, Hearns did not provide any evidence or specific details to support his claim, making it unsubstantiated.", "Official cause of death stated as natural causes": "Both Kay Hagler's Facebook announcement and the statement on Hagler's website specified that he died of natural causes. This official cause of death contradicts the claim that his death was caused by receiving a COVID-19 vaccination.", "Hagler": "s wife's firsthand knowledge: Kay Hagler, as mentioned in the expert's verdict, was the only person close to Marvin Hagler until his last minute. Her statement that the vaccine did not cause his death carries weight as she had firsthand knowledge of the events leading up to his passing."}
