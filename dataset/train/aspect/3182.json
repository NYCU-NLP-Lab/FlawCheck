{"Trump": "s assertion that foreign governments have a hand in selecting diversity visa recipients is unfounded. The program uses a computer lottery system to randomly issue immigrant visas to qualified applicants from countries with low rates of immigration to the United States. There is no evidence of other countries manipulating the system to offload undesirable residents.", "Green card holders who obtain permanent resident status through the diversity visa program are not automatically granted citizenship": "They must demonstrate \"good moral character,\" pay taxes, avoid criminal activities, learn English, and pass a test on U.S. history and government to become eligible for citizenship.", "Many individuals who come to the U": "S. through the diversity visa program do not become naturalized citizens. This contradicts Trump's claim that the program results in new United States citizens."}
