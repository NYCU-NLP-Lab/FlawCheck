{"The expert mentions that the claim is derived from shoddy image editing of a real photograph from a protest against Donald Trump in Chicago in March 2016": "The original photograph showed a banner that read \"Trump makes America hate, our students make America great\" and had the insignia of the progressive group MoveOn.org and \"Stop Trump Chicago\".", "The expert refers to the fact that the claim was spread through right": "wing websites and Facebook pages such as \"Silence Is Consent\" and \"CultureKill.com\". These platforms are known for promoting hyperpartisan fake news and propaganda.", "The expert highlights that the claim was further modified and circulated in a meme that added the text": "Openly calling for assassination. Guess what comes next...war.\" This modification aimed to further inflame anger and divisiveness.", "The expert provides evidence in the form of several photographs taken at the counterprotest": "showing the same individuals marching with the same banner that was edited in the claim. These photographs confirm the authenticity of the original banner and debunk the claim of protesters calling for Republicans to be assassinated."}
