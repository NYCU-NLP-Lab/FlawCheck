{"The claim alleges that Goodwill used the pandemic to fire all of their employees instead of laying them off": "2. The spokesperson for Goodwill Industries International, Lauren Lawson-Zilai, stated that each Goodwill organization is a locally operated nonprofit with its own president and CEO, implying that the decision to fire employees would be made at the local level.", "Lawson": "Zilai mentioned that more than 96% of Goodwill's thrift stores have closed due to state regulations in response to COVID-19, which could explain the lack of work for employees.", "While some Goodwill organizations have had to furlough their employees": "Lawson-Zilai stated that these employees are receiving benefits that vary by state, indicating that not all employees were fired."}
