{"Lack of evidence": "The expert's verdict states that there is no evidence to support the claim that President Theodore Roosevelt made the quoted statement about angering conservatives and liberals. This lack of evidence casts doubt on the authenticity of the claim.", "Circulation of the quote": "The expert's verdict mentions that the quote has been circulating online for years, with different individuals and groups attributing it to various figures like Winston Churchill and Rush Limbaugh. This widespread circulation without a reliable source raises suspicions about the claim's validity.", "Inconsistency with historical context": "The expert points out that the terms \"liberal\" and \"conservative\" were not commonly used to describe opposing political views during the early 20th century when Roosevelt was active. Instead, the term \"progressive\" was more prevalent. This inconsistency suggests that Roosevelt would not have used the quoted statement, further undermining its authenticity.", "Roosevelt": "s political alignment: The expert mentions that Roosevelt's policies aligned with the agenda of today's Democratic party, despite being a Republican.
