This information was crucial in verifying whether the person in the photo was indeed McMichael.", "Identification of the person in the photo": "The expert identified the person in the photo as James Stachowiak, not Gregory McMichael. They provided evidence from the Council on American-Islamic Relations and the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, which described Stachowiak as a \"violent anti-Muslim extremist\" and someone well-known to law enforcement and civil rights groups.", "Campaign context and response": "The expert provided information about the timing of the photo, which was during Brian Kemp's close race for governor against Stacey Abrams.
