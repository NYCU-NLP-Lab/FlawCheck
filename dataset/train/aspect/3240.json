{"The images used in the claim were found to be misleading and not representative of the actual sources of lithium and fracking sites": "The bottom photo in the montage was identified as the world's largest copper mine, not a lithium mine. The top photo was a stock image of a natural gas drilling rig, not a fracking site specifically related to lithium production.", "The claim incorrectly assumes that environmentalists are hypocritical for using lithium in electric cars while opposing fracking": "However, experts explained that the production of lithium and fracking involve different methods and have different environmental impacts. While both industries have negative effects on the environment, it is difficult to determine which one is more harmful.", "The experts mentioned that the production of lithium using evaporation ponds requires a significant amount of water": "with as much as half a million gallons needed to produce one ton of lithium. They emphasized that the local impacts of lithium production cannot be ignored, even though it is considered a green energy solution to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.", "The claim was found to be circulating on social media platforms during the 2020 US presidential election": "suggesting that it may have been shared for political purposes. The energy and environment have become important issues in the election, with President Donald Trump supporting hydraulic fracturing and fossil fuels, while former Vice President Joe Biden proposes limiting new fracking projects on federal land and transitioning towards cleaner forms of energy."}
