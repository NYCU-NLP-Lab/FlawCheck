{"The GIF image": "The expert mentions that an animated GIF image surfaced, purporting to show President Trump extending his middle finger in an obscene gesture towards Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni. This image is presented as evidence of the claim.", "Video footage": "The expert refers to a video from which the GIF was extracted. The video shows Gentiloni making opening remarks on the second day of the summit. The longer clip of this video contradicts the impression created by the truncated GIF, suggesting that the gesture may not have been intentional.", "News reports and partisan websites": "The expert mentions that partisan websites insinuated that Trump purposely insulted Gentiloni based on news reports of Trump's behavior at the summit. These websites acknowledge that the gesture might not have meant anything at all, highlighting the speculative nature of the claim.", "Historical instances and interpretation": "The expert brings up historical instances where gestures were misinterpreted, such as Mr. Rogers counting on his fingers while singing with children. The expert suggests that considering Trump's behavior during the overseas trip, interpreting his middle finger moment as intentional is not a stretch. However, the expert also emphasizes the lack of concrete evidence to support the claim."}
