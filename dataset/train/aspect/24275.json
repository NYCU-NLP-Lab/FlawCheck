{"Voter records are generally public records": "According to the expert's verdict, voter records are generally public records, except for the information about who someone voted for. This means that a person's voting history, including whether they voted or not, is generally available by request.", "Accessing voting histories varies by state": "The expert mentions that accessing voting histories can be more difficult in some states. For example, in Wisconsin, if you know a voter's full name and date of birth, you can search their voting history on a website maintained by the Wisconsin Elections Commission. However, in other states like Nevada, a date of birth plus either the voter's driver's license number or the last four digits of their Social Security number is required to search online.", "Voter participation may not be instantly recorded": "The expert explains that voter participation is not instantly recorded in some cases. In Wisconsin, for example, local election clerks have up to 45 days to record voter participation. This means that the information may not be immediately available for verification.", "Some states do not allow online search options": "The expert mentions that in at least one state, Alabama, there is no online search option available for accessing voting histories. This means that in such states, alternative methods like making a request to the state election commission or municipal clerk's office may be necessary to obtain the records."}
