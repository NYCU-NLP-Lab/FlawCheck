{"Lack of evidence": "The expert's verdict highlights that there is no evidence to support the claim that Donald Trump was at Ground Zero two days after the 9/11 attack. This suggests that there are no credible sources or records that verify his presence or involvement in the rescue and recovery efforts.", "Contradictory statements": "The expert's verdict mentions that Trump himself made a similar claim on September 11, 2019, stating that he joined support efforts at Ground Zero. However, this claim contradicts the lack of evidence and doubts raised by emergency responders who were present at the time. The contradictory statements raise questions about the authenticity of Trump's claim.", "Viral meme misinformation": "The expert's verdict points out that a viral meme spread widely on Facebook, perpetuating the claim of Trump's presence at Ground Zero. However, the image often used in these memes is not from Ground Zero, further undermining the credibility of the claim. This aspect highlights the role of misinformation and viral content in spreading false information.", "Testimony of emergency responders": "The expert's verdict includes the testimony of Richard Alles, a New York Fire Department battalion chief during 9/11, who stated that he has no knowledge of Trump being at Ground Zero.
