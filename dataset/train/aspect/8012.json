{"The claim is supported by a Facebook post made by Sarah Palin on the anniversary of the passage of the stimulus bill": "where she stated that 80% of the $2 billion spent on alternative energy went to purchase wind turbines built in China. This provides a direct source of the claim.", "The claim is further supported by a link provided in Palin": "s Facebook post to an op-ed in Investor's Business Daily, which states that the Investigative Reporting Workshop at American University found that nearly $2 billion from the stimulus bill has been spent on wind power, with 80% of that going to foreign manufacturers of wind turbines. This provides additional evidence from a reputable news source.", "The Investigative Reporting Workshop published an analysis in October 2009": "which found that of the $1.05 billion in clean-energy grants already handed out by the Department of Energy, about 84% ended up in the hands of foreign wind companies. This analysis confirms the claim that a significant portion of the stimulus funds allocated for alternative energy went to foreign manufacturers.", "The report from the Investigative Reporting Workshop also states that these grants are given to U": "S.-based wind projects, but many of these projects are being built by the American subsidiaries of foreign-owned companies. This indicates that while the projects may be based in the U.S., the funds are ultimately benefiting foreign manufacturers."}
