{"Lack of evidence in the last 20 years": "The expert's verdict highlights that there is no real evidence in the last 20 years to support the claim that growth from tax cuts has made up for lost revenue. This suggests that historical data does not support the idea that tax cuts alone can fully offset the revenue loss.", "Other ways to offset tax cuts": "The expert mentions that there are alternative methods to offset tax cuts, such as raising rates on other taxes, limiting tax breaks, cutting spending, or using a combination of these approaches. This indicates that relying solely on economic growth to cover lost revenue is not the only option.", "Unclear specifics on paying for the cuts": "The expert notes that the Trump administration has not provided specific details on how they plan to pay for the tax cuts. This lack of clarity raises doubts about the claim's authenticity, as there is no concrete plan to address the potential revenue loss.", "Doubts about the feasibility of economic growth": "Most experts agree that the level of economic growth needed to fully offset the revenue loss from tax cuts is not realistic. One economist even suggests that steep tax cuts may hinder economic growth. This skepticism further questions the claim's validity and the assumption that tax cuts alone can generate sufficient growth."}
