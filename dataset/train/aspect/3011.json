{"Reverse image searches": "The expert used reverse image searches to verify the authenticity of the viral photos. This technique allowed them to find the original sources of the images and determine that they were old and unrelated to the current group of immigrants.", "Corroborating information": "The expert found corroborating information about one of the photos from a 2012 news story, which reported a clash between student-protesters and police in the Mexican state of Michoac\u00e1n. This information helped confirm that the photo was not related to the Central American immigrants.", "News reports": "The expert referenced news reports from 2011 and 2014 that featured two of the viral photos. These reports described clashes between teachers and police in Mexico's Oaxaca state and between protesters and police in Chilpancingo. By citing these reports, the expert established that the photos had been taken in different contexts and were not connected to the current situation.", "Eyewitness accounts and video evidence": "The expert mentioned video footage from an ABC News report that showed a confrontation between the Central American immigrants and Mexican police. This footage confirmed that the immigrants threw objects at the police and that tear gas was used, supporting the claim that there was a confrontation. However, it also highlighted the difference between the actual events and the misleading photos being circulated."}
