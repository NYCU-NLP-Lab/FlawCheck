{"The timing of the report": "The expert's verdict highlights that the report claiming Shaheen Bagh to be empty was published in the early hours of Tuesday, suggesting that it may not accurately reflect the situation later in the day.", "Verification from multiple sources": "The expert mentions that the report was picked up by right-wing website OpIndia and shared by BJP IT cell head Amit Malviya. This suggests that the claim was not independently verified and may have a biased perspective.", "Contradicting evidence": "The expert presents evidence from The Quint's Akanksha Kumar, who reported that the picture used in the report was taken before the protesters started pouring in. This contradicts the claim that Shaheen Bagh was empty.", "Timeline of events": "The expert provides a timeline of events at Shaheen Bagh on Tuesday, indicating that the protesters did show up and continued their demonstration throughout the day.
