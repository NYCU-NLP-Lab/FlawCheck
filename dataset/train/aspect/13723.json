{"Comparison of the claim with the original image": "The expert compared the claim that the photograph shows an Antifa member hitting a police officer with the original image taken in Athens, Greece in December 2009. By analyzing the two images side by side, the expert was able to verify that the claim was false.", "Analysis of the image source": "The expert investigated the source of the image and found that it was taken by photographer Milos Bicanski during a demonstration in Athens, Greece. The expert also discovered that the original image did not have the Antifa logo on the protester's jacket, indicating that it was digitally added to the image to support the false claim.", "Examination of the image context": "The expert provided information about the context in which the original image was taken, explaining that it was captured during a demonstration commemorating the death of Alexandros Grigoropoulos, a 15-year-old who was killed by a police officer. This context further debunked the claim that the image depicted an Antifa member hitting a police officer during the Charlottesville incident.", "Evaluation of political responses": "The expert mentioned the responses of politicians, including President Trump, to the Charlottesville incident. By highlighting the denouncement of white supremacy and violence by several politicians, the expert indirectly refuted the claim that Democrats had not denounced Antifa protestors, as suggested in the circulated image."}
