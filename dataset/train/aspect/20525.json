{"The claim was verified by conducting a search on Google with the keywords": "1212 pillars Rameshwaram temple', which led to the discovery that the Ramanathaswamy temple in Rameshwaram, Tamil Nadu, does have an outer corridor with 1212 pillars. This information was found on the temple's official website, confirming the claim to be partially correct.", "The authenticity of the claim was further questioned when it was observed that the photograph shared with the claim did not resemble the Rameshwaram temple": "To determine the origin of the photograph, a reverse-image search was conducted, which revealed that the photo is actually of Hoshang Shah's tomb in Mandu, Madhya Pradesh. This discrepancy raised doubts about the accuracy of the claim.", "The expert also noted that the claim has been circulating on social media for several years": "with similar posts dating back to 2016. This suggests that the claim has been widely shared without proper verification, potentially contributing to its misleading nature.", "Additionally": "the expert mentioned that the person who initially shared the claim on social media, S. Gurumurthy, is a part-time director of the RBI (Reserve Bank of India). While this may not directly impact the authenticity of the claim, it raises questions about the credibility and expertise of the source."}
