{"The timing of the post": "The expert noted that the post was entered into Facebook on February 22, 2019, which was the same day Indonesian authorities announced the MotoGP race on Lombok island for 2021. This suggests a possible connection between the announcement and the post.", "Misleading caption and reference": "The misleading post included an image of an aerial view of a motorsport track and a caption that translated to English as a confirmation of Indonesia being named as a MotoGP host in 2021. The caption also referenced Prabowo Subianto, a presidential candidate in Indonesia's election. This indicates an attempt to associate the event with a political agenda.", "Discrepancy in the image source": "The expert discovered that the image used in the post was not of the Indonesian circuit but of the Sepang circuit in Malaysia. This was confirmed through a Google Reverse Image search and by comparing it to the picture available on MotoGP's official website. The use of an unrelated image raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "AFP report confirmation": "The expert mentioned that AFP (Agence France-Presse) had reported on the MotoGP hosting announcement, specifically mentioning the Mandalika circuit in West Nusa Tenggara province as the planned location. This report supports the claim that an Indonesian circuit will host the MotoGP race in 2021 and adds credibility to the expert's verdict."}
