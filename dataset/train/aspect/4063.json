{"The claim was verified by referencing a policy brief from the Brookings Institution": "a reputable think tank. The brief, authored by Darrell West, provided information on the percentage of skilled workers in the United States immigration system compared to other countries like Canada.", "The expert contacted": "Darrell West, confirmed that his figure of 6.5 percent was an approximation based on conflicting numbers and different immigrant categories. This verification aspect demonstrates that the expert's figure was not an exact measurement but the best approximation available.", "The expert also explained that the U": "S. Department of Homeland Security publishes numbers on legal permanent residents, which include both skilled and unskilled workers. This aspect highlights the complexity of categorizing immigrants based on skill levels and the challenges in obtaining precise data.", "The fact": "checkers independently analyzed the numbers themselves and found that the majority of immigrants accepted into the United States were for family unification purposes, while a smaller portion were accepted for employment. This aspect reinforces the claim's assertion that only a small percentage of immigrants come to the U.S. based on labor and skill."}
