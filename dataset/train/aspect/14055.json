{"Biden misspoke during the CNN town hall when he said": "It\u2019s one thing to have the vaccine, which we didn\u2019t have when we came into office.\" This statement was false, as there were 50 million vaccine doses available when he took office.", "Biden": "s remarks during the town hall indicate that he did not claim there was no vaccine at all at the beginning of his term. He acknowledged the availability of vaccine doses just minutes before making the false statement.", "Kayleigh McEnany": "Trump's former press secretary, tweeted that Biden falsely claimed a vaccine did not exist when he began his term. The video segment shared by McEnany did include authentic comments by Biden, where he stated that his administration did not have \"the vaccine\" when they took over the White House.", "However": "based on other comments made by Biden during the event and an email correspondence with the White House, it was misleading to claim that Biden erroneously attempted to deny the existence of any vaccine at the beginning of his term. The intention behind his phrasing in that brief moment was clarified, suggesting a misstatement rather than a deliberate claim of non-existence."}
