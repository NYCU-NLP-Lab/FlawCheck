{"Confirmation from NASA spokesperson": "The claim is supported by the statement of Trish Chamberson, an official spokesperson from NASA, who confirmed the existence of extraterrestrial life and their visits to Earth for thousands of years.", "Allegations about the Greys and ancient structures": "Chamberson made sensational allegations during the interview, suggesting that the alien species known as the Greys have been visiting Earth for thousands of years and may have been involved in the construction of ancient structures like the pyramids of Giza.", "Mention of alien mining operations": "Chamberson also confirmed theories about alien mining operations in the solar system, including the presence of a mine on the far side of the Moon and the assessment of various planets for minerals. She even claimed that aliens have recently started mining Jupiter, resulting in the appearance of new rings around the gas giant.", "Apology and admission of forgetfulness": "The satirical nature of the claim was revealed when it was traced back to an article published by Waterford Whispers. Another scientist apologized for the mix-up, explaining that they had forgotten to officially disclose the information about aliens due to being busy with back-engineering their technology and their presence on the far side of the Moon. The scientist also mentioned the aliens' concerns about the impact of nuclear weapons on parallel universes."}
