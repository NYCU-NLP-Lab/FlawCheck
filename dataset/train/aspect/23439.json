{"Comparison of statistics": "The expert compared the statistics provided by the Department of Homeland Security for seizures by U.S. Customs and Border Protection and Immigration Customs Enforcement under the Obama administration and the previous administration of President George W. Bush. This comparison included the growth in illegal currency seizures, illegal drug seizures, and illegal weapons seizures.", "Government Accountability Office report": "The expert referenced a report issued by the Government Accountability Office (GAO), which is a nonpartisan investigative arm of the U.S. Congress. The report focused on the federal government's effort to stop cross-border currency smuggling and provided data on cash seizures. The expert highlighted the increase in cash seizures after the implementation of a program to boost seizures of outbound money and drugs.", "Wide variation in cash seizures": "The expert pointed out that cash seizures varied widely, ranging from about $1 million to $8 million per month. This information suggests that the reported seizures by Customs and Border Protection may only account for a fraction of the money that crosses the borders.", "Estimation of smuggling amounts": "The expert mentioned an estimated range of $18 billion to $39 billion being smuggled out of the southwest border each year, according to the GAO report. This estimation provides additional context to assess the claim about the historic highs of contraband seizures."}
