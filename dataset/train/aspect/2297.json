{"PETA": "s investigation: PETA conducted an investigation into the production of coconut milk in Thailand and reported that monkeys were used in the process and subjected to cruelty, including being taken away from their families, chained, and confined. This investigation supports the claim of mistreatment of monkeys.", "Costco": "s response: While Costco has not publicly confirmed the reason for stopping the sale of Chaokoh coconut milk, PETA made public a letter from a Costco executive stating that the company has temporarily ceased purchasing the brand until they can be assured that monkeys are not involved in its production. This response suggests that Costco took the allegations seriously and acted accordingly."}
