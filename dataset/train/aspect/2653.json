{"The discovery of the endocannabinoid system": "The expert highlights the significant development in understanding the endocannabinoid system, which was only discovered in the 1990s. This system consists of specific receptors affected by chemicals already present in the body, including endocannabinoids and phytocannabinoids from cannabis.", "The role of cannabidiol": "CBD): The expert discusses the therapeutic potential of CBD, a phytocannabinoid found in cannabis. Studies suggest that CBD has strong pain-relieving and anti-inflammatory properties, and it has been shown to halt seizures caused by Dravet's Syndrome. Additionally, a 2008 paper suggests that CBD may inhibit bone resorption through its interaction with the GPR55 receptor.", "The psychoactive effects of tetrahydrocannabinol": "THC): The expert mentions THC, another phytocannabinoid in cannabis, which produces the psychoactive \"high\" sought by recreational users. However, the expert also notes that THC has the opposite effect on the GPR55 receptor compared to CBD, potentially negating the positive effects on bone density caused by CBD.", "The need for further research": "The expert acknowledges that while CBD shows promise in promoting bone health, it remains to be determined whether cannabis smoking, which contains both CBD and THC, may increase bone density. The expert suggests that more studies are required to fully understand the effects of cannabis on bone turnover and density."}
