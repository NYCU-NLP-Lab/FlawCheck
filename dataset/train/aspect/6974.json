{"Analysis of crime data": "The expert analyzed the crime data in Germany to determine the level of crime and its relationship to migration. They found that Germany's crime rate, particularly violent crime, is lower than in the United States, contradicting Trump's claim.", "Examination of government studies": "The expert mentioned that the German government has repeatedly studied the question of crime and migrants. They referred to the Bundeskriminalamt's data, which showed a 79 percent increase in crimes by immigrants in 2015. This study provided evidence to verify the claim.", "Comparison of crime rates between Germans and migrants": "The expert highlighted that the increase in crime was primarily driven by the German population, rather than migrants. They stated that the typical German was more likely to engage in crime than the average migrant, contradicting the claim that Germany is \"crime-riddled\" due to migration.", "Evaluation of specific crime categories": "The expert mentioned that most crimes committed by refugees in Germany were related to theft or public transport violations, with a small percentage being sex crimes. They also acknowledged the concern over sexual assaults by North African migrants, but emphasized that such incidents were not representative of the majority of crimes committed by refugees. This analysis provided additional context to assess the claim's authenticity."}
