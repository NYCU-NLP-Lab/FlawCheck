{"Reference to a tragic historical event": "The expert's verdict mentions an anecdote about a vaccination given to prevent miscarriages that resulted in tragic consequences. This historical event is used to support the claim that vaccines can have long-term consequences and therefore more research is needed.", "Inaccurate information about animal research": "The expert's claim that there hasn't been any animal research on the COVID-19 vaccines is proven to be false. The expert's lack of knowledge on this aspect undermines the credibility of their argument.", "Comparison of vaccine development timelines": "The expert argues that it is unrealistic to develop a safe vaccine in less than a year based on the historical timeline of vaccine development. The verdict counters this claim by highlighting the unprecedented global cooperation and accelerated clinical trials that led to the development of COVID-19 vaccines in a shorter time frame.", "Evidence of millions of safely vaccinated individuals": "The expert's claim is challenged by the fact that millions of Americans have already been safely vaccinated. This evidence contradicts the notion that vaccines cannot be developed safely in a shorter time period."}
