{"Historical evidence": "The expert likely examined historical records, such as diaries and accounts from the Dutch settlers, to verify their presence in South Africa before black people.", "Colonial establishment": "The Dutch East India Company's establishment of a settlement in Cape Town and their interactions with the Khoikhoi people, as documented by Jan van Riebeeck, provide evidence of the Dutch presence in South Africa.", "Conflicts with indigenous populations": "The expert may have analyzed the conflicts between the Dutch settlers and the Xhosa people, which occurred in the late 1700s and resulted in the defeat of the Xhosa. These conflicts indicate the Dutch settlers' occupation and control of the land.", "Apartheid era classification": "The expert might have considered the racial classification system used during the apartheid period in South Africa, which recognized both \"colored\" and \"black\" groups. This classification system further supports the claim that the Dutch were present in South Africa before black people."}
