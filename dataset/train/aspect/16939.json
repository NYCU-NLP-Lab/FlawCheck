{"The claim is supported by a tweet from Mahlon Mitchell": "president of the state firefighters union, where he explicitly states, \"When @ScottWalker told firefighters we didn\u2019t need to worry about Act 10, we said hell no, we stand with working Wisconsinites everywhere.\" This tweet serves as primary evidence for the claim.", "The claim is further supported by the fact that Act 10": "which limited collective bargaining for public employee unions, exempted police and firefighters unions from the changes. This exemption suggests that firefighters were not affected by Act 10 and supports Mitchell's claim of standing with working Wisconsinites.", "The claim is backed by Mitchell": "s involvement in the Madison protests against Act 10. Mitchell was a prominent figure in the protests and led firefighters in and around the Capitol. This involvement provides additional evidence for his statement of standing against Act 10.", "Mitchell": "s previous statements and actions also support the claim. While Mitchell issued a statement praising Gov. Walker's recognition of the critical work done by firefighters, it was issued before he protested Act 10. This contradiction suggests a change in stance and supports the claim that Mitchell and the firefighters union opposed Act 10."}
