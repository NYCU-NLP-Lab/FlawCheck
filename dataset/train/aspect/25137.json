{"The claim is based on Broun": "s vote against a resolution to prohibit the sale of \"crush videos,\" which typically depict animal cruelty and are considered a sexual fetish by some.", "Broun himself condemned the videos": "calling them \"morally reprehensible,\" indicating that he does not support their sale.", "Bob Barr": "a former congressman and U.S. attorney, also voted against a similar law in 1999 and cited reasons similar to Broun's for his opposition.", "The accusation that Broun": "supports\" the sale of the videos is deemed false, as voting against the resolution on constitutional grounds is not equivalent to supporting the sale of deviant material."}
