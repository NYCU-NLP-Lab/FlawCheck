{"Lack of prior mention or evidence": "The expert's verdict highlights that there is no record or mention of a reality show called \"Jack Sparrow House\" prior to the viral tweet. This absence of any previous information or evidence raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Absence from official lists": "The expert's investigation involved examining official lists of programs on Quibi, and \"Jack Sparrow House\" did not appear on any of these lists. This further undermines the credibility of the claim.", "Inaccurate image source": "The image provided as evidence of the show's cast members was proven to be unrelated. It was actually a picture of Captain Jack Sparrow fans at the premiere of a movie in Tokyo. This discrepancy in the image source contradicts the claim and suggests it is fabricated.", "Attribution to a comedian": "The expert identifies comedian Rory Strahan-Mauk as the likely creator of the fake Wikipedia page and the pitch for the Captain Jack Sparrow-based reality TV show. This attribution to a known comedian adds weight to the conclusion that the claim is not genuine."}
