{"Lack of scientific evidence": "The expert states that there is no scientific evidence to support the claim that drinking apple juice can increase penis size. They emphasize that nothing a person eats or drinks can affect the size of their penis, unless they undergo surgery.", "Satirical and unscientific sources": "The expert points out that the only evidence found on the internet in favor of the claim consists of a satirical article published on a humor website and an unscientific piece of generic website copy written by a self-declared expert on penis enlargement. These sources do not provide credible or reliable information.", "Spike in Google searches": "The expert mentions a massive spike in two related Google searches - \"how to make pp bigger\" and \"does apple juice make pp bigger\" - in June 2020. They explain that this trend was influenced by internet personality PewDiePie and his fans using \"pp\" as an inside joke. This spike in searches does not provide substantial evidence for the claim.", "Viral video and meme creator": "The expert reveals that the spike in searches was a reaction to a viral video uploaded by a meme creator named \"IGotSilver.\" The video, titled \"Does Size Matter?\", featured footage of a man asking pornographic actresses about their views on penis size. The video ended with the man chugging apple juice after searching \"how to make pp bigger\" on Google. This connection between the viral video and the apple juice claim suggests that the claim may have originated from a meme and not from any legitimate scientific basis."}
