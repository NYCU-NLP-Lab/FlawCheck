{"The claim states that wearing masks decreases oxygen intake": "The expert's verdict counters this by stating that there is no evidence to support this claim. In fact, the expert explains that there is no decreased oxygen or increased carbon dioxide from normal breathing while wearing a mask.", "The claim suggests that wearing masks increases toxin inhalation": "The expert's verdict dismisses this claim, stating that there is no reason to worry about toxins being trapped in the mask and re-inhaled into the lungs. The only potentially toxic molecule that is routinely exhaled is carbon dioxide, which easily passes through the mask.", "The claim asserts that wearing masks shuts down the immune system": "The expert's verdict refutes this, stating that there is no evidence to support the claim that masks have any effect on the immune system or immune function.", "The claim argues that wearing masks increases the risk of the virus": "However, the expert's verdict contradicts this by explaining that health officials largely agree that wearing any kind of face mask, along with social distancing and frequent hand-washing, is more protective than going unmasked. Additionally, studies have shown that masks can curb the spread of the novel coronavirus."}
