These additional social media posts help in establishing the widespread circulation of the claim.", "Previous media reports": "The expert refers to a report by The Guardian from September 2019, which included sections of the viral video in their coverage of flooding in Patna and mentioned the submerged condition of one of the big hospitals, specifically Nalanda Medical College and Hospital. The expert also mentions a report by Times of India from the same period, which carried an image of the flooded ward at NMCH. These media reports provide historical context and support the authenticity of the claim.", "Clarification of timing": "The expert clarifies that the video being shared does not represent the present situation of Nalanda Medical College and Hospital.
