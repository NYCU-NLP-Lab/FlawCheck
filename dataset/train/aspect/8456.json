{"Analysis of the video footage": "The expert likely examined the YouTube video that claimed Joe Biden faked an interview in front of a green screen. They would have analyzed the specific moments in the video where Biden's hands appear to move in front of the microphones, assessing whether it was evidence of a green screen or if there could be another explanation.", "Verification of eyewitness accounts": "The expert considered the testimony of Steve Herman, a reporter who was present during the interview and held one of the microphones. Herman's statement that he was physically in front of Biden on the South Lawn and that the interview was real would have been taken into account as a reliable eyewitness account.", "Evaluation of additional images": "The expert examined other images from the same day that showed Biden, the microphones, and reporters from different angles. These images would have provided additional evidence to verify the authenticity of the claim, as they would show consistent positioning and interaction between Biden, the microphones, and the reporters.", "Reference to an expert": "s analysis: The expert referred to Mick West, who specializes in debunking conspiracy theories. West created a video explaining that the illusion of something amiss in the video was due to the long booms on the microphones, which create a visual effect. The expert likely considered West's analysis as supporting evidence to counter the claim of a green screen."}
