{"Collage of multiple photographs": "The expert's verdict mentions that a collage of multiple photographs was circulated on social media to portray the Indian government's brutality in Kashmir. This collage is one of the main aspects that were employed to verify the authenticity of the claim.", "Hashtags and social media sharing": "The claim was shared on social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook using hashtags such as #28DaysOfKashmirShutdown, #KashmirBleedsUNSleeps, and #KashmirUnderThreat. The expert's verdict highlights the use of these hashtags and the sharing of the claim on Facebook as additional aspects used to verify its authenticity.", "Fact": "checking of images: The expert's verdict mentions that a fact-check of the images in the collage revealed that they are old and unrelated to recent events in Kashmir. The expert found one image in a 2018 blog post, another in a magazine from 2015, a third image from 2017, and a fourth image from 2016. This process of fact-checking the images is an important aspect employed to verify the authenticity of the claim.", "Previous instances of the images": "The expert's verdict also mentions that some of the images in the collage have been found in previous instances, such as a 2010 blog post and a 2004 Shutterstock upload. The fact that these images have been used in different contexts and timeframes raises doubts about their relevance to the current situation in Kashmir. Therefore, the identification of previous instances of the images is another aspect used to verify the authenticity of the claim."}
