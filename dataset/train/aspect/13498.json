{"Lack of credible reports": "The expert's verdict highlights that the San Angelo police had not received any reports of human trafficking, kidnappings, or attempted kidnappings relating to human trafficking. This lack of credible reports undermines the authenticity of the claim.", "Debunking by authorities": "The San Angelo police quickly debunked the claim and released a statement stating that they had not received any reports of black zip ties being used to mark potential targets of any crime. This debunking by authorities adds to the evidence against the claim's authenticity.", "Origin of the claim": "The expert's verdict mentions that one of the women who made the original social media post had simply copied and pasted the photograph and warning as a means to alert women about human trafficking. This suggests that the claim might have originated from a well-intentioned but misinformed source, further questioning its authenticity.", "Lack of logical reasoning": "The expert points out that the claim makes no sense given modern technology. If traffickers were working in teams, they could easily communicate via cellphones to identify the victim's location, rendering the use of zip ties or any other item as a marker unnecessary. This lack of logical reasoning casts doubt on the credibility of the claim."}
