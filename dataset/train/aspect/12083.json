{"Counterfeit website posing as US Weekly": "The first aspect employed to verify the authenticity of the claim was the identification of a counterfeit website, gainestylist.com, which was designed to mimic the appearance of the legitimate news outlet US Weekly. This raised suspicions about the credibility of the article.", "Fabricated story leading to an advertisement": "The article in question contained a fabricated story about Kelly Clarkson being fired from \"The Voice,\" but it quickly transitioned into promoting an over-the-counter natural supplement. This diversion from the initial claim indicated that the article was not a genuine news report but rather a deceptive tactic to promote a product.", "Lack of official confirmation or comment": "The expert's verdict highlighted that there was no official confirmation or comment from NBC regarding Kelly Clarkson's alleged firing. This absence of any official statement cast doubt on the claim's authenticity and suggested that it might be a false rumor.", "Clarkson": "s response and clarification: Kelly Clarkson herself addressed the claim in an interview with Ellen, where she denied taking drugs and explained that the pills she was seen taking on set were Keto, an over-the-counter natural supplement for weight loss. Her response contradicted the claim made in the counterfeit article and provided evidence against its authenticity."}
