{"The reverse search of the image": "The expert used a simple reverse search of the image shared on social media and found the original source. This helped establish that the image was photoshopped and not authentic.", "Comparison with the original image": "The expert compared the photoshopped image with the original image that appeared in an article in The Star in June 2009. This comparison clearly showed that the family in the image was watching a speech by Barack Obama, not Imran Khan.", "Creation date of the Twitter handle": "The expert noted that the Twitter handle @saira_muslim was created recently in September 2019. This raised suspicions about the authenticity of the claim, as the handle had a low following and the tweet had been retweeted multiple times.", "Circulation by social media users from Pakistan": "The expert found that the image and claim were also circulated by several social media users and handles from Pakistan. This suggests a possible motive for spreading false information or propaganda."}
