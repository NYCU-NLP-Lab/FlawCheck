{"The CDC": "s methodology for estimating flu deaths: The expert mentions that the CDC uses mathematical estimates to retroactively measure the burden of each flu season. They describe the model used, which involves a ratio of deaths-to-hospitalizations to estimate the total influenza-associated deaths.", "Investigation of death certificates": "After each flu season, the CDC considers in-hospital death data and investigates death certificates to account for the total flu deaths. This process helps estimate how likely deaths are to occur outside the hospital, as not all deaths related to influenza happen within a healthcare facility.", "Refutation of Candace Owens": "statistics: The expert states that none of the statistics presented by Candace Owens in her claim are correct, according to CDC data. This indicates that the CDC has verified and refuted the information provided by Owens.", "Flu season timeline and variation": "The expert mentions that flu seasons vary from year to year and don't have a strict timeline. They explain that flu activity typically peaks between December and February in the United States but can last as late as May. This information highlights the variability and duration of flu seasons, providing context for understanding the claim being evaluated."}
