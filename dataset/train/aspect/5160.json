{"Inconsistent and unreliable source": "The expert's verdict highlights that the claim was published on a website called NewsPunch, which is known for publishing misinformation and has a reputation for shoddy journalistic practices. This raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Misleading and unrelated photographs": "The article accompanying the claim used unrelated photographs, including one taken during the 2002 D.C. sniper attack. This discrepancy suggests that the website may have used misleading visuals to support their false narrative.", "Logical errors and inconsistencies": "The article described Gibson being killed in his Jeep, while the photograph showed a dead body on a bench. This inconsistency in the details casts doubt on the accuracy of the claim and suggests a lack of factual verification.", "Lack of evidence and corroboration": "The expert's investigation failed to find any mention of a boxing promoter named Barry Gibson working with Mayweather Productions or any other reputable source. Additionally, the supposed article from The Washington Post about Gibson's death was found to be doctored, with no record of its existence. The absence of corroborating evidence undermines the credibility of the claim."}
