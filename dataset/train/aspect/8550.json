{"The historical documentation": "The expert refers to historical records and news reports from November 1925 that mention the daredevils' aerial acrobatics and the attempt to play tennis on the wings of a plane. This provides evidence of the event taking place.", "Eyewitness accounts": "The expert mentions that Gladys Roy and Ivan Unger were known \"wing walkers\" or \"barnstormers\" who frequently performed stunts at state fair events. While there is skepticism about whether they actually played a game of tennis, these eyewitness accounts establish their credibility as performers.", "Analysis of the physics involved": "The expert discusses the physics of hitting a ball back and forth on the wings of a plane, highlighting the difficulties and questioning the feasibility of playing a proper game of tennis in such conditions. This analysis adds to the evaluation of the claim's authenticity.", "Comparison of multiple photographs": "The expert mentions a second photograph available via Getty Images that shows the daredevils in slightly different positions, with no tennis ball visible in either picture. By comparing these photographs, the expert further supports the notion that the tennis game may have been staged, but the overall stunt was real."}
