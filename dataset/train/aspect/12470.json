{"The expert cited a study conducted by the International Food Policy Research Institute that showed a specific payback tied to foreign aid for agricultural research": "This study indicated that every $1 invested in agriculture research would bring $4 in trade with the countries and the United States, generating employment back in the U.S.", "The expert also referred to a 1996 article that described a domino effect resulting from agricultural research": "This article stated that higher production from research leads to economic growth and increased income, which in turn generates demand for more imports. It mentioned that when accounting for the flow of additional imports over time, a $1 investment in agricultural research generates $4.39 of additional imports.", "However": "the article also noted that there is no guarantee that a particular donor country, such as the United States, will capture the gains from the increase in exports. This means that while the investment may spur $4 in trade, it does not necessarily mean that American companies will benefit from it.", "The expert": "s office cited a 2006 analysis from the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research, which aimed to measure the economic impact of funded research. While this analysis did find that research boosted trade, it did not provide strong support for the expert's case due to various reasons."}
