Jack Kingston, who made the claim, and U.S. House Speaker John Boehner. This indicates that the claim was based on a specific time period, distinguishing it from Boehner's statement.", "Gallup poll data": "Kingston's office cited a nationwide Gallup poll on America's uninsured to support the claim. The poll showed a slightly higher percentage of uninsured Americans currently compared to the first quarter of 2009. However, the margin of error was mentioned, suggesting some uncertainty in the data."}
