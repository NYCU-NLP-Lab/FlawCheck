{"The expert": "s analysis of historical events: The expert refers to the negotiations between President Reagan and House Speaker O'Neill in 1983, highlighting significant changes made to Social Security, one of the government's \"mandatory\" spending programs. This historical context is employed to support the claim that a large portion of the federal budget is permanently appropriated.", "Reference to specific government programs": "The expert mentions Obamacare, Medicare, and Social Security as examples of programs that fall under the category of mandatory spending. By identifying these specific programs, the expert provides concrete evidence to support the claim that two-thirds of the federal budget is permanently appropriated.", "Categorization of federal spending": "The expert breaks down federal spending into three broad categories - discretionary spending, mandatory spending, and net interest paid on the federal debt. By categorizing the spending, the expert provides a framework to analyze the claim and assess the proportion of the budget that is permanently appropriated.", "Explanation of permanent or multi": "year appropriations: The expert explains that unlike discretionary spending, which requires annual appropriations from Congress, mandatory spending is typically provided in permanent or multi-year appropriations. This explanation supports the claim that a significant portion of the federal budget is permanently appropriated, as it highlights the automatic availability of funding for mandatory programs each year, without further legislative action."}
