The warning message was found to be a type of internet hoax known as \"copypasta,\" which involves the repeated copying and pasting of a block of text on various online platforms.", "The warning lacked specific details such as dates and locations for the alleged threat of violence": "making it vague and unsubstantiated.", "The timing of the hoax coincided with racial justice protests and reports of Black men found hanging from trees": "which heightened concerns and fears related to racial violence."}
