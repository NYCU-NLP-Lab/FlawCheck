{"Biden misspoke during the interview and initially claimed that his plan to send every qualified person to a four": "year college in their state would cost $150 billion.", "The Biden campaign later clarified that the actual cost of the free public college plan would be double that amount": "amounting to $300 billion over 10 years, after factoring in projected gains in tax revenue.", "A Georgetown study analyzed the financial effects of the proposal and estimated that the plan would cost federal and state governments": "683.1 billion over an 11-year period, while generating an additional $371.4 billion in tax revenue.", "The Biden campaign based their estimate on the variables considered in the College for All Act of 2017": "which aimed to make public colleges and universities tuition-free for families with incomes below $125,000, and projected that increasing the number of college graduates would lead to higher earnings in the labor market and generate substantial tax revenue."}
