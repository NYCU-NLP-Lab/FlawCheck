{"Introduction of amendments": "The expert's verdict mentions that U.S. Rep. Tammy Baldwin introduced amendments on the matter of Coast Guard engines three different times. This indicates her effort to address the issue and supports her claim.", "Focus on Wisconsin": "based company: The first amendment introduced by Baldwin aimed to prohibit the purchase of new Coast Guard cutters unless their engines were made in the United States by a domestically operated entity. The expert's verdict notes that this would have benefited Wisconsin-based Fairbanks Morse Engine, located in Baldwin's district. This aspect highlights her focus on supporting a specific Wisconsin company.", "Lack of major political battles": "The expert's verdict mentions that there were no major political battles over Coast Guard engines during Baldwin's nearly 14 years in Congress. This suggests that the issue may not have been as significant or widely debated as Baldwin's claim implies.", "No evidence of successful requirement": "The expert's verdict states that there is no evidence to suggest that Baldwin's fight to require the Coast Guard to buy engines from Wisconsin manufacturers was successful or that such a requirement is currently in place. This raises doubts about the authenticity of her claim and questions the impact of her efforts."}
