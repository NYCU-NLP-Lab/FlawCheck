{"The claim made by the individual driving efforts to fund and build a wall at the southern border is that New Mexico is providing public benefits to immigrants in the country illegally": "specifically stating that they receive emergency welfare EBT cards with $1,000 per month, plus $200 for each child, for at least five years until they see a judge.", "Jodi McGinnis Porter": "a spokesperson for the New Mexico Human Services Department, denies the accuracy of the claim, stating that none of the tweets made by the individual are accurate. She asserts that New Mexico is fully compliant with federal regulations and only provides benefits to qualified recipients.", "The individual supporting the claim": "however, argues that his information is based on what Border Patrol agents have told him. He claims that the benefits, referred to as emergency welfare, bypass all rules and are provided for five to six years due to the immigration backlog on court cases. He also mentions that if an immigrant sees an immigration judge within a month, they would only receive benefits for that one month.", "The claim is partially supported by an April Breitbart post by Kris Kobach": "which states that U.S. law allows those who obtain asylum to qualify for federal welfare benefits. Kobach's post suggests that many asylum applicants may also be receiving these benefits, and it appears that immigrants paroled into the country are getting EBT cards before their eligibility period. However, the post does not specifically mention New Mexico or provide data to support the claim."}
