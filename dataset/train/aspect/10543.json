{"The claim originated from an April Fools": "Day post made on the blog of activist group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) in 2013.", "The original post was tongue": "in-cheek and laden with puns, indicating it was meant as a joke rather than a serious claim.", "The claim misinterprets a scientific discovery about Lone Star Ticks potentially causing a rare meat allergy in specific cases": "which was reported by NPR in late 2012.", "The government has not issued health warnings about meat allergies associated with these ticks": "and such allergies are still quite rare, affecting about 1,500 people since it was first reported in 2008 compared to the roughly 25,000 new cases of Lyme disease reported every year."}
