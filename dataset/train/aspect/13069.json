{"The expert used ProPublica": "s Represent app to track and compare the voting records of Rep. Justin Amash, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, and Speaker Nancy Pelosi. This app provided a comprehensive database of voting records from the 112th to the current Congress.", "The expert found that Rep": "Amash has voted against his party more than any other House member in the current session, with a dissent rate of 32.6%. However, he has agreed with McCarthy for 65% of the roll call votes, indicating a significant level of alignment with the Republican Party.", "The comparison between Amash and Pelosi couldn": "t be made for this session due to Pelosi's role as the Speaker of the House. Speakers traditionally do not vote regularly, and Pelosi has missed nearly nine out of ten votes. Therefore, ProPublica does not have a page to compare Pelosi's voting record with other representatives.", "Despite the lack of direct comparison between Amash and Pelosi": "s voting records, it is noted that Pelosi consistently supports her party's legislative agenda, at least rhetorically. This suggests that Amash may align more with Pelosi's party on policy matters, even if their voting records cannot be directly compared."}
