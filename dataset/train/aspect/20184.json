This information suggests that the claim of one-third of Biden's appointees being immigrants or children of immigrants could be plausible.", "Unproven rating": "Due to the lack of relevant details and an official list, the fact-checker issues a rating of \"Unproven\" for the claim. This indicates that they were unable to reach a definitive determination on the accuracy of Raghavan's claim."}
