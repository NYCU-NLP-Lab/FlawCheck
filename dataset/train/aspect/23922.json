{"The claim made by President Donald Trump is that almost 100 percent of the land once controlled by ISIS in Syria and Iraq has been retaken": "and this occurred since his election.", "The State Department": "s senior envoy to the anti-Islamic State coalition stated in December that only half of the ISIS caliphate was recaptured under Trump's leadership.", "According to the U": "S-led coalition, 98 percent of the territory once held by ISIS had been reclaimed, which is consistent with Trump's claim.", "However": "it is incorrect to say that \"it all took place since our election\" as significant territorial losses against ISIS occurred before Trump took office, with 50 percent of the territory being recaptured in the 11 months leading up to his inauguration."}
