{"Reference to recent change in state law": "The expert's verdict mentions a change in state law that gives more power to the Milwaukee County executive, specifically regarding the sale of county-owned properties that are not zoned for park use. This change in law is cited as evidence of the executive's authority to sell assets without County Board approval.", "Allegations of power grab": "County Board members have accused the Milwaukee County executive, Chris Abele, of making a power grab by taking advantage of the new state law to sell county-owned land. This suggests that there is a perception among some individuals that the executive has the ability to sell assets without oversight from the County Board.", "Example of land sale": "The expert's verdict mentions a specific instance where Abele used the new state law to sell 10 acres of land for a downtown Milwaukee development. This example serves as evidence that the executive has successfully exercised his power to sell county-owned assets without County Board approval.", "Lack of County Board oversight": "The expert's verdict highlights Larson's claim that the County Board has no oversight over land sales, including the museum, the airport, and the zoo. This assertion implies that the executive has unilateral authority over these assets, further supporting the claim's authenticity."}
