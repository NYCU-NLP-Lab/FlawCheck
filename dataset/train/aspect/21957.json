{"Rauner": "s spokesperson provided a list of 26 states where a single filer making $59,000 would be taxed at a higher rate than in Illinois. However, this list omitted six states with graduated taxes where such a taxpayer would pay less. This aspect points out the flaws in the evidence provided by Rauner's camp, which raises doubts about the accuracy of the claim.", "The fact": "checkers previously rated a similar claim from Rauner as Mostly False, stating that it is uncertain whether the plan supported by Pritzker would result in a tax hike for the middle class. This aspect highlights the previous fact-checking analysis and its relevance to evaluating the authenticity of the claim.", "The benchmark used by Rauner": "s camp, a single filer making $59,000, is questionable as it does not accurately represent the median income for single filers. The U.S. Census data shows that the median income for single filers is slightly over $35,700. This aspect highlights the discrepancy in the metrics used to support the claim, further undermining its authenticity."}
