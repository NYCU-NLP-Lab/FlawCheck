{"The claim is based on a memo co": "authored by John Dowd, a lawyer for President Donald Trump, which was later published by the New York Times. This provides evidence that the claim originated from a reliable source.", "The New York Times published a document prepared by President Trump": "s legal team, which acknowledged that he had dictated an initial statement to the newspaper. This supports the claim that President Trump was involved in crafting the response.", "The claim is supported by a letter from attorneys Jay Sekulow and John Dowd": "stating that the President had dictated a \"short but accurate\" response to the New York Times article on behalf of his son, Donald Trump Jr. This provides further confirmation of the claim's authenticity.", "The claim is also supported by the email chain that shows Donald Trump Jr": "accepting help from what was described as a Russian government effort to aid his father's campaign. This corroborates the claim that the meeting with Russians took place and adds credibility to the assertion that President Trump was involved in the response."}
