{"The claim is supported by a 2019 study published in the journal Environmental Research": "which found that three-quarters of thermal paper receipts contain bisphenol A (BPA), a known endocrine disrupter linked to infertility and hormone-related cancers.", "The study conducted by the University of Granada": "UGR) analyzed over 100 receipts and tickets from Brazil, Spain, and France, providing evidence from multiple countries to support the claim.", "The study found that more than 90": "of the receipts collected in Brazil and Spain contained BPA, compared to about half of those obtained in France. However, many receipts in France contained higher concentrations of bisphenol S (BPS), which can also impact the endocrine system.", "The concentration levels of BPA found in thermal paper receipts exceeded the European Union": "recommended limit of 0.2mg/g, indicating a potential health risk for consumers.
