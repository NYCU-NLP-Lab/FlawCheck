{"Misleading clickbait advertisements featuring Amanda Bynes have been circulating for several years": "falsely portraying her former work in the movie industry, her current activities, and her alleged new job in product support.", "The claim is supported by a freeze": "frame from a scene in the 2006 film \"She's the Man,\" where Bynes lifts her shirt to prove her gender. However, the ads falsely imply that she appeared topless in the movie, misleading viewers.", "An online advertisement in January 2021 showcased the same scene from": "She's the Man\" and included a picture of Amanda Bynes, claiming she now works in a product support job from 9-5. This ad led readers to a slideshow article titled \"Former Stars Who Now Have Normal Jobs\" on Gazillions.com, further reinforcing the claim.", "The photograph used in the ad was genuine": "showing Bynes wearing a mechanic-style shirt with \"Willie Product Support\" written on it. However, the claim that the picture depicted her currently working a new job from 9-5 was false, as the shirt was likely a style choice or a joke based on the supposed company name. Additionally, the person's name on the shirt was \"Rich,\" not Amanda Bynes."}
