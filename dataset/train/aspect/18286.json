{"Comparison of gas taxes and oil company profits": "The expert compared the amount of money the state and federal governments make per gallon in gas taxes to the net income earned by the largest oil companies. This comparison was used to verify the claim that gas taxes exceed oil company profits.", "Evidence from the American Petroleum Institute": "The expert referenced a report from the American Petroleum Institute (API), a national trade group representing oil and gas companies. The API report suggested that, per dollar of sales, gas taxes are more than double the net income earned by the largest oil companies. This evidence was used to support the claim.", "Input from Stephen Comstock": "API's manager of tax policy: The expert mentioned that Stephen Comstock recommended using data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), a federal agency that compiles tax and revenue data about the biggest oil companies. While not a perfect fit for the claim, these numbers were considered the best available by government and private researchers.", "Consideration of other factors": "The expert acknowledged that the EIA data includes profits from products other than gasoline, which may not directly align with the claim. However, the expert still considered these numbers as relevant for assessing the notion that gas taxes exceed oil company profits."}
