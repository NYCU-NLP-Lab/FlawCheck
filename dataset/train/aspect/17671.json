{"Historical Circulation": "The expert mentions that the legend of a woman selling her partner's expensive car after he runs off with a younger woman has been circulating in England since at least 1948. This historical circulation adds to the authenticity of the claim.", "Newspaper Reports": "The expert refers to a version of the legend being reported as true in Ann Landers' column in 1979, with a reader claiming to have seen it in the Chicago Tribune. Although the article couldn't be located, the fact that it was reported in a reputable newspaper adds credibility to the claim.", "Personal Account": "The expert shares a personal account from the Earl of Mowbray, who describes the adventure of a friend who responded to an ad for a Rolls-Royce being sold for a very low price. The friend interacted with the owner, who explained the reason for the low price and provided details that align with the claim.", "Anecdotal Evidence": "The expert presents an anecdote about a man in California who responded to an ad for an \"almost new\" Porsche being sold for $50. The man interacts with the woman who placed the ad and verifies that the car is indeed in excellent condition.
