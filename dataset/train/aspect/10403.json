{"Buttigieg compared the estimated 10": "year revenue gap in Bernie Sanders' plans with the current U.S. GDP.", "Compared with the economy over a 10": "year period, the results are reversed, with the national economy dwarfing the revenue gap.", "The flaw in Buttigieg": "s comparison is that he used 10-year cost and revenue estimates for the Sanders plans and stacked them against one year of the nation's GDP.", "For a more accurate comparison": "one would look at the cumulative value of the economy as projected by the Congressional Budget Office over the next decade, which amounts to nearly $300 trillion worth of GDP by 2030."}
