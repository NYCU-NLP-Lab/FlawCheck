{"Lack of evidence": "The expert found no evidence to corroborate the claims made against Marquesha Johnson. They could not find any record of a lawsuit against her or any evidence of her involvement as a leading figure in the Black Lives Matter movement.", "Source credibility": "The expert identified that the original story was published on a \"satirical\" website and later republished on disreputable right-wing websites. These sources are known for spreading false information and targeting the Black Lives Matter movement and mainstream liberal news media.", "Inconsistent and fabricated information": "The expert pointed out several inconsistencies and fabrications in the claim. The image used in the articles did not depict Marquesha Johnson or her alleged million-dollar home. Instead, it was a composite image of an unrelated person and a resort in Mexico. The story also made false claims about Johnson using donations for personal gain.", "Lack of cooperation and denial": "The expert mentioned that Johnson was questioned by the police but denied misusing funds. She also refused to hand over records. This lack of cooperation and denial further raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim."}
