{"The CDC report showed a correlation between testing positive for the coronavirus and going to bars and restaurants": "where masks can\u2019t be effectively worn. This counters the claim that the July cases were \"wearing a mask\" and \"infected anyway.\"", "The CDC report did not assess the impact of mask wearing on getting the coronavirus": "and the study\u2019s authors said the participants might not be representative of the U.S. The study dealt with 154 people who tested positive in July, not all the positive cases in July.", "Masks are most effective as": "source control,\" preventing infected people from transmitting the virus. Experts say they offer the wearer some \u2014 but not total \u2014 protection.", "The data in the CDC report cannot be generalized to say": "almost everyone\" who wore a mask in July got the coronavirus. It\u2019s from a very small sample the authors said may not be representative of the United States, and mask use was self-reported. The report does not say masks don\u2019t work to slow the spread of COVID-19."}
