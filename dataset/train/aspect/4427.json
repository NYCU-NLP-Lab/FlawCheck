{"Verification of the agriculture commissioner": "s statement: The expert verified the claim by referencing the statement made by Sid Miller, the agriculture commissioner of Texas, during a symposium on water in Texas. This statement confirmed that there were towns in West Texas that were out of water and had to truck in water.", "Examination of news reports": "The expert examined various news reports provided by the Agriculture Department spokesman. These reports included instances of towns in Texas, such as Spicewood Beach and Barnhart, having to truck in water in the past. This information helped corroborate the claim of current water shortages in West Texas.", "Confirmation from a local official": "The expert reached out to John Nanny, an Irion County commissioner who serves on the board of the Barnhart Water Supply Corp. Nanny confirmed that the town of Barnhart had to truck in drinking water in July and August 2014, indicating a recent water shortage. This testimony further supported the authenticity of the claim.", "Response from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality": "The expert contacted the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and received a response from spokesman Terry Clawson. Clawson stated that as of March 12, 2015, the agency was not aware of any public water systems hauling in water. However, Clawson acknowledged that the Berry Oaks Water Company in Comal County intermittently hauls water due to summer shortfalls. This information added another perspective to the verification process."}
