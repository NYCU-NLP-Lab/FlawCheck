{"The claim is supported by the opinions of political figures such as Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders": "who voiced their support for the tax and argued that it would disproportionately affect low-income families.", "The claim is backed by evidence from studies conducted in Berkeley": "California, where a similar sugary drink tax was implemented. These studies found that a portion of the tax cost was passed on to consumers, indicating that the tax could potentially increase prices for low-income families.", "Expert opinions from Carl Davis": "the research director at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, and William Shughart, a sin tax expert, both support the claim that taxes like the one proposed in Philadelphia would disproportionately impact lower-income residents due to their higher expenditure on food and drinks.", "The claim is also supported by the suggestion from Warren Gunnels": "senior policy advisor for Bernie Sanders, that alternative methods, such as raising taxes on the wealthiest residents, could be used to finance initiatives like universal pre-school in Philadelphia, implying that the proposed soda tax would primarily affect low-income families."}
