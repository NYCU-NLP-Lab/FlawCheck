{"Barry Smitherman": "s statement: The expert's verdict mentions that Barry Smitherman, a candidate for Texas attorney general, stated in a November 2013 email that \"The earth is not warming.\" This is the initial claim that is being evaluated for authenticity.", "Contradiction with scientific consensus": "The expert's verdict highlights that Smitherman's claim contradicts the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which states that \"warming of the climate system is unequivocal.\" The IPCC report provides scientific evidence supporting the ongoing warming of the Earth.", "Reference to articles and news stories": "Smitherman's campaign consultant, Allen Blakemore, provided web links to several articles suggesting that the planet is not warming as predicted or is even cooling. These articles include references to professors and experts who argue for a cooling period or a pause in global warming. The inclusion of these references is an aspect employed to verify the claim.", "Presentation by Don Easterbrook": "Smitherman's campaign manager, Jared Craighead, urged the expert to view a video presentation by Don Easterbrook, a professor emeritus of geology. In the presentation, Easterbrook argues that minimal temperature changes support his statement from 2000 that global warming is over and that the key question is the intensity of the cooling period. This presentation is another aspect used to support the claim of the Earth not warming."}
