{"The use of a spreadsheet from the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board website": "The expert examined a spreadsheet on the website that provided data on the percentage of Texas high school graduates who enrolled in higher education in the fall after their spring graduations from 2000 through 2009.", "Confirmation from Dominic Chavez": "The expert reached out to Dominic Chavez, senior director for external relations at the coordinating board, who confirmed the figures mentioned in the spreadsheet and provided additional information about the data.", "Comparison of the board breakdown and the claim": "The expert noticed a difference between the breakdown provided by the board and the statement made by Agriculture Commissioner Todd Staples. The board's breakdown referred solely to graduates who enrolled in Texas institutions, while Staples' statement referred to graduates who went to any four-year public university.", "Limitations of the data": "The expert identified limitations in the data, such as the high percentage of graduates categorized as \"not found\" and the lack of information on graduates who went to college out of state. These limitations were acknowledged by Chavez and raised questions about the accuracy and completeness of the data."}
