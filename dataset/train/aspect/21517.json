{"Historical evidence": "The expert's verdict provides historical evidence of the NRA's inception as a marksmanship training group in 1871, which is distinct from the claim that it was formed to combat the Ku Klux Klan and help freed slaves.", "Rhetorical tactics": "The expert highlights the NRA's use of racially divisive rhetoric, such as exploiting wedge issues like illegal immigration and urban crime to increase membership. This contradicts the claim that the NRA was formed to combat racist organizations.", "Wayne LaPierre": "s editorial: The expert mentions an editorial by Wayne LaPierre, the NRA's executive vice president, where he encouraged Americans to buy more guns due to a purported threat from border-crossing gang members. This editorial does not align with the claim that the NRA was formed to protect freed slaves.", "Testimony from supporters": "The expert cites statements from individuals like David Barton and Harry Alford, who praise the NRA for its legacy and claim that it was founded to protect freed slaves from the Ku Klux Klan. This aspect presents a differing viewpoint and supports the claim's authenticity."}
