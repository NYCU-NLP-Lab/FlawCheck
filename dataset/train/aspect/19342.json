{"House Majority Leader Eric Cantor": "s statement: Cantor stated that \"The IRS will have access to the American people\u2019s protected health care information\" during a floor debate on August 2nd. This statement forms the basis of the claim being analyzed.", "Distrust of the IRS": "Cantor expressed his distrust of the IRS, citing their previous actions of giving special scrutiny to conservative groups seeking tax exemptions. He argued that giving the IRS access to personal medical records would be a government overreach.", "Passage of the": "Keep the IRS off your Health Care Act\": Shortly after Cantor's comments, the House approved the bill that would prevent the IRS from any involvement in Obamacare. This legislative action suggests that there are concerns about the IRS accessing health care information.", "Breitbart article and HHS response": "Cantor's spokesperson cited a Breitbart article that discussed concerns about the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) sharing information with the IRS. However, HHS officials have repeatedly stated that they will not be seeking intimate medical details or sharing information with the IRS. This provides a counterpoint to Cantor's claim."}
