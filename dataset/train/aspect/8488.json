{"The claim is ambiguous and lacks specificity in terms of what metric is being used to determine the ranking of homicide rates": "The expert questions whether the claim refers to all intentional homicides or just gun-related ones, as well as whether it is based on the murder rate or the absolute number of murders committed.", "The expert highlights the difficulty in finding any metric that supports the claim of the United States being the third highest in murders worldwide": "Statistics from reputable sources such as the World Bank and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNDOC) place the United States much lower in the rankings of intentional homicide rates.", "The expert mentions that if the comparison is based on the absolute number of murders": "the United States would still only rank eighth, not third, among all countries. However, using the absolute number for comparison is considered a poor metric, as it doesn't account for factors such as population size.", "The expert provides a list of the top ten countries with the highest murder rates": "none of which include the United States. This further contradicts the claim and suggests that the United States is not among the countries with the highest rates of homicides worldwide."}
