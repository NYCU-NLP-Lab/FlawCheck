{"Examination of the photographs": "The expert conducted a reverse-image search of the photographs shared on social media and found that they were actually from a year-old incident in Rajasthan's Karauli district. This contradicted the claim that Naseer Khan raped and murdered an 8-year-old girl.", "Post": "mortem report: The expert referred to the post-mortem report of the actual incident, which stated that the girl's cause of death was strangulation and there was no evidence of rape. This further discredited the claim made about Naseer Khan.", "Police investigation and arrest": "The expert mentioned the police investigation and subsequent arrest of Mahendra Mina in connection with the actual murder. The motive behind the crime was identified as a lovers' spat, which again contradicted the claim being made about Naseer Khan.", "Age of the victim": "The expert pointed out that the girl in question was not 8 years old, as claimed, but actually 19 years old. This discrepancy in the age of the victim further undermined the authenticity of the claim."}
