{"Lack of evidence": "The expert's verdict states that there is no evidence to support the claim that Tallahassee reduced its carbon intensity by roughly 40 percent under Andrew Gillum's leadership. This indicates that there is no concrete data or proof to back up the claim.", "City data collection": "The city of Tallahassee collects data on carbon intensity, which is the amount of carbon emitted per unit of energy consumed. This data is collected annually and is required to be reported under federal law. The expert mentions that the data shows a decline in carbon intensity of around 40 percent since 1990, but the decline has not been consistent.", "Factors contributing to carbon reduction": "The expert mentions that the reduction in carbon intensity could be attributed to various factors such as implementing more efficient utilities, switching to cleaner fuels, and other initiatives enacted by Andrew Gillum as mayor since 2014. These factors suggest that the reduction in carbon emissions is a result of long-term efforts and not solely under Gillum's leadership.", "Updated claim": "The expert notes that the claim on Gillum's campaign website was updated to include more nuance about the decrease in carbon intensity. The updated claim states that Tallahassee has reduced its carbon emission intensity by 40 percent over the last two decades and has reduced the carbon footprint of electricity users in the city by 20 percent under Gillum's leadership. This indicates that the claim was revised to provide a more accurate representation of the achievements in carbon reduction."}
