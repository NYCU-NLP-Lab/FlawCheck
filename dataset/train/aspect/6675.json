{"The source of the claim": "The expert's verdict highlights that the claim originated from a fake news article on the website www.breakingnews365.net. The About section of the website clearly states that it is an entertainment website where users create fictional news.", "Lack of credibility of the source": "The expert points out that the website itself states that the news should not be taken seriously or as a source of information. Additionally, the website offers users the option to create their own articles and prank their friends, indicating a lack of credibility.", "Inconsistencies and lack of evidence": "The expert mentions that the article does not provide any specific details about when the alleged name change took place or any official documentation or sources to support the claim. The Washington State Legislature's report of bills passed in 2017 also does not mention any bill related to changing the state's name.", "Lack of motive or evidence against George Soros": "The expert states that the claim suggests that the name change was a result of George Soros' efforts to eliminate the history of slavery in the United States. However, there is no apparent history or evidence to support this claim, making it less credible."}
