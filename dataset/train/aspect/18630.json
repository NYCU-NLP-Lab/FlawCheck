{"Statistics on sexual assault on college campuses": "The expert's verdict mentions that U.S Sen. Mark Warner claimed that \"one out of every five women are victims of sexual assault when they\u2019re on college campuses.\" This statistic is used to support the claim that it is safer not to be in college than to be in college.", "Report by the U": "S. Department of Justice's National Institute of Justice (NIJ): The expert's verdict mentions a 2005 report by the NIJ that states, \"college women are at higher risk for sexual assault than their non-college-bound peers.\" The report is based on a survey conducted in 1997 among 4,446 female college students, where almost 16 percent reported experiencing victimization.", "Academic studies on sexual assault on campuses": "The expert's verdict mentions that the NIJ report cited academic studies from the late 1980s and 1990s that examined sexual assault on campuses in the U.S. and Canada. One of the studies published in the journal Criminology found that the rate of rape and sexual assault among college students was about three times higher than that of all women aged 20-24.", "Limitations of the studies": "The expert's verdict highlights that both the NIJ report and the academic studies mentioned had limitations. They did not survey non-students, which makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions about the risk of sexual assault for college women compared to non-college-bound peers. The age range of the women students interviewed in the studies is also not specified."}
