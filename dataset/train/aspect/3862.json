{"The number of executive orders signed by President Biden": "The expert's verdict mentions that Biden has signed more than 40 executive orders, actions, and memorandums during his first few weeks in office. The claim states that he has issued 32 executive orders, so the first aspect of verification would be to confirm the accurate number of executive orders signed by President Biden.", "Comparison with previous presidents": "The expert's verdict mentions that social media posts compare Biden's executive orders to those of past presidents. The claim includes a comparison with Barack Obama and Donald Trump, stating that Biden signed more executive orders in his first week than Obama (9) and Trump (5). Verifying this comparison and determining the accuracy of the numbers would be another aspect of verification.", "Context and purpose of the executive orders": "The expert's verdict explains that Biden's executive orders cover a wide range of issues, including healthcare, the economy, and undoing some of the previous administration's policies. Verifying the specific topics and purposes of these executive orders would provide further evidence to support or refute the claim.", "Misquotations and misattributions": "The expert's verdict mentions that some individuals, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and Fox News personality Sean Hannity, have misquoted Biden in an attempt to criticize his use of executive orders. The claim includes a quote attributed to Biden that says, \"Only a Dictator legislates through executive orders!\" Verifying the accuracy of these quotes and identifying any misattributions would be another aspect of verification."}
