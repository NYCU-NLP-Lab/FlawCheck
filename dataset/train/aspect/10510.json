{"Lack of evidence": "The expert's verdict mentions that Eichelberger's office did not provide any evidence to substantiate his claim. This lack of evidence raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Inconsistency with existing research": "The expert refers to studies and academics who were not familiar with any papers supporting the idea that \"less intensive\" instruction would lead to more success for inner-city students. This inconsistency with existing research undermines the credibility of the claim.", "Expert opinion": "The expert, Julia C. Duncheon, who specializes in college readiness for urban students, states that it is \"not true\" that lower-income students need \"less intensive\" instruction. She points to studies that show the opposite, suggesting that rigorous classes are more likely to lead to college persistence.", "Importance of rigorous curriculum": "The Institute for Higher Education Policy emphasizes the importance of a rigorous, college-ready curriculum for all students, including those from low-income backgrounds. This emphasis on the significance of a rigorous curriculum contradicts the idea of a \"less intensive\" track for inner-city students."}
