{"Lack of consensus on methodology and definitions": "The expert mentions that there is no agreement on the methodology or definitions that should be used to research the number of deaths caused by lack of access to affordable healthcare. This lack of consensus makes it difficult to accurately determine the number of deaths.", "Comparison of deaths caused": "The expert highlights that terrorist acts and homicides committed by undocumented immigrants account for a relatively small portion of all violent deaths in the United States. They argue that research suggests that the lack of affordable healthcare causes many more deaths each year. This comparison of the number of deaths caused by different factors helps verify the claim.", "Rarity of terrorist attacks": "The expert states that terrorist attacks are relatively rare events in the United States and have resulted in a small number of fatalities in recent years. This information supports the claim that lack of affordable healthcare causes more deaths annually than terrorist attacks.", "Targeting and motives of terrorist acts": "The expert explains that victims of terrorist acts are typically not individually targeted in advance, but rather they are either arbitrary or part of a symbolically targeted group. This information helps distinguish the nature of terrorist attacks and further supports the claim that lack of affordable healthcare leads to more deaths compared to terrorist attacks."}
