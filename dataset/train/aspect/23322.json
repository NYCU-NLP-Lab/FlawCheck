{"Lack of evidence": "The expert's verdict highlights that the Facebook post alleging treason charges against James Comey and John Brennan provides no evidence to support the claim. This lack of evidence raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Facebook flagging": "The post was flagged by Facebook as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation. This suggests that the social media platform has identified the claim as potentially false or misleading, further questioning its authenticity.", "Investigation by federal prosecutor": "The expert's verdict mentions that federal prosecutor John Durham was investigating the role Brennan played in the intelligence community's assessment of Russian interference in the 2016 election. However, neither Brennan nor Comey have been indicted, indicating that there is no concrete evidence of treason charges against them.", "Constitutional definition of treason": "The expert's verdict points out that the Constitution defines treason narrowly, stating that it can only consist of \"levying war\" against the country or giving \"aid and comfort\" to its enemies. This suggests that the claim of treason charges against Comey and Brennan may not meet the legal criteria for treason, further casting doubt on its authenticity."}
