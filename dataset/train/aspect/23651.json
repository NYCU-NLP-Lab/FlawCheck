{"Rep": "Ilhan Omar's statement that \"the 1% is paying less in taxes than everyone else\" is supported by the claim that the richest 400 households in the United States paid a lower effective tax rate than households in any other income range. This is based on the book \"The Triumph of Injustice\" by University of California-Berkeley economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman.", "However": "critics have questioned the methodology used by Saez and Zucman, arguing that it exaggerates the amount of taxes paid by lower-income Americans. They point out that the analysis excluded refundable tax credits such as the earned income tax credit and the child tax credit, which are administered through the tax code. This omission artificially shows higher tax payments for lower-income households that take advantage of these credits, according to the nonpartisan Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center.", "The expert": "s verdict acknowledges that while Omar's assertion is more complicated than she portrayed it, she is correct in stating that the number of uninsured Americans is significant. The most recent annual report by the U.S. Census Bureau found that almost 27.5 million Americans lacked health insurance for all of 2018."}
