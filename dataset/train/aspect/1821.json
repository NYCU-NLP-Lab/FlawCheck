{"Lack of news coverage": "The expert found no news relating to the alleged incident of a Sikh truck driver being assaulted in Uttar Pradesh. This lack of media coverage raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Origin of the video": "The expert discovered that the video being circulated with the claim was originally posted on YouTube by the 'akaalchannel' channel three months ago. The video was titled 'Truth Behind Viral Video of Beaten Up Sikhs in Assam.' This suggests that the video is unrelated to the alleged incident in Uttar Pradesh.", "Verification through Google search": "The expert conducted a Google search using keywords related to the alleged incident and came across a link that provided information about the actual incident. This link confirmed that the video was from Kamrup district in Assam, not Uttar Pradesh.", "Date of the incident": "The expert noted that the incident shown in the video took place in February 2018, which contradicts the claim of it happening recently in Uttar Pradesh. The time difference further raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim."}
