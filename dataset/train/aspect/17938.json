{"The expert verified the claim by examining an official": "looking letter displayed in the TV commercial, which stated that there was a $7 million surplus in Providence when Vincent A. \"Buddy\" Cianci left office in 2002.", "The expert cross": "referenced the information in the letter with city financial reports, which confirmed that the surplus had indeed grown to $8.3 million by June 30, 2002.", "The expert also referenced Providence Journal stories on the city": "s financial state after Angel Taveras took over as mayor in 2011. These stories were based on a report commissioned by Taveras, which projected a structural deficit of $110 million in the 2011-2012 fiscal year.", "By considering the logic behind the report": "s projection, the expert argued that the $110 million deficit figure was also applicable to the year 2008, when David Cicilline was in his second term as mayor."}
