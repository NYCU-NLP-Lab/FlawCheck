This suggests that the image is not authentic and was likely created using more modern techniques.", "Introduction of photographer Harry Pointer": "The expert introduces photographer Harry Pointer and his famous \"Brighton Cats\" series of photographs from the 1870s. By highlighting Pointer's work, the expert establishes a timeline and shows that cat photography predates the claimed image.", "Review of Pointer": "s photographs: The expert references a review of Pointer's photographs published in The Art Journal of London in 1879.
