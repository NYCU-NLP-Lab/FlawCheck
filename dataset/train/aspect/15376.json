{"The expert considered the statement made by Governor Scott Walker": "who claimed that employers repeatedly mentioned the anti-business litigation climate as a major factor in their expansion decisions. The expert analyzed Walker's statement and found it to be true.", "The expert examined four national surveys cited by Walker": "including a 2010 national poll for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a 2007 national survey for the chamber, and two surveys conducted by private groups surveying the public and doctors. These surveys showed varying levels of concern and support for tort reform and the impact of the litigation environment on business decisions.", "The expert noted that the national surveys did not provide state": "specific results or rank concerns about the litigation climate against other factors influencing relocation or expansion decisions. This suggests that while there may be some level of concern about the litigation climate, it may not be the most important factor for all employers.", "The expert also mentioned that Walker did not provide any specific information about Wisconsin or cite any Wisconsin": "specific data to support his claim. Therefore, the expert's analysis could not verify the authenticity of the claim specifically for Wisconsin employers."}
