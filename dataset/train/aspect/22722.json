{"The claim falsely implies that Congress rejected a": "336 per month increase in Social Security and disability benefits while approving an $8,872 per month increase for themselves. This aspect highlights the misleading nature of the claim and the false comparison being made.", "The determination of cost": "of-living adjustments for Social Security and Supplemental Security Income benefits is not done by Congress but by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. This aspect emphasizes that Congress does not have direct control over the adjustments and that they are based on the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers.", "The claim inaccurately states that Congress approved an": "8,872 per month increase for themselves. In reality, Congress had not decided on an automatic increase in pay for its members for 2020. The claim fails to acknowledge that the proposed increase of $4,500 annually was not approved and that the salary for members of the House and Senate remained at $174,000 per year.", "Congressional pay raises are determined by the Employment Cost Index and are automatic unless voted down by Congress": "The claim falsely suggests that Congress approves pay raises for themselves regularly, when in fact, they have not allowed a pay raise since 2009.
