{"The claim is based on an ad by the American Future Fund": "a conservative organization that does not disclose its donors and has a history of attacking Democrats.", "The ad cites an InsideGov ranking of members of Congress": "which ranks Patrick Murphy as one of the least effective congressmen. However, the ranking only considers Murphy's tenure through 2014 and does not include bills introduced in the current Congress.", "The InsideGov ranking is criticized for being based on a single measure": "the percentage of bills sponsored by each member that passed committee. This measure is considered insufficient to evaluate the overall effectiveness of a member of Congress.", "Political scientists": "such as Craig Volden and Alan Wiseman, have developed more sophisticated methods to evaluate legislator effectiveness, but these methods were not used in the claim's assessment."}
