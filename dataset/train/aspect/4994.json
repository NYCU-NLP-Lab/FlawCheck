{"The claim is supported by the Republican Jewish Coalition": "s campaign called \"My Buyer's Remorse,\" which includes a $5 million television ad buy in several battleground states, targeting Jewish voters and stating that Obama \"refuses to acknowledge Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.\"", "The claim is also supported by a direct": "mail brochure sent to voters, stating that Obama is \"wrong on Israel, wrong on our economy,\" with the first statement highlighting his refusal to acknowledge Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.", "The claim is further supported by the fact that Mitt Romney": "the Republican presidential candidate, made a similar claim in a TV ad that aired in August 2012.", "The claim is countered by the fact that the United States": "like all other countries, does not formally recognize any state as having sovereignty over Jerusalem. The official position involves some tip-toeing due to the decades-long conflict between Jews and Palestinians, both of whom consider Jerusalem their capital and a holy site. However, candidate Obama previously declared that \"Jerusalem will remain the capital of Israel, and it must remain undivided,\" which pleased the pro-Israel lobby."}
