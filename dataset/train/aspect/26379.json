{"The claim is supported by evidence from the History Hustle Facebook page": "which states that MIT offers a \"Pirate Certificate\" to students who complete courses in archery, pistol shooting, sailing, and fencing.", "The claim is further verified by the MIT Physical Education department": "which has been handing out physical \"pirate certificates\" since the Fall semester of 2011 to any student who successfully completes the required courses.", "The existence of": "Pirate Induction\" days and the presence of MIT students proudly displaying their pirate certificates on the department's Facebook page provide visual evidence of the authenticity of the claim.", "Testimonies from a 2014 MIT graduate and owner of the pirate certificate": "Jacob Hurwitz, along with the mention of a survey sent to students in 2010, indicate that the pirate certificate was initially a joke invented by students but later became an official recognition by the university."}
