{"The ad claims that Rick Scott vetoed funding for 30 Florida rape crisis centers": "implying that he completely rejected funding for these centers. The expert's verdict clarifies that Scott did veto $1.5 million of additional funding in 2012, but the centers still received $1.4 million from the Rape Crisis Trust Fund and $500,000 from the attorney general. This aspect verifies that Scott did veto some funding but not all funding for the centers.", "The ad suggests that Scott said the rape crisis centers weren": "t needed, but the expert's verdict states that there is no direct quote from Scott to support this claim. Instead, Scott's spokesman at the time, Lane Wright, stated that the new funding would have been duplicative since the state already funds sexual violence programs. This aspect verifies that Scott did not explicitly state that the centers were unnecessary.", "The expert": "s verdict reveals that Scott vetoed the funding during Sexual Assault Awareness Month, which drew significant scrutiny, particularly from left-leaning websites. This aspect verifies that the timing of Scott's veto added to the controversy surrounding his decision and contributed to the ad's attack on his record."}
