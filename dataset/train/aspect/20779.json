The spokesperson claims that McCaskill's meetings were in a group setting and focused on policy matters, while Sessions' meeting with the ambassador was one-on-one and occurred during a time of suspected Russian election meddling.", "The expert also mentions that there is photographic evidence of Sen": "McCaskill sitting across the table from the Russian ambassador during a meeting. This further undermines her claim of never having any interaction with him.", "The expert mentions that Sen": "McCaskill later published clarifications downplaying the significance of her interactions with the Russian ambassador. This suggests that she may have realized the inconsistency of her initial claim and attempted to minimize its importance."}
