{"The authorship of the claim was verified by identifying the actual writer of the opinion piece": "which was found to be Robert A. Hall, a former Massachusetts state senator and U.S. Marine Corps veteran. This was confirmed through his blog, where the piece titled \"I'm Tired\" was published on February 19, 2009.", "The age discrepancy between the claimed author": "Bill Cosby, and the actual author, Robert A. Hall, was highlighted. The expert's verdict states that Bill Cosby is 75 years old, while the claim refers to the author as being 83 years old. This inconsistency further supports the conclusion that Bill Cosby did not write the opinion piece.", "The expert": "s verdict also mentions that the claim has been widely circulated on the internet since August 2011, presenting it as the work of Bill Cosby. This indicates that the claim has been falsely attributed to Cosby and has been circulating for a significant period of time.", "The denial statement from Bill Cosby himself": "which was found on his official website, was used as evidence to verify the authenticity of the claim. Cosby explicitly states that he did not write the email and does not subscribe to the views expressed in it. This statement from the actual person involved refutes the claim and confirms its inauthenticity."}
