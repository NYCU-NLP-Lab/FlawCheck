{"Lack of permit": "The expert's verdict highlights that one aspect employed to verify the authenticity of the claim is whether the Black Lives Matter (BLM) protesters had a permit for their demonstration. The claim suggests that the occupation was illegal due to the absence of a permit.", "Harassment of neighbors": "Another aspect mentioned by the expert is the alleged harassment of neighbors by the BLM protesters. This factor was cited as a reason for considering the occupation illegal.", "Video evidence": "The expert's analysis mentions that the protesters recorded video footage of the rally, which is available on a public Facebook page. The video was examined to determine if the protesters engaged in any illegal activities or if they blocked traffic.", "Legal opinion": "The expert cites the opinion of ACLU PA deputy legal director Mary Catherine Roper, who stated that the BLM protest did not violate any laws. Roper argues that the demonstration was too small to require a permit and did not impede the use of sidewalks or streets by others. This legal perspective was used to assess the claim's authenticity."}
