{"The source of the claim": "The expert verifies that Mitt Romney's claim about 20 million people losing their insurance as Obamacare goes into effect next year was based on a study conducted by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO).", "The CBO": "s baseline estimate: The expert explains that the CBO's baseline estimate projected a decline of 3 million to 5 million non-elderly people obtaining coverage through their employer each year from 2019 through 2022, and an additional decline of 1 million to 3 million Americans with individually purchased policies.", "Alternative scenarios": "The expert highlights that the CBO also provided four alternative scenarios, one of which resulted in a decline of 20 million people with employer-sponsored insurance. However, it is noted that these alternative scenarios were widely divergent and not in line with other estimates.", "Other estimates": "The expert mentions that estimates from other groups, such as the Urban Institute and the Lewin Group, projected much lower declines in the number of people losing insurance, with figures ranging from about 500,000 to a few million. This suggests that Romney's claim of 20 million people losing insurance may not align with these alternative estimates."}
