{"Lack of evidence": "The expert found no evidence that Mark Twain said or wrote the first half of the quote, \"Do not fear the enemy, for your enemy can only take your life. It is far better that you fear the media, for they will steal your honor.\" This lack of evidence suggests that the claim may be inauthentic.", "Historical context": "The expert pointed out that during the time period when Mark Twain was alive, the term \"the media\" was not used in the same way it is today. There was only one form of mass communication, which was print. This historical context raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Expert opinions": "The expert reached out to Alan Gribben, the editor of the Mark Twain Journal, who expressed doubts that Twain ever used the word \"media\" in the context of the quote. Additionally, Barbara Schmidt, a Mark Twain researcher, pointed to a speech where Twain made a similar statement about the power of the press. These expert opinions cast further doubt on the authenticity of the claim.", "Facebook flagging": "The claim was flagged by Facebook as part of their efforts to combat false news and misinformation. This flagging suggests that there may be concerns about the claim's authenticity and its potential to mislead or deceive readers."}
