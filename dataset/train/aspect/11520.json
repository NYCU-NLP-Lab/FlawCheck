{"The claim originated from a tweet posted by Raw Story": "a news website, stating that the United States Postal Service (USPS) failed to deliver 27 percent of mail-in ballots in South Florida.", "The claim was supported by articles from reputable sources such as Essence and the Miami Herald": "which reported on undelivered ballots found at a Miami-Dade post office.", "The number cited in the claim was based on a tweet from John Kruzel": "a reporter for The Hill and a former PolitiFact reporter, who stated that the USPS said 300,000 mail-in ballots lacked a delivery scan.", "However": "it was noted that the statistics might be misleading because postal workers were manually postmarking ballots for expedited delivery, resulting in ballots not being scanned into the system. The local turnaround process, where ballots stay in the delivery unit and are postmarked before being provided to the board of elections, was not captured in service performance data."}
