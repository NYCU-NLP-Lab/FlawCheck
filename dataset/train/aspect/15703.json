{"The expert states that there were some separations under previous administrations": "but no blanket policy to prosecute parents and separate them from their children. This contradicts the claim that the Obama and Bush administrations had similar policies to the current administration.", "The expert quotes Sarah Pierce": "a policy analyst with the Migration Policy Institute, who confirms that the mass separation of parents and children like what is currently happening was not a policy under the Bush and Obama administrations.", "The expert mentions that under the": "zero tolerance policy\" announced by Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the administration is now referring all illegal border crossings for criminal prosecution. This has led to parents being separated from their children, as children cannot be held in detention facilities for adults. This is a new aspect that distinguishes the current administration's policy from previous administrations.", "The expert highlights the lack of available statistics on how many children may have been separated from their parents under the Obama administration": "Without this data, it is impossible to make a direct comparison between the past and present."}
