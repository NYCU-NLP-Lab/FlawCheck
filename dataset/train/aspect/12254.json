{"The 2011 Legislature made cuts in spending and changes to education aid": "which is unrelated to the claim about testing students on their respiratory system and weight.", "Lawmakers did direct schools to check the physical fitness of students": "as stated by state Rep. Mike Villarreal during a House session in 2013. This supports the claim.", "The FitnessGram program was created during the 2011 legislative session and requires all public schools to collect health information on students and test them on their respiratory system and weight": "This confirms the claim.", "However": "it is revealed that state law has required fitness tests for students since the 2007-08 school year, with the 2011 Legislature only making changes to limit certain tests to students enrolled in physical education classes. This shows that the claim about the 2011 Legislature ordering the testing of every student on their respiratory system and weight is not entirely accurate."}
