{"Lack of evidence": "Despite extensive research and inquiries, no concrete evidence or records have been found to verify that Lee Fisher actually made the statement, \"I never met a gun control bill I didn\u2019t like.\" This lack of evidence suggests that the claim may not be authentic.", "Multiple sources checked": "The expert's investigation involved reaching out to various groups and individuals who have used the quote against Fisher, including the Buckeye Firearms Association, the Ohio Republican Party, the campaign of Rob Portman, and even the National Rifle Association. These sources were consulted to gather information and verify the authenticity of the claim.", "Examination of historical references": "The quote has been cited since at least 1994, making it a piece of political folklore associated with Fisher. The expert's investigation involved checking decades worth of newspaper clippings, websites, and other historical references to find any evidence supporting the claim. However, no such evidence was found.", "Fisher": "s actual stance on gun control: The expert explored Fisher's positions and actions related to gun control to determine the plausibility of the quote. Fisher has a history of supporting gun control measures, such as advocating for background checks, assault-weapons bans, and similar laws in Ohio. While Fisher claims to support the Second Amendment, his actions suggest a different stance, making the quote more believable. However, the lack of direct evidence still raises doubts about its authenticity."}
