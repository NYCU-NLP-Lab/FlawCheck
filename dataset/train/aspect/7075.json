{"Confirmation from immigration attorneys": "The expert spoke with immigration attorneys who confirmed that immigrant children subject to deportation or asylum hearings are not entitled to court-appointed lawyers. These attorneys have represented clients as young as two and three years old, indicating that this practice has been ongoing for years.", "Constitutional guarantee": "The expert explains that in the United States, any defendant in a criminal case is constitutionally entitled to be represented by a court-appointed attorney at no cost if they cannot afford to hire their own. However, this guarantee does not extend to civil cases or immigration courts. This distinction highlights the lack of free legal aid for children in immigration court.", "Availability of pro bono representation": "While defendants in immigration court do not have a right to court-appointed free legal aid, they have the right to obtain legal representation from non-profit organizations and law firms that work on a pro bono basis. This indicates that there are options for legal assistance, although the availability might not always be guaranteed.", "Indirect government contribution": "The federal government indirectly contributes to the assistance of immigrants facing deportation and other legal issues through the Office for Refugee Resettlement. This office contracts with the non-profit Vera Institute for Justice, which further sub-contracts with multiple organizations across the country to provide free legal representation and advice to immigrants. This demonstrates that while not directly court-appointed, there are efforts to provide some level of legal aid to those in need."}
