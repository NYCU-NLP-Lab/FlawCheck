McCaul regarding the use of baby dolls to conceal chemical explosives was mentioned in the FBI affidavit submitted to secure the arrest warrant for the Lubbock terror suspect. The affidavit states that the suspect had made numerous internet searches related to infants and babies, viewed photos of realistic-looking newborn and infant dolls, and visited websites related to baby accessories.", "Connection to Khalid Shaikh Mohammed and Ramzi Yousef": "The expert's verdict verifies that Rep. McCaul's claim also mentions a connection between the Lubbock terror suspect's alleged plan and Khalid Shaikh Mohammed and Ramzi Yousef. The expert's verdict provides information on the Bojinka plot, which was linked to Mohammed and Yousef, who are known for their involvement in other high-profile terrorist activities.", "Intent and guilt left for the court to decide": "The expert's verdict clarifies that while Rep. McCaul's claim makes connections between the Lubbock terror suspect's alleged plan and the 1995 plot, it does not pass judgment on the suspect's intent or guilt.
