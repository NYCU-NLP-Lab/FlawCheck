{"The claim is verified by providing a direct quote from Tim Kaine": "s testimony before a U.S. Senate hearing on climate change and the Chesapeake Bay in 2007. The quote clearly states that Kaine supports legislation that includes a cap-and-trade program for emissions of all greenhouse gases.", "The expert": "s verdict also includes a quote from Senator John McCain, who introduced a similar bill in 2003, stating that the economic costs of air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions are not factored into the price of power produced by fossil-fueled technologies. This supports the idea that higher energy costs might be necessary to address these environmental concerns.", "The explanation of how cap and trade works provides additional evidence for the claim": "It states that under cap and trade, the government would limit emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, and companies would either have to reduce emissions or obtain credits to exceed limits. This suggests that higher energy costs could be a result of companies needing to invest in cleaner technology or purchase credits."}
