{"The woman in the photograph is not Ricky Ellsworth": "but Justine Damond, who was killed by a police officer named Mohamed Noor in Minneapolis in 2017.", "Ricky Ellsworth was not killed by a black police officer in Minnesota": "The claim is based on a flawed comparison and conflates two unrelated incidents.", "The actual person named Ricci Ellsworth was killed in 1997 by her ex": "boyfriend Michael Rimmer, who was not a police officer. The incident occurred near Memphis, Tennessee, not in Minnesota.", "The claim": "s assertion that there were no protests or riots after Ricky Ellsworth's death is misleading, as the vigils held in Justine Damond's name following her killing were not on the same scale as protests against racial injustice and police brutality."}
