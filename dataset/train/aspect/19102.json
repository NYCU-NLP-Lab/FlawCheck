{"The claim is based on a story in The Virginian": "Pilot on September 24, 2009, which reported that Forbes magazine had named Virginia the best state for business for the fourth consecutive year during Tim Kaine's governorship.", "The expert examines the metrics used by Forbes to determine the rankings": "which include business costs, labor supplies, regulatory environment, current economic climate, the state's growth prospects, and quality of life.", "The expert quotes Kurt Badenhausen": "a senior editor at Forbes, who states that the rankings are based on these economic metrics and does not explicitly attribute Virginia's No. 1 status to Tim Kaine's efforts as governor.", "The expert also notes that Forbes started its annual": "best state\" rankings in August 2006, just seven months into Kaine's term as governor, suggesting that it was unlikely for Kaine to have had a major impact on Virginia's business climate in such a short time."}
