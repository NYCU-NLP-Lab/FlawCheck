{"The MS": "13 gang was formed in Los Angeles in the 1980s, years before Barack Obama became president.", "The FBI has been using the estimate of 10": "000 MS-13 members since 2006, indicating that the claim of recent significant growth is not supported by available data.", "The origins and spread of MS": "13 date back much earlier than Obama's presidency, contradicting the claim that his administration allowed the gang to form in cities across the country.", "Multiple reports and sources confirm that the formation of MS": "13 was a result of El Salvadoran immigrants banding together for protection against Mexican-American gangs, rather than a consequence of weak immigration policies during the Obama administration."}
