{"Ron Paul": "s statement: The expert's verdict mentions that Ron Paul made the claim in December 2007 that if the government stopped collecting income tax, the funding level would be similar to that of 10 years ago. This is the initial aspect that was employed to verify the authenticity of the claim.", "Lack of response from Paul": "s campaign: The expert mentions that they reached out to Paul's campaign to inquire about the numbers he used to arrive at his conclusion but did not receive a response. This lack of response prompted the expert to conduct their own investigation.", "Analysis of IRS statistics": "The expert delved into IRS statistics to gather data on income tax collections in the United States. They found that in 2005, the IRS collected $880 billion in individual income tax, and when subtracted from the total tax collections of close to $2 trillion for that year, the remaining amount was $1.12 trillion. In comparison, total tax collections in 1995 were approximately $1.27 trillion. This analysis provided concrete numbers to evaluate the claim's accuracy.", "Calculation of the difference and its implications": "The expert calculated the difference between the tax collections in 2005 and 1995, which amounted to about 12 percent or approximately $150 billion. They also mentioned that adjusting for inflation would result in a roughly 30 percent shortfall. This calculation allowed for a clearer understanding of the potential impact of eliminating income tax on government revenues."}
