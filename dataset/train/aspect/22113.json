This indicates that the claim is not based on factual information.", "Debunked conspiracy theories": "The expert's verdict mentions that the concept of the Illuminati, a shadowy group that supposedly controls the world, has been debunked multiple times. Being related to influential families like the Bush family and the Rockefellers does not equate to confessing membership in such a group. This highlights the implausibility of the claim.", "Social connection as evidence": "The expert's verdict mentions that there is a social connection between Beyonc\u00e9 and Gwyneth Paltrow, as their daughters have celebrated birthdays together.
