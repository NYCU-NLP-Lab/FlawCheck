{"Lack of evidence for treason trial": "The expert's verdict states that there is no support for the claim that former President Barack Obama will be tried for treason. This lack of evidence undermines the authenticity of the claim.", "False assertion about stripping away title and actions": "The claim falsely asserts that if a president is found guilty of treason, their title and all their presidential actions would be undone. The expert's verdict clarifies that this is untrue and that a conviction of treason would not affect a former president's actions.", "Expert consensus": "The expert's verdict highlights that multiple law professors agree that the claim is baseless. They state that a treason conviction would not automatically undo a former president's work, and the notion of Obama being tried for treason is laughable.", "Constitutional definition of treason": "The expert's verdict includes the constitutional definition of treason, which specifies that it consists of levying war against the United States. This definition further supports the conclusion that the claim lacks authenticity."}
