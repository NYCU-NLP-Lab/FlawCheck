{"The claim is supported by a tweet from Rock the Vote": "an organization focused on increasing young registered voters, stating that \"50% of #millennials don't associate w/ any political party.\"", "The claim is based on a study released by Pew Research Center": "which conducted a telephone survey of 1,821 adults nationwide, including 617 millennials ages 18 to 33. The study analyzed previous surveys and asked a variety of questions to determine the political affiliations of millennials.", "The survey found that 50 percent of millennials describe themselves as political independents": "up from 38 percent in 2004. However, a follow-up question revealed that among those who identified as independents, 44 percent leaned Democratic and 31 percent leaned Republican.", "When including": "leaners,\" Pew found that half of millennials identify as Democrats or lean towards the Democratic Party, which is 16 points greater than those who identify or lean Republican. This suggests that while millennials may claim to be independents, their partisan leanings and voting behavior align more with the Democratic Party."}
