{"State tax data from the Tax Foundation": "The expert mentions that State Sen. Jason Carter based his claims on information from the Tax Foundation. The expert verifies the authenticity of the claim by finding the Tax Foundation's \"Facts and Figures\" report of state tax data for fiscal year 2011, which includes state tax and federal dependency data.", "Comparison of state tax collections per capita": "The expert analyzes the Tax Foundation's data and confirms that Georgia ranked last in state taxes collected per capita, with $1,639. This verifies the claim that Georgia collects fewer state taxes per capita than any other state.", "Comparison of state revenue collected per capita": "The expert also examines the Tax Foundation's data on state revenue collected per capita and finds that Georgia ranked last, with $3,807. This further supports the claim that Georgia collects less state revenue than other states.", "Dependency on federal government funds": "The expert mentions that State Sen. Jason Carter claimed Georgia is the eighth-most-dependent state on the federal government. While the exact methodology for determining dependency is not explicitly mentioned, the expert does mention that Carter cited an Atlanta Journal-Constitution article as a second source for his dependency claim. Although the expert does not provide further details on the verification of this aspect, it can be inferred that the claim was at least partially supported by the cited article."}
