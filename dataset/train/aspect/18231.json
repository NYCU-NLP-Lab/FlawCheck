{"The video was originally posted on the Facebook page": "Eye On Islam\" on November 28, 2016, and reached a wide audience.", "The video does not show a group of Muslim migrants": "but rather a German \"rocker\" group called Bahoz, which describes itself as an \"anti-racist, anti-fascist\" group comprised mainly of Kurdish men.", "The video was not taken in Berlin or anywhere else in Germany": "contrary to the claim. It has been circulating since at least July 12, 2016, when it was published on YouTube by the \"Rocker Blog.\"", "German": "language outlets reported tensions between Bahoz and a rival group called Osmanen, suggesting that the march depicted in the video was related to this conflict rather than any declaration of war or involvement of Muslim migrants."}
