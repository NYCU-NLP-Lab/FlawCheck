{"Lack of evidence or historical records": "The expert mentions that there is no historical evidence or records to support the claim that Wisconsin sold fresh water to California and suffered job and farmland losses in the process.", "Inconsistency with known facts": "The expert points out that California surpassed Wisconsin in milk production two decades ago, indicating that Wisconsin is no longer considered America's Dairyland. This contradicts the claim that Wisconsin sold fresh water to boost California's dairy industry.", "Lack of previous knowledge or awareness": "The expert states that they have never heard of Wisconsin selling fresh water to California for the purpose of boosting their dairy industry. This suggests that there is no prior knowledge or awareness of such an event taking place.", "Previous proposals and backlash": "The expert mentions previous proposals to sell Great Lakes water to distant regions, such as Asia and the Southwest. However, these proposals were met with backlash and were ultimately canceled or retracted. This suggests that the claim of Wisconsin selling fresh water to California is unlikely, considering the challenges and controversies surrounding similar proposals in the past."}
