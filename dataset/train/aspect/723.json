{"Investigation of the source": "The experts verified the claim by investigating the source of the video and the accompanying message. They traced the video back to its original upload on YouTube in 2017 and found that it had been shared on various websites, including a Ukrainian website and a Russian social networking site.", "Reverse image search": "The experts used a video verification browser plugin called InVID to perform a reverse image search on the viral video. This search revealed that the video had been posted on multiple websites in 2017, suggesting that it was not a recent incident as claimed in the message.", "Verification of comments": "The experts took into account comments made by Twitter users and Facebook page owners who claimed to have knowledge about the video. One Twitter user commented that the video was shot in Trinidad and Tobago and was a comedy video created by two professional trainers. The experts considered these comments as additional evidence contradicting the claim.", "Confirmation from the individuals involved": "The experts reached out to one of the individuals seen in the video, Imran, who confirmed that the woman in the video was his wife and that they were both from the same faith. This confirmation from a primary source further discredited the claim of \"love jihad\" being associated with the video."}
