{"The source of the claim": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim about Floyd Mayweather's donation was published by houstonchronicle-tv.com, a website that is not affiliated with the actual Houston Chronicle. This raises doubts about the credibility of the source.", "Misleading URL": "The expert notes that the URL of houstonchronicle-tv.com is misleading, as it is designed to resemble the actual Houston Chronicle's website. This further indicates that the source may not be trustworthy.", "Lack of disclaimer": "The article about Floyd Mayweather's donation did not have any disclaimer, which is unusual for legitimate news sources. This absence of a disclaimer adds to the suspicion surrounding the claim.", "Similarities with other fake news": "The expert also highlights that the website usa360-tv.com, which published the claim about Manny Pacquiao's donation, had a logo similar to that of the New York Daily News. Additionally, both fake news sites used near-identical verbiage in their articles. These similarities suggest a pattern of creating and spreading false information."}
