{"The Galveston program was initiated in 1981 and allowed employees of Galveston County": "as well as those in two adjoining Texas counties, to withdraw from Social Security and establish individual accounts for retirement, survivor, and disability benefits.", "Participants in the Galveston program contribute to their retirement accounts": "which are supplemented by employer contributions. These funds are then invested in annuities through a financial-services company chosen through a county-run bidding process.", "Unlike Social Security": "the benefits provided by the Galveston program are not indexed for inflation. This means that the value of the benefits does not increase over time to keep up with rising costs.", "While participants in the Galveston program have individual accounts": "they do not have control over investment decisions. The program designates a financial-services company to handle the investments on behalf of the participants."}
