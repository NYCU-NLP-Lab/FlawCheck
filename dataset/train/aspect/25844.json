{"The video was digitally manipulated": "The expert's verdict clearly states that the video showing penguins living on an island of plastic is not genuine footage. It was digitally manipulated and originally posted by the World Wildlife Foundation as an April Fool's Day joke.", "Original source and context": "The expert's verdict mentions that the World Wildlife Foundation's original Facebook post linked to an article explaining that the footage was faked. This indicates that the claim was investigated by referring to the original source and understanding the context in which the video was shared.", "Confirmation from the organization": "The expert's verdict includes a statement from the World Wildlife Foundation confirming that the discovery of penguins on the plastic island is not genuine. The organization states that it was a picture montage and emphasizes the seriousness of plastic pollution as a potential hazard.", "Supporting evidence and statistics": "The expert's verdict provides additional information about the issue of plastic pollution in the oceans, including statistics such as the estimated 150 million tons of plastic currently polluting the world's oceans and the projection that by 2050 there will be more plastic in the sea than fish. These facts help to support the conclusion that the claim of penguins living on an island of plastic is not authentic."}
