{"The claim states that the term": "high Crimes and Misdemeanors\" is not defined in the Constitution and does not require corresponding statutory charges. This aspect of the claim is supported by the expert's verdict, which confirms that the term is relatively fluid and has generally been understood as a breach of the public trust.", "The claim suggests that the context of the term implies conduct that violates the public trust": "and this view is echoed by the Framers of the Constitution and early American scholars. The expert's verdict supports this aspect by stating that a high crime is seen as an affront to the state and the public, and breaking the public's trust does not necessarily require breaking a statute.", "The expert": "s verdict provides historical context by explaining that the concept of high crimes and misdemeanors predates the drafting of the Constitution and was often used in impeachments against ministers appointed by monarchs. This aspect highlights the historical origins of the term and its relevance to the framers' discussions on the necessity of an impeachment mechanism."}
