{"The claim was verified by contacting the Warren campaign": "who redirected the experts to a report from the Urban Institute and federal estimates of household out-of-pocket expenses and premium costs over the next decade.", "The Urban Institute report": "although not explicitly mentioning the $11 trillion figure, was deemed to be \"perfectly consistent\" with the analysis by economist Linda Blumberg, who authored the paper.", "The experts found that under the existing health care system": "Americans can expect to pay $11.7 trillion between out-of-pocket costs and premiums over the next decade, based on Urban's model for projecting individual household expenses.", "Other experts": "such as Cynthia Cox from the Kaiser Family Foundation, confirmed that the estimate provided by Urban and used by the Warren campaign is in line with what is known about American health care spending."}
