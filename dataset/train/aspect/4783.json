{"Lack of research": "The expert's claim that an 18-year-old has killed over 100,000 people in video games lacks any supporting research or studies to back it up. Experts in the field have stated that no such research exists.", "Vagueness of the claim": "The claim itself is deemed too vague to determine its accuracy. The spokesperson for the Entertainment Software Association mentioned that it depends on how a game is played and that there is no way to even make an estimate.", "Individual gameplay": "The authenticity of the claim is questioned based on the fact that different individuals play games differently. Some games, like Grand Theft Auto, can be completed without harming or killing anyone, while others may involve more violence. It is argued that it depends on how an individual plays the game.", "Limited data": "While there are statistics available for player-versus-player kills in specific gaming franchises like Halo, it is unclear how these numbers can be extrapolated to estimate the total number of kills by an 18-year-old in video games overall. The data available is limited and does not provide a comprehensive picture."}
