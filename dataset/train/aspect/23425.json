{"Increase in contact with humans": "The expert's verdict mentions that the number of Florida black bears has rebounded in recent years, leading to an increase in contact with humans. This aspect verifies the claim that the bears are not an \"apex predator\" as it suggests they are more likely to interact with humans rather than actively hunt them.", "Opposition to bear hunt": "The expert's verdict highlights the opposition of a Hillsborough County commissioner to declaring open season on Florida black bears. This aspect supports the claim that the bears are not a significant threat as perceived by hunting advocates.", "Bear population in Hillsborough County": "The expert's verdict mentions the statement of Phil Walters, who argued that Hillsborough County didn't have a black bear population, suggesting that passing the resolution against bear hunting was unnecessary. This aspect verifies the claim by questioning the presence of black bears in the county and implying that they are not a top predator.", "Bear diet and hunting behavior": "The expert's verdict includes the statement of Stacy White, the Hillsborough County commissioner, who provided statistics from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission regarding the black bear's diet. The statistics indicate that a black bear's diet primarily consists of plants, insects, and a small percentage of animal matter. This aspect supports the claim that bears do not actively hunt animal prey, further challenging their classification as an \"apex predator.\""}
