{"The claim is based on a TV ad from Democratic presidential candidate Kirsten Gillibrand": "which accuses President Donald Trump of breaking his promise to protect and create manufacturing jobs.", "The ad features a clip of Trump at a rally in Michigan in 2016": "where he promises that manufacturing jobs would stay and even increase if he is elected.", "The claim is supported by an MSNBC segment that reported on the closing of a GM plant in Lordstown": "Ohio, which manufactured the Chevy Cruze. However, the ad leaves the false impression that U.S. manufacturing jobs overall have declined.", "Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that while U": "S. manufacturing is not back to its peak two decades ago, there has been a net increase of nearly 500,000 manufacturing jobs during Trump's presidency. Manufacturing job gains flattened in 2016 but grew by an average of about 19,000 new jobs per month in Trump's first two years in office. The pace of growth has slowed in 2019."}
