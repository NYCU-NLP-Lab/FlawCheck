{"The photograph circulating online captured a price sign for a Shell gas station allegedly located on Crenshaw Boulevard in Los Angeles": "with prices listed at $6.35 a gallon for regular gasoline, $9.73 a gallon for \"plus,\" and $9.83 a gallon for \"V power.\" This visual evidence was used to support the claim.", "An Instagram account also posted the photograph and identified the station as being located on Crenshaw and Jefferson boulevards": "However, when the Shell station near that intersection was contacted, a staff member denied having a car wash on the premises, contradicting the sign's advertisement. This discrepancy raised doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Staff members at two other Shell stations located on Crenshaw Boulevard": "including the one at Rodeo Road, confirmed that they were not charging the prices seen in the photograph. This confirmation from multiple sources further questioned the accuracy of the claim.", "Despite the photograph and social media circulation": "the Gasbuddy.com price tracking site showed that the price per gallon for gasoline in the Los Angeles area did not exceed $4. This reliable source contradicted the claim and provided additional evidence to verify its inaccuracy."}
