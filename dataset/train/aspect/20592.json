{"The historical context": "The expert mentions that Abraham Lincoln and Edgar Allan Poe were contemporaries but never met in real life. This historical fact helps verify the claim's authenticity as it is unlikely for a photograph to exist showing them together.", "The photographic evidence": "The expert refers to a genuine photograph of Abraham Lincoln taken in 1846, which shows him posing alone. This contradicts the claim's assertion of Lincoln posing with Poe, providing evidence against the authenticity of the claim.", "Analysis of the image": "The expert states that the photograph in question is a \"cut-and-paste job\" where the heads of Lincoln and Poe were digitally added to the bodies. This analysis suggests that the image is a manipulated creation rather than an authentic historical photograph.", "Source and context": "The expert mentions that the fake photograph of Lincoln and Poe appeared in a 2010 book called \"Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Hunter,\" which is a work of fiction. This information further discredits the claim's authenticity, as it reveals the image's origin in a fictional context rather than a genuine historical source."}
