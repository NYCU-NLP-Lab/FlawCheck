They highlighted the lack of HIV treatment and prevention, migration patterns, social structures, and cultural practices such as polygamy as potential drivers of the epidemic.", "Comparisons were made between Swaziland and other HIV hotspots": "suggesting that the country's small size may contribute to its top rank among nations with high HIV prevalence.
