{"The expert": "s previous rating: The expert mentions that they had previously looked at a similar claim from Trump in October 2015 and rated it Half True. This indicates that the expert has already examined the claim and has a basis for comparison.", "PolitiFact Virginia": "s recent investigation: The expert refers to PolitiFact Virginia's recent investigation, which found convincing evidence that while companies in the United States assemble televisions from foreign parts, they don't make them. This suggests that PolitiFact Virginia's findings contribute to the verification of the claim.", "Lack of response from the Trump campaign": "The expert mentions that they asked the Trump campaign for the basis of his statement but didn't receive a response. This implies that the expert attempted to gather information from the source of the claim but was unsuccessful, which could be seen as a factor in verifying the claim.", "Testimonies from industry experts": "The expert cites Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, who states that it would be impossible to manufacture a TV in the U.S. without imported parts. This testimony adds credibility to the claim that television sets are not made in the U.S. Additionally, the expert mentions finding three companies that assemble TV components to varying degrees inside the United States, further supporting the claim."}
