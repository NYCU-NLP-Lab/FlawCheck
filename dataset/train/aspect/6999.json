{"The ad released by the Senate Leadership Fund claimed that Claire McCaskill joined the liberals in Washington for giving amnesty to 11 million illegal immigrants without border protections in place": "2. The ad referenced McCaskill's voting record, specifically noting her vote in favor of the 2013 Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act (S. 744), which would have provided a pathway to citizenship for some undocumented immigrants living in America.", "Experts in the field of immigration policy were consulted to determine the accuracy of the claim": "Sarah Pierce, a policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, stated that while she considered the 2013 bill a form of amnesty, she hesitated to use the term due to its heavy criticism in the political environment.", "Critics of the 2013 bill compared it to the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986": "which gave unauthorized immigrants who arrived in the country prior to January 1, 1982, a chance to apply for citizenship. However, the experts noted that the 2013 bill did not provide the same level of benefits as the 1986 act."}
