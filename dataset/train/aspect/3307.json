{"Comparison with other states": "The expert's verdict mentions a 2010 study by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory that ranked North Carolina fifth in terms of offshore wind power potential. This comparison with other states provides a basis for evaluating the claim.", "Potential wind energy capacity": "The expert's verdict highlights that the federal Bureau of Ocean Energy Management has identified three developable sites off the North Carolina coast with a potential wind energy capacity of up to 3,740 megawatts. This indicates the substantial potential for offshore wind power in the state.", "Focus on offshore wind power": "The expert's verdict emphasizes the increasing interest in offshore wind power as a crucial renewable resource, especially considering that winds tend to be stronger and more uniform over water than over land. This aspect supports the claim that North Carolina's coast could be an ideal location for an offshore windfarm.", "Government goals and initiatives": "The expert's verdict mentions that the federal government aims for 20 percent of the country's power to come from wind by 2030 and recognizes offshore wind as a crucial component of the clean energy mix. This aligns with the claim and suggests that there is a broader national push towards offshore wind development."}
