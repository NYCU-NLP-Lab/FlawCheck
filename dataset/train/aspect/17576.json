This aspect emphasizes the questionable credibility of the claim.", "Inaccurate interpretation of data": "The expert clarifies that the original article from The Federalist, which is often cited to support the claim, did not state that 26 out of 27 mass shooters came from fatherless homes. Instead, it mentioned that out of seven shooters under the age of 30, only one was raised by his biological father. This highlights a misinterpretation or misrepresentation of the data.", "Lack of comprehensive data": "The expert mentions that it was difficult to find information on the family background of the other listed mass shooters as it was not readily available from previous studies or databases.
