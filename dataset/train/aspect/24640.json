{"The image in question was posted by Portia de Rossi on her Instagram account on January 3": "2016, during their vacation in Saint Barthelemy.

This connection to a debunked conspiracy theory raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "The post containing the image was flagged by Facebook as part of their efforts to combat false news and misinformation": "This suggests that the claim was deemed to be false or misleading by the platform, further undermining its authenticity."}
