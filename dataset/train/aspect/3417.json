{"The expert referred to a statement made by former Florida Gov": "Jeb Bush at the National Rifle Association's annual convention, where he claimed that Florida has the most concealed weapon permits in the nation, nearly double that of the second state, which is Texas.", "The expert verified the claim by citing an article in the Washington Times from August 2014": "which stated that Florida had 1.3 million concealed carry permits, while Texas had just over 708,000 at that time.", "The expert also looked at a report by the U": "S. Government Accountability Office, which studied the number of active concealed weapons permits by state in 2012. The report found that Florida had the highest number of permits with 887,000, followed by Pennsylvania with 786,000, Georgia with 600,000, and Texas with 519,000.", "To further confirm the claim": "the expert sought more current numbers and found that as of March 2015, Florida had nearly 1.4 million permit holders, while Texas had 825,957 as of December 2014. These numbers were close to the claim of Florida having nearly double the number of permits compared to Texas."}
