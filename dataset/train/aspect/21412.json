{"Comparison of energy sources": "The expert mentions that the claim involves comparing two different energy sources, natural gas and oil, which are measured differently. Oil is measured in barrels, while natural gas is measured in cubic feet.", "Energy content and conversion": "The expert explains that oil and natural gas have different energy content, which means that a conversion is required to compare them. The energy content is converted into British thermal units (BTUs), with 1 trillion cubic feet of natural gas being equivalent to 165 million barrels of crude oil.", "Different measures of availability": "The expert mentions that there are two different ways to measure the availability of oil and natural gas. One approach is to consider proved reserves, which are likely to be developed under current economic and operating conditions. The other approach is to consider technically recoverable resources, which are resources that could be developed in the future but are more uncertain.", "Lack of sources from the claimant": "The expert highlights that the campaign of Jon Huntsman, who made the claim, did not provide any sources to support the claim. This lack of sources makes it difficult to verify the authenticity of the claim."}
