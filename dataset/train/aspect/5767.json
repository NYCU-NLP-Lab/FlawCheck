{"The claim is based on a statement made by news editor Katie Pavlich": "who stated that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) granted itself unprecedented power to shut down businesses for any reason.", "The expert contacted Pavlich for clarification but received no response": "However, Pavlich's article links to a blog post by the Ballard Spahr law firm, which discusses the CFPB adopting a final rule on temporary cease-and-desist orders.", "The expert reached out to Christopher Willis": "a partner at Ballard Spahr and a consumer finance attorney representing financial institutions subject to the rule. Willis explained that a cease-and-desist order is not meant to shut down businesses but to stop them from violating the law.", "The authority for the CFPB to conduct cease": "and-desist proceedings was granted by Congress through Section 1053(c) of the Dodd\u2013Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The CFPB developed an interim rule in 2013 to outline the process for issuing temporary cease-and-desist orders as intended by Congress."}
