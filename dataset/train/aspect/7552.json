{"Expert opinions": "The expert's verdict includes quotes from Richard Aboulafia and Michael O'Hanlon, who both express their disagreement with Paul Ryan's claim. These expert opinions provide a critical perspective on the authenticity of the claim.", "Lack of evidence": "The fact check mentions that Ryan's staff only cited one example from a Fox News article, where spare parts were taken from museum aircraft. However, this example does not provide conclusive evidence that Air Force pilots were regularly going to museums for spare parts. The lack of additional evidence weakens the authenticity of the claim.", "Historical practice": "The fact check mentions that Air Force maintenance workers have a long-standing practice of pulling parts from warehoused planes at the Davis-Monthan Air Force Base. This practice is done to save money and avoid delays in waiting for new parts to be made. This historical practice contradicts the claim that pilots were specifically going to museums for spare parts.", "Previous fact check": "The fact check refers to a previous fact check conducted by PolitiFact Texas in July 2016. Although this fact check did not directly address the claim about pilots going to museums, it did provide information about the practice of pulling parts from warehoused planes. This previous fact check adds context and further undermines the authenticity of the claim."}
