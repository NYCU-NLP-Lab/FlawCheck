It was observed that during the first 10 minutes, 14 people shook Francis's hand without bowing down to kiss his ring, while 41 people made the symbolic gesture of kissing his ring or actually kissed the ring itself. This observation supports the claim made in the video.", "Experts": "including medieval church history scholar Christopher Bellitto and Vatican journalist John Allen, stated that kissing the pope's ring was once a common practice but has been moving away from symbols of subservience in recent times. This information aligns with the actions shown in the video, where Pope Francis withdrew his hand as people attempted to kiss his ring.", "The video was promoted by some comedians who had previously created fake videos involving Pope Francis": "However, the expert's verdict confirms that this particular video was genuine and not a hoax.
