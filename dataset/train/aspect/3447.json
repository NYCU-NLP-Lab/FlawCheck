This suggests that the claim of the image being related to recent protests and the penalty imposed by the UP government is not authentic.", "The image has been shared on social media": "The expert's verdict mentions that the image has been circulating on social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter. This indicates that the claim has gained traction and has been widely shared, but it doesn't necessarily verify the authenticity of the claim.", "The image has been shared by a person associated with Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh": "RSS): The expert's verdict notes that the image was shared by Pavan Kharab, who claims to be associated with RSS. This information provides context about the source of the claim and the potential motivations behind its dissemination. However, it doesn't directly verify the authenticity of the claim.", "The image was tweeted by a Pakistani": "Canadian author: The expert's verdict mentions that the same image was tweeted by Tarek Fatah, a Pakistani-Canadian author, with a different message. This suggests that the image has been used in different contexts and narratives, which raises questions about its authenticity and the claims made about it.
