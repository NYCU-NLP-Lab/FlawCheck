{"Comments on the Facebook post were mixed": "with some users believing the picture was taken in Durban, South Africa, while another user cast doubt on the photo by noting that the nationality of the people seemed more Asian.", "A reverse image search conducted by a user led to the discovery of three links related to India": "suggesting that the post was misleading. One of the links included an article from 2017 on an Indian website, OfficeChai, which featured the same photo and described it as showing a State Bank of India cashier playing a card game on her computer as customers waited in line.", "The image was found posted on Imgur in 2012 and discussed in a Reddit post that claimed it was taken at a vehicle registration office in India": "However, other Reddit users correctly pointed out that it was not taken at a vehicle registration office.", "Several distinctive elements in the photo": "such as markings on the back of the woman's chair and a pale blue booklet propped up on the counter, were recognized by Reddit users as being associated with the State Bank of India. Online searches of these elements further supported the connection to India. Additionally, a Bailley water bottle produced by Parl\u00e9 Agro in India could be seen on the window counter in the photo."}
