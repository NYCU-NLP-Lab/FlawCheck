{"Multiple tweets and publications": "The claim was reported by multiple sources, including Bangalore Mirror, ANI, Zee Salaam, Times of India, News9, and Mirror Now. This indicates that the information was widely circulated.", "Deletion of tweets": "Both Bangalore Mirror and Sridhar Vivan, the Metro Editor, deleted their tweets containing the claim. This raises questions about the authenticity of the information they initially shared.", "Identification of location discrepancy": "Several users pointed out that the photograph used to support the claim was actually taken in Kasara on the Mumbai-Nashik expressway, not in Nippani, Karnataka. This indicates a clear discrepancy between the claimed location and the actual location depicted in the image.", "Alternative evidence": "Other photographs taken at the same spot but from different angles were published, showing the same restaurant advertisement visible on a wall. These photographs further support the argument that the original image was taken in Maharashtra, not in Karnataka."}
