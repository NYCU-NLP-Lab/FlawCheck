{"Social media posts": "The expert's verdict mentions that several social media users posted an image of a sealed pack of a Pfizer coronavirus vaccine that claimed it was \"Made in China.\" These posts were used as evidence to verify the authenticity of the claim.", "News website reports": "The viral image was published by several news websites, including Lokmat English, TFI Post, Siasat Daily, and The India Print. These reports, except the last one, were attributed to IANS. The inclusion of these reports supports the claim's authenticity.", "Humorous text on the image": "The text below the Pfizer logo on the viral image reads, \"Makers of 'The Boner Pill',\" which suggests that the image was humorously made. Reuters also pointed out this aspect, indicating that the image may not be genuine.", "Confirmation from Pfizer": "Reuters contacted Pfizer and received an email confirmation that the vaporizer cartridge mentioned in the viral image was fake. This direct communication with Pfizer adds credibility to the claim's inauthenticity."}
