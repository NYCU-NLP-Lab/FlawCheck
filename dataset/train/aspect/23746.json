{"Lengthy circulating lists": "The expert mentions that multiple versions of lengthy lists of deaths associated with Bill Clinton have been circulating online for about twenty years. These lists claim that close to fifty individuals connected to Clinton died in suspicious circumstances.", "Lack of evidence": "The expert highlights that despite the claims made in these lists, there is no direct evidence linking Bill Clinton or his associates to the deaths. The expert mentions that investigations by respected news outlets have found nothing to substantiate the claims.", "Origin of the claims": "The expert provides information about the origins of the claims, mentioning a 1994 letter by former Rep. William Dannemeyer, who listed 24 people with connections to Clinton who had died under suspicious circumstances. The expert also mentions a list called \"The Clinton Body Count\" created by Linda Thompson, which contained the names of 34 individuals she believed had died suspiciously.", "Lack of credibility and logical reasoning": "The expert points out the lack of credibility in attributing any unexplained death to President Clinton by inventing a connection between him and the victim. The expert uses the example of Mary Mahoney, who once worked as an intern at the White House, to illustrate that there is no credible reason why she would be the target of a Clinton-directed killing. The expert also mentions that very few interns have contact with the President, making it unlikely for them to be targeted in such a manner."}
