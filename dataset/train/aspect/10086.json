{"Lack of evidence for millions of people voting multiple times": "The expert's verdict states that there is no evidence to support the claim that millions of people have voted multiple times. National experts have stated that voter fraud, including double voting, is isolated and rare.", "Double voting is different from being registered in multiple states": "The expert explains that double voting refers to a person casting more than one ballot in an election, while being registered in multiple states often happens when people move. The fact that approximately 2.75 million people have registrations in more than one state does not mean that they actually voted more than once.", "Prevalence of double voting in the 2012 presidential election": "The expert mentions a research paper published by a group of experts from Stanford and University of Pennsylvania. The paper estimated that there were around 33,000 double voters in the 130 million ballots cast in the 2012 presidential election, even if no actual double votes were cast. This suggests that the prevalence of double voting is relatively low.", "Difficulty in detecting double voting across state lines": "The expert explains that double voting is hard to detect because voting records cannot be easily linked across state lines. The coordination of registration records across states, like the Interstate Crosscheck Program, aims to address this challenge. However, the expert highlights that even with a large number of vote records, the chances of two ballots cast under the same name and birthdate belonging to different people are surprisingly high."}
