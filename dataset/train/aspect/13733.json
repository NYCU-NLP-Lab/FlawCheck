{"U": "S. Agriculture Department Secretary Sonny Perdue's statement: The expert refers to the statement made by Secretary Perdue in a USDA press release on July 26, where he claims that \"America\u2019s hard-working agricultural producers have been treated unfairly by China\u2019s illegal trading practices and have taken a disproportionate hit when it comes to illegal retaliatory tariffs.\" This statement serves as the basis for investigating the authenticity of the claim.", "Proportion of agricultural exports facing retaliatory tariffs": "The Agriculture Department highlights that 37 percent of U.S. exports facing retaliatory tariffs are agricultural exports. This figure is calculated using official import customs data from the retaliating partner through a private third party, Global Trade Atlas. This aspect provides evidence of the impact of retaliatory tariffs on agricultural producers.", "Disproportionate representation of agricultural goods in total exports": "According to USDA's 2017 data, agricultural goods account for about 10 percent of total U.S. exports. This percentage is significantly lower than the 37 percent of agricultural exports facing retaliatory tariffs. The expert points out that this disproportionality supports the claim that agricultural producers have taken a disproportionate hit.", "Dependence of the agricultural industry on world markets": "The expert mentions that the agricultural industry is on average more dependent on world markets compared to other industries. Exports comprise about 20 percent of GDP in the American agricultural sector, whereas they only comprise 10 percent of total GDP in the United States. This aspect demonstrates the vulnerability of agricultural producers to trade conflicts and further supports the claim of a disproportionate hit on the industry."}
