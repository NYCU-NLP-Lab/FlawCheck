{"Comparison of bridge space allocation": "The expert compared the claim that 60 percent of the bridge space is allocated to satisfy two percent of all travelers with the actual breakdown provided by the county, which states that by square footage, the allocation is 49 percent for vehicles and 51 percent for bicyclists and pedestrians.", "Analysis of bridge usage": "The expert analyzed the claim that cars carry nearly 98 percent of all passenger-trips during peak hours. This analysis would involve gathering data on the actual percentage of car usage during peak hours and comparing it to the claim made in the essay.", "Evaluation of the need for bridge space": "The expert assessed the claim that there is no reason to allocate 60 percent of the bridge space to satisfy two percent of all travelers. This evaluation would involve considering the importance and necessity of providing adequate space for non-motorized transportation, such as bikeways and sidewalks, and weighing it against the needs of vehicular travel.", "Verification of data sources": "The expert would verify the sources of information used in the claim and the counter-arguments. This would involve fact-checking the information provided by the Cascade Policy Institute, the county's website, and any other relevant sources to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data used in the claim."}
