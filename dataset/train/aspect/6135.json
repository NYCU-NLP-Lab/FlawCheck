This raises doubts about the credibility of the claim.", "Lack of official confirmation": "The expert's verdict states that the Italian National Prosecutor's Office did not confirm the arrest and charges against Pope Francis. This indicates that there is no official verification of the claim.", "Contradictory evidence": "The expert's verdict highlights that Pope Francis made a public appearance at his official residence on the same day the claim was made. Video footage of this appearance was also available, contradicting the claim of his arrest and detention.", "Baseless conspiracy theories": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim was linked to existing conspiracy theories involving the Italian government, former President Barack Obama, and fraudulent manipulation of the U.S. presidential election results. This association with baseless theories further undermines the authenticity of the claim."}
