{"Lack of credible sources": "The expert's investigation revealed that there were no credible sources or publications, such as the Moscow Times or the Moscow Faculty of Sciences, that reported on the claimed discovery. This lack of verifiable sources raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Inconsistent and questionable web sources": "The claim appeared on multiple web sites of questionable repute, which further undermines its credibility. These sites did not provide any substantial evidence or reliable information to support the claim.", "Misrepresentation of accompanying photograph": "The photograph that accompanied the claim was found to be misrepresented. It was originally posted on Reddit in 2012 as an image warning about the dangers of falling asleep at the beach, indicating that it had no connection to the claimed discovery. This misrepresentation raises concerns about the validity of the claim.", "Lack of scientific evidence and plausibility": "The chemical process described in the claim, involving oxytane and benzodiazepine, is not supported by any scientific evidence. Moreover, oxytane is a fuel additive, not a skin whitening agent, while benzodiazepines are sedative drugs with no known effects on skin. This lack of scientific plausibility further casts doubt on the authenticity of the claim."}
