{"Contradiction with CDC director and government officials": "The expert's verdict highlights that President Trump's claim contradicts the statements made by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) director and other government officials. They state that a coronavirus vaccine will not be immediately available to the general public after authorization, as claimed by Trump.", "Limited availability in 2020": "The expert's verdict mentions that officials expect only a limited number of vaccine doses to be available in 2020. These doses will be prioritized for specific groups, indicating that the general public may not have access to the vaccine until well into 2021.", "Lack of evidence for distribution of 100 million doses": "President Trump claimed, without evidence, that the U.S. would be able to distribute at least 100 million vaccine doses by the end of 2020. The expert's verdict highlights this claim as being unsupported by evidence.", "Conflicting statements on immediate distribution": "The expert's verdict points out the inconsistency in President Trump's statements regarding immediate distribution of the vaccine. While he initially claimed that the vaccine would be available immediately, he later acknowledged that it may be available from mid-October onwards, but possibly even later. This conflicting information raises doubts about the accuracy of his claim."}
