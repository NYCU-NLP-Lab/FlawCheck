{"The claim is supported by a tweet from U": "S. Senator Marco Rubio, who stated that the Broward elections department has a history of violating the law. This tweet serves as evidence of the claim's authenticity.", "Two lawsuits filed against the Broward elections department since 2016 are mentioned": "One lawsuit was filed by Tim Canova after he lost a Democratic primary, alleging that the department refused to allow him to inspect the paper ballots. The other lawsuit was filed by the Republican Party of Florida, claiming that the department had improper procedures for opening mail-in ballots. These lawsuits provide further evidence of potential violations of the law by the Broward elections department.", "The verdict mentions a Broward judge ruling against Brenda Snipes": "the Broward County Supervisor of Elections, for the premature destruction of records, which was deemed unlawful and in violation of the Public Records Act. This ruling confirms that there have been legal violations within the department.", "The verdict also mentions a federal judge siding with Snipes in a lawsuit brought by the American Civil Rights Union": "concluding that Snipes made reasonable efforts to purge ineligible voters from the rolls. Although this ruling does not directly relate to the claim of violating the law, it provides context and balance to the overall assessment of the Broward elections department's actions."}
