{"The number of registered voters for the 2020 election was estimated to be well above 200 million": "according to experts from various sources, including the Center for Election Innovation and Research, World Population Review, and the United States Election Project.", "The claim that there were only 133 million registered voters is contradicted by the fact that in the 2016 election": "there were 138,846,571 ballots cast, which indicates a higher number of registered voters.", "Different states manage their own voter rolls": "and the numbers can change as voters register, move to another state, or pass away. Some states even allow voters to register on Election Day, making it difficult to pinpoint the exact number of registered voters.", "The gold standard of turnout statistics": "the United States Election Project, reported that 159,690,457 ballots were counted in the November 2020 election, including 158,254,475 that contained votes for president, further supporting the higher number of votes cast compared to the claim."}
