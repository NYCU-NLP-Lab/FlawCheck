{"Lack of credible sources": "The expert's verdict highlights that there are no credible sources or evidence authenticating the claim made by the Facebook vice president Jeff Rothschild. The anonymous author of the post on the underground anarchist blog did not provide any sources to support the statements.", "Inconsistent statements": "The expert's verdict mentions that there is no record of Jeff Rothschild making any statements about a New World Order, a third world war, or a globalized feudal system in any public statements over the past two decades. This inconsistency raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Discrepancies in event location": "The expert's verdict reveals that although Jeff Rothschild did speak at a conference of Chinese and American entrepreneurs and investors in Santa Clara, California, there is no evidence of him speaking about the New World Order or a third world war. The claim misrepresents the location and context of his speech.", "Lack of evidence and reliance on conspiracy theories": "The expert's verdict highlights the lack of evidence supporting the claim. The quote attributed to Jeff Rothschild has been widely circulated in internet memes and conspiracy theories but lacks any substantial proof. The response from conspiracy theorists that \"where is the evidence he didn't say it?\" demonstrates a low evidentiary standard and reliance on unfounded claims."}
