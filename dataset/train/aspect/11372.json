{"Comparison of historical data": "The expert examined spending numbers dating back to 1960 and averaged the two-year increases for the general fund between 1965 and 2003. This allowed them to verify the claim that the average two-year increase in Minnesota state spending until 2003 was 21.09 percent.", "Analysis of year": "to-year changes: The expert analyzed the year-over-year change in the budget from 2004 to 2011, during Tim Pawlenty's tenure as governor. They averaged the year-to-year changes and found an average increase of 1.64 percent, which closely aligned with Pawlenty's claim of reducing spending to about 1.7 percent per year.", "Comparison of different time frames": "The expert noted that Pawlenty compared two-year increments (pre-2003) with one-year increments (post-2003), which could make the difference in spending growth seem more dramatic. They calculated the two-year average increase to be 3.53 percent, slightly higher than the one-year average.", "Examination of budget forecasts and mechanisms": "The expert considered the state budget agency's forecasts, which showed a projected increase of 27 percent in spending over the next two years as Pawlenty was leaving office. They also mentioned the mechanisms used to reduce state spending, such as utilizing funds from the federal stimulus and delaying shifts in spending on K-12 education. This provided additional context to the claim and highlighted the criticism from Pawlenty's opponents regarding the sustainability of the spending reductions."}
