The decline in U.S. fossil fuel exports and changes in energy trends were primarily caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, not the actions of any U.S. president.", "The conservative group Turning Point USA created a meme that falsely portrays Joe Biden": "s policies as the cause of the decline in energy independence. The meme ignores the fact that President Donald Trump was in office in 2020 when these changes occurred.", "The claim that 2019 was the first year the United States achieved energy independence since 1957 is true": "but it is important to understand the definition of \"energy independence.\" It means that the U.S. produced more energy than it consumed, but it does not imply a complete absence of importing foreign oil or reliance on foreign energy sources.", "The energy independence experienced in 2019 was driven by record levels of total fossil fuel exports from the U": "S., which had been a long-term trend since 2006 and 2008. Domestic crude oil and natural gas production had been increasing during this period."}
