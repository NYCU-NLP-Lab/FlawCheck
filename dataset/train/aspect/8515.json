{"The timing of the decision": "The expert points out that Harley-Davidson announced the closure of at least one US factory and the opening of a manufacturing plant in Thailand before President Trump imposed tariffs on imported steel. This suggests that the decision was not directly influenced by the steel tariffs as claimed in the viral post.", "Previous business decisions": "The expert highlights that the closure of the Kansas City plant was planned since 2015, before President Trump took office. This indicates that the decision was not a direct response to the steel tariffs but rather a part of Harley-Davidson's long-term strategy to consolidate manufacturing operations.", "Confusion in media reporting": "The expert mentions that the viral Facebook post was based on a MSNBC segment that did not clearly state that the Kansas City plant closure was announced before President Trump's tariff decision. This confusion in reporting may have led to the misinterpretation of the events and the false claim made in the post.", "Sales decline and business challenges": "The expert acknowledges that Harley-Davidson has faced challenges in terms of declining sales and the need to address these issues. While the steel tariffs may have added to the company's concerns, they are not directly linked to the decision to close the Wisconsin plant or the consolidation of manufacturing operations in Kansas City."}
