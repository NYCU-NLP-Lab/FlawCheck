["Is This an Outtake from the Apollo 11 Moon Landing?", "An unearthed video clip appears to show a studio-produced 'outtake' of the first\nmanned moon landing.", "A less elaborate video twist on the moon landing hoax was featured at\n   moontruth.com, where web surfers could view a re-creation (or perhaps we\n   should say \u201cpre-creation\u201d) of the first moon landing, purportedly filmed\n   in 1965; the footage is revealed to be studio fakery when a bank of arc\n   lights breaks loose, intruding into the shot sending the film crew\n   swarming onto the set to prepare for another \u201ctake.\u201d\n\n   Many people inquired of us whether the (fictional) backstory given on\n   moontruth.com about the video clip was real.", "(Presumably they didn\u2019t all\n   believe the moon landings were faked and instead were questioning whether\n   some \u201crehearsals\u201d might have been filmed by NASA for whatever reasons, as\n   implied in the site\u2019s disclaimer \u201cThere is no proof that because this was\n   shot in a studio, the moon landing was necessarily faked.\u201d) For them we\n   note that at least two humorous aspects of the clip (inserted\n   intentionally or otherwise) give it away as a post-Apollo fabrication:\n\n   1) The \u201castronaut\u201d in the clip flubs the \u201cOne small step \u2026\u201d line (by\n   omitting the word \u201ca\u201d between the words \u201cfor\u201d and \u201cman\u201d) just as Neil\n   Armstrong did during the real Apollo 11 moon landing in July 1969."]
