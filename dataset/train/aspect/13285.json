{"Lack of evidence": "The expert's verdict states that there is no evidence to support the claim that Betsy DeVos said \"only\" 0.02% of children are likely to die from schools reopening during the pandemic. This lack of evidence undermines the authenticity of the claim.", "Fictitious quote": "The expert's verdict highlights that the claim circulating on social media is a fictitious quote attributed to DeVos. This suggests that the claim is not based on any factual statement made by DeVos.", "Inability to find public comments": "The expert's investigation failed to find any public comments or interviews where DeVos made the specific remark mentioned in the claim. This further casts doubt on the authenticity of the claim.", "Contradictory statements": "The expert's verdict mentions that while DeVos advocated for schools to reopen, she did not mention the specific statistic of 0.02% or make any remarks about the likelihood of children dying from COVID-19. This contradiction between the claim and DeVos's actual statements adds to the skepticism surrounding the claim's authenticity."}
