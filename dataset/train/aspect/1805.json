{"Analysis by the Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources": "DOER): The expert's verdict mentions that the senators cited an analysis by the DOER, which stated that it is unclear to what extent the LNG supply from Weaver Cove is needed to meet the region's gas supply needs. This analysis provides insight into the current gas supply situation in New England.", "Completion of new or expanded LNG facilities in the Northeast": "The expert's verdict mentions that within the past year, two new or expanded LNG facilities were completed in the Northeast, adding to the large excess supply already in the natural gas market. This indicates that there has been an increase in gas supply in the region.", "Other increased supplies and drop in demand for natural gas": "The expert's verdict mentions that the senators cited other increased supplies and a drop in demand for natural gas. These changes in the region's electricity and natural gas marketplace since the initiation of the Weaver's Cove project suggest that there may not be a demand for additional LNG infrastructure.", "Projection of national natural gas demand": "The expert's verdict mentions that Damien Gaul, an analyst for the Energy Information Administration, referred to a recent administration projection showing national natural gas demand increasing. Although the specific details of the projection are not provided, it suggests that there is a growing demand for natural gas at a national level, which may have implications for the gas supply in New England."}
