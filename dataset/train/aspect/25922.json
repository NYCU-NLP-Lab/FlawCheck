{"The direct quote from Hillary Clinton": "The expert's verdict mentions that Donald Trump claimed Hillary Clinton said the veterans' issue was \"over-exaggerated\" and that she was satisfied with what was going on in the Veterans Administration. The expert's verdict provides evidence of this claim by quoting Trump's statement and mentioning that host Matt Lauer corrected him by stating that Clinton had actually laid out a litany of problems within the VA.", "Context and timing of Clinton": "s statement: The expert's verdict mentions that the 16-second clip provided doesn't provide much context of what Clinton said before the quote about veterans being satisfied with their treatment. However, it also mentions that there were multiple media reports on extended wait times for veterans and that Clinton received criticism for downplaying the issue. This suggests that the timing and context of Clinton's statement were important aspects considered to verify the claim.", "Clinton": "s overall stance on the VA issue: The expert's verdict mentions that Trump's campaign pointed to a Wall Street Journal article where Clinton said, \"It's not been as widespread as it has been made out to be\" regarding problems at the Veterans Affairs Department. This indicates that Clinton's overall stance on the VA issue was taken into account to verify the claim.", "Surveys and satisfaction of treated veterans": "The expert's verdict quotes Clinton from an interview where she mentioned that overall, veterans who do get treated are satisfied with their treatment, based on surveys. This aspect of Clinton's statement, along with the mention of constant berating of the VA in the media, suggests that the satisfaction of treated veterans and the existence of surveys were considered to verify the claim."}
