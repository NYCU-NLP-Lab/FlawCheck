{"The claim was made by Florida State Rep": "Matt Caldwell, who stated that \"A law enforcement officer is more likely to commit a crime than a CWP (concealed weapons permit) holder.\"", "The source of Caldwell": "s claim is most likely John Lott, head of the Crime Prevention Research Center, who has written extensively on gun-related issues and conducted number-crunching analysis.", "Lott compared the rate of crimes committed by police nationwide to permit revocations in Texas": "Florida, and Michigan in 2015. He used data on police crime from a national search of news reports conducted by a team at Bowling Green State University.", "However": "Lott's analysis was criticized by Philip Stinson, a criminal justice professor at Bowling Green State University, who pointed out that Lott failed to consider that the number of cases reported does not necessarily reflect the number of individual officers involved in crimes. Stinson also questioned Lott's use of permit revocations as a measure of crimes by permit holders, stating that it undercounts the true number of infractions."}
