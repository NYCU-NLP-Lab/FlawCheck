{"Assembly Speaker Robin Vos": "s statement: Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester) claims that his support for a private bail system and bounty hunters in Wisconsin is a fiscal matter. He believes that a private bail system can guarantee that defendants show up for court, leading to more effective and efficient courts and potentially reducing costs for taxpayers.", "Reference to a study by WPRI": "Vos mentions a study conducted by the Wisconsin Policy Research Institute (WPRI), a conservative think-tank based in Hartland. The study, titled \"Should Wisconsin Allow Commercial Bail in Pretrial Release?\" and authored by Kate Lind, concluded that Wisconsin has a higher no-show rate than other states. The study reviewed various studies on bail and was commissioned by WPRI.", "Comparison with other states": "Vos states that Wisconsin is one of only two or four states that currently do not have bail bonds. He suggests that implementing a private bail system, similar to other states, could potentially reduce the no-show rate and enhance public safety.", "Arguments from bail companies and critics": "Bail companies argue that their work does not require taxpayer funding and can lower the number of no-shows, thereby enhancing public safety. On the other hand, critics argue that a private bail system imposes an unfair monetary burden on lower-income individuals and that elected judges should have more control over pretrial release decisions."}
