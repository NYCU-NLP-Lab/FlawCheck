{"The claim was initially made by a Twitter handle named Know Legacy of All India Mahila Congress": "which posted a photograph of Indira Gandhi and Kiran Bedi along with a message claiming that Gandhi had invited Bedi for lunch after she booked the Prime Minister's vehicle for illegal parking.", "The claim was further supported by other individuals on Twitter who shared the same photograph and reiterated the story of Gandhi inviting Bedi for lunch to honor her commitment towards duty": "3. Alt News, a fact-checking website, found that the photograph was taken out of context. It was actually from a meeting when Gandhi had invited Bedi for breakfast after seeing her lead the Republic Day parade in 1975. Bedi herself had tweeted the photograph in 2014, confirming its authenticity.", "Kiran Bedi was popularly referred to as": "Crane Bedi\" in the past, with claims that she personally towed Indira Gandhi's car. However, Bedi clarified in an interview that it was actually SI Nirmal Singh who towed the car, and she was the Deputy Commissioner of Police, Traffic in Delhi at the time of the incident."}
