{"The claim falsely states that U": "S. President Joe Biden signed an executive order giving China access to or control over the U.S. power grid system, causing the Texas power outage in February 2021.", "The expert": "s investigation revealed that Biden did not sign any executive order granting China access to or control over the U.S. power grid system. Instead, he signed an executive order suspending a previous order by his predecessor, Donald Trump, which barred the installation of equipment purchased from foreign adversaries into electrical infrastructure. This suspension was intended to allow Biden's administration officials to evaluate Trump's order.", "The expert explains that the U": "S. power grid system consists of three main grids: one connecting the western half of the U.S. and western Canada, another connecting the eastern half of the U.S. and eastern Canada, and a third grid serving most of Texas. These grids, along with a fourth grid serving Quebec, are collectively known as the bulk-power system (BPS).", "The expert also mentions that Trump had previously signed an executive order in May 2020 titled": "Securing the United States Bulk-Power System,\" which prohibited the purchase and use of electrical equipment for the bulk-power system from foreign adversaries. This order aimed to mitigate the potential threat of cyberattacks on U.S. electrical systems. Furthermore, Trump's secretary of energy issued a prohibition order in December 2020, specifically prohibiting utilities supplying critical defense facilities from procuring certain BPS electric equipment from China due to the perceived risk it posed to the BPS, critical infrastructure, national security, and safety."}
