{"The claim that Georgia was": "dead last in education\" when Roy Barnes was governor was verified by examining a Manhattan Institute report published in 2001, which found that Georgia had the lowest high school graduation rate of any state. However, it was noted that the report was about students who graduated in 1998, the year before Barnes took office.", "The second claim that Georgia": "led the nation in job losses\" was not specifically addressed in the expert's verdict. Therefore, it is unclear how this aspect was verified or if it was verified at all.", "The expert": "s verdict mentions that AJC PolitiFact Georgia previously ruled a claim that Barnes \"created\" 235,000 jobs as governor as Half True in June. This suggests that the claim about job creation during Barnes' tenure as governor has been fact-checked and evaluated.", "The Barnes camp responded to the claims made by the Republican Governors Association with their own ad": "which stated that Barnes \"brought in 235,000 jobs as governor\" and reduced classroom sizes. While it is not explicitly mentioned in the expert's verdict, it can be inferred that these claims were also fact-checked and evaluated by AJC PolitiFact Georgia."}
