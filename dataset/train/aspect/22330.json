{"The expert": "s verdict highlights the projections from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) that contradict the claim made by Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney. The CBO projected that there would have been hundreds of billions of dollars in deficits each year from 2018 to 2027 under President Trump's proposed budget for fiscal year 2018.", "The Office of Management and Budget": "OMB) projected that Trump's budget would add $3.2 trillion to the deficit over a 10-year period, while the CBO estimated that deficits would increase by $6.8 trillion. This discrepancy in projections indicates that the claim of being on a glide path to balancing the budget is not accurate.", "The expert also mentions Mulvaney": "s statement on CNN's \"State of the Union\" where he claimed that if Congress had adopted the president's budgets over the last two years, the deficit and debt would be lower, and the country would be on a glide path to balancing the budget. However, the expert refutes this claim by stating that the budget proposed by Trump would not come close to being balanced, as confirmed by the CBO.", "The expert points out that while Trump": "s OMB estimated that his 2018 budget would reduce projected deficits by $5.6 trillion over 10 years, the CBO, using different economic assumptions, reached a different conclusion. The CBO stated that Trump's plan would increase deficits and debt less than current law but not to the extent projected by the OMB. This discrepancy in estimates further undermines the authenticity of the claim."}
