{"The claim made by Lt": "Gov. Dan Forest is based on his assumption that once HB2 is repealed, cities and counties will rush to pass transgender-friendly bathroom rules.", "The claim implies that Gov": "Cooper's proposed bill will create a state-sanctioned 'Look But Don't Touch' policy in bathrooms, allowing heterosexual men to access women's showers and bathrooms by posing as transgender individuals.", "The claim suggests that under this policy": "men would be able to watch women and children shower or shower next to them without legal protection for the offended woman or child, as long as there is no physical assault, harassment, or filming involved.", "The expert": "s verdict highlights that the claim is not based on the actual bill itself, but on Forest's interpretation of Cooper's proposal, which aims to repeal HB2 and strengthen criminal penalties for certain crimes committed in bathrooms."}
