{"The claim was made by State Rep": "Dale Kooyenga, R-Brookfield, who stated that Wisconsin has \"the number one health care system in the country\" and that \"everyone in poverty now has health care.\"", "The claim was supported by a previous PolitiFact Wisconsin item from September 2": "2015, which rated a similar claim made by Gov. Scott Walker. The item noted that 145,000 people gained coverage as a result of actions taken by Walker, and Wisconsin is the only state without a coverage gap among those that did not do the Obamacare expansion.", "Rachel Vander Wiele": "a staffer for Kooyenga, also cited a November 1, 2017, news item from the University of Wisconsin-Madison Department of Medicine, which stated that Wisconsin had the best health care quality in the nation according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). However, it was mentioned that this information is outdated, and in the latest report released in September 2018, Maine ranked first and Wisconsin came in fourth.", "Stephanie Marquis": "vice president of communications for the Wisconsin Hospital Association, acknowledged that Wisconsin has generally fared well in the AHRQ rankings, ranking first in the nation in 2006, 2008, and 2017, and second in 2007, 2009, and 2010."}
