{"Redistricting": "The expert mentions that redistricting resulted in Rep. Marcy Kaptur and Rep. Dennis Kucinich being placed in the same new 9th Congressional House District. This information helps verify the claim about Kaptur's residency.", "Legal requirements": "The expert explains that members of the House are not constitutionally required to live in the districts they represent, but only to be an \"inhabitant\" of the state. This information supports the claim that the location of residency doesn't matter legally.", "Ad from a political action committee": "The expert mentions that a 30-second cable TV ad paid by the Campaign for Primary Accountability accuses Kaptur of living in a fancy condo in the Washington, D.C. suburbs. This ad provides evidence for the claim about Kaptur's residency.", "Supporting evidence": "The Campaign for Primary Accountability provided a copy of Kaptur's property assessment by the city of Alexandria, VA, and copies of site-search data from the Lucas County auditor in Ohio. This evidence supports the claim made in the ad and adds credibility to the authenticity of the claim."}
