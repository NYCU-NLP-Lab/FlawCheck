{"Comparison between Obama and Bush": "One aspect employed to verify the authenticity of the claim is comparing the rate of nominee confirmations between President Obama and President Bush during their second terms. McConnell stated that Obama was getting his nominees confirmed faster than Bush was at the same time in his second term.", "Focus on judicial nominations": "Another aspect considered was the specific type of nominations being discussed. McConnell's office clarified that the comparison between Obama and Bush's nominee confirmations was specifically referring to judges. This aspect helped determine the accuracy of the claim in relation to judicial nominations.", "Examination of nomination numbers": "The expert's analysis involved examining the actual numbers of confirmed nominees for both presidents. By searching the nominations database at the Library of Congress, it was found that the Senate had confirmed 68 of Obama's nominees by the time McConnell was interviewed. In comparison, during the same point in Bush's second term, the Senate had confirmed 129 of his nominees. This aspect provided concrete data to evaluate the claim's accuracy.", "Comparison of overall nomination confirmations": "Additionally, the expert's analysis considered the overall number of nominations confirmed in the first year of the second terms for both presidents. It was found that the Senate had confirmed a total of 68 of Obama's nominees, while the Senate had confirmed nearly twice as many, 129, of Bush's nominees during the same period. This aspect further supported the conclusion that Obama's nominees were not being confirmed faster than Bush's at the same point in their second terms."}
