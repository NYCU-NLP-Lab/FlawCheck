{"Lack of historical evidence": "The expert points out that there is no record of Al Capone ever making the quote in question. This lack of evidence casts doubt on the authenticity of the claim.", "Historical context": "The expert explains that the claim doesn't make historical sense because Al Capone died in 1947, before the Chicago Cubs' reputation for World Series futility was established. The Cubs had actually won two World Series and ten pennants during Capone's lifetime.", "Joke origin": "The expert reveals that the quote was actually a joke that originated after the Cubs won their first World Series in over a century in 2016. The quote was a humorous way of highlighting the unlikely nature of a woman being elected president.", "Similar quotes": "The expert mentions that similar quotes connecting the Cubs to Hillary Clinton were circulated after the Cubs' 2016 World Series victory. This suggests that the claim may have been a recurring joke or meme rather than something attributed to Al Capone."}
