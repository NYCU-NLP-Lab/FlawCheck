{"The claim is based on a graphic released by UltraViolet": "a liberal group, which asserts that Paul Ryan would \"outlaw in vitro fertilization.\" This graphic is cited as the primary evidence for the claim.", "The graphic references the Sanctity of Human Life Act": "a bill that Ryan co-sponsored but which remains stalled in the House. The bill defines \"human\" and \"human being\" to include all members of the species homo sapiens at all stages of life, beginning with fertilization. This definition could potentially be interpreted to include embryos used in in vitro fertilization.", "The bill asserts that the right to life guaranteed by the Constitution is vested in each human being": "and that every human being shall have all the legal and constitutional attributes and privileges of personhood from the moment of fertilization. This language suggests a potential conflict with the legality of in vitro fertilization, as it could be argued that the creation and manipulation of embryos in the process violates the rights of those embryos.", "It is important to note that the bill has not been passed or enacted into law": "and therefore its potential impact on the legality of in vitro fertilization remains speculative. The fact that the bill is stalled in the House indicates that it has not received widespread support or consensus among lawmakers."}
