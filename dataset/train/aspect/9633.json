{"Geolocation of the photograph": "The expert verified the authenticity of the claim by conducting a keyword search and finding the full image shared on a blog on September 25. The image showed several shops in the background, which helped geolocate the area where the photograph was taken. It was determined that the photograph was taken at Kalindi Kunj road in Delhi's Shaheen Bagh.", "Verification of the presence of makeshift tents": "The expert contacted a local shop owner, Manish Jain, from Factory Price Shop located in the same lane as the photograph. Jain confirmed that there were no makeshift tents in Shaheen Bagh at the time and mentioned that the police were not permitting any protests at the site since the COVID-19 pandemic. This information debunked the claim that the photograph was related to the ongoing farmers' protest.", "Identification of the flag in the photograph": "The expert noted that the yellow-green colored flag seen in the picture was the flag of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU). The BKU is a farmers' rights organization that had uploaded the photograph on February 10. This further supported the conclusion that the photograph was not related to the ongoing farmers' protest but was from a previous protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act.", "Social media sources and statements": "The expert mentioned that the claim was viral on Twitter and Facebook. They also highlighted the tweets from Santosh Ranjan Rai, Gaurav Tiwari, and Shefali Vaidya, who alluded to the claim in their posts. However, the expert's analysis of the photograph and information from local sources contradicted the claims made by these individuals, further questioning the authenticity of the claim."}
