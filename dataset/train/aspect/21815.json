{"Testimony from Charley Wilkison": "The claim was made by Charley Wilkison, the executive director of the Combined Law Enforcement Associations of Texas (CLEAT). He stated that Texas has lost the most law enforcement officers in the line of duty of any state in America during an interview with the Texas Standard radio program. This testimony serves as the primary source of the claim.", "Evidence from the Texas Commission on Law Enforcement": "TCOLE): Charley Wilkison mentioned that his statement was based on figures from the TCOLE. The TCOLE provided information stating that there are 1,955 law enforcement officers on the Texas Peace Officer Memorial, which is the official list of officers approved by the commission. This evidence supports the claim made by Wilkison.", "Ad from the Combined Law Enforcement Associations of Texas": "CLEAT): Charley Wilkison provided a photo of an advertisement posted by CLEAT in the May 2016 edition of American Police Beat. The ad stated that 1,959 Texas officers had been killed in the line of duty. While this evidence is not an official source, it further reinforces the claim made by Wilkison.", "Data from the Officer Down Memorial Page": "ODMP): The ODMP is a nonprofit organization dedicated to honoring fallen law enforcement officers. While the specific data from ODMP is not provided, it is mentioned that the ODMP was cited by Wilkison and others as a data source. This suggests that there is additional data supporting the claim that Texas leads in officer deaths, although the exact numbers are not provided."}
