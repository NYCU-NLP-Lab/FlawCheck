{"The source of the claim": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim was published on the website \"Associated Media Coverage\" on March 7, 2016. This indicates that the source of the claim can be traced back to this specific website.", "Lack of disclaimer": "The expert's verdict highlights that the website \"Associated Media Coverage\" did not feature a disclaimer warning readers that its content was not to be taken seriously. This suggests that the absence of a disclaimer raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Limited web presence": "The expert's verdict mentions that the website \"Associated Media Coverage\" appeared to have only four articles and was created on February 18, 2016. This limited web presence raises questions about the credibility and reach of the source, as a significant news event like a multi-state curfew would likely be covered by multiple sources.", "Absence of official representatives": "The expert's verdict points out that no individuals named \"Donald McCarthy\" were listed among DOT representatives. This suggests that the lack of official representatives mentioned in the claim raises concerns about its authenticity."}
