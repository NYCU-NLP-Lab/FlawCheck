{"Comparison of registered voters and votes cast": "The expert verified the claim by comparing the number of registered voters in Detroit in 2020 (504,714) with the number of votes cast in the general election (250,138). This data showed that the claim of more votes than eligible voters was false.", "Census Bureau population estimates": "The expert also cross-referenced the voting statistics with the U.S. Census Bureau's population estimates for Detroit. They found that the voting numbers were consistent with the estimated population, further debunking the claim of voter fraud.", "Explanation of": "out-of-balance\" precincts: The expert explained that the claim may have stemmed from a misunderstanding of \"out-of-balance\" precincts, where the number of votes counted slightly differs from the number of voters checked in. They clarified that these discrepancies are usually due to routine errors and not evidence of fraud.", "Low number of mismatched votes": "The expert mentioned that Detroit reported only 357 mismatched votes across all out-of-balance precincts, which accounted for less than 0.2% of the total ballots cast citywide. This low number further discredited the claim of widespread voter fraud."}
