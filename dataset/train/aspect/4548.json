{"Visual evidence": "The video published by National Dastak shows men inspecting a school bus and other vehicles carrying EVMs in Chandauli, Uttar Pradesh. This visual evidence supports the claim made by SP-BSP workers.", "Caption in the video": "The video contains a caption in Hindi that explicitly states the occurrence of EVM fraud in Chandauli, Uttar Pradesh. This caption further strengthens the claim being made.", "Previous debunking by Alt News": "Alt News had previously debunked the same video when it was circulated with a false narrative during the Madhya Pradesh assembly elections. This previous debunking provides evidence that the video is not authentic and has been falsely attributed to different incidents.", "Clarification by Chief Electoral Officer": "Madhya Pradesh: The Chief Electoral Officer of Madhya Pradesh clarified that the EVMs shown in the video were actually reserve machines stationed at police stations. These machines were meant to be used as replacements for malfunctioning machines during polling and were not part of the polled EVMs stored in the strong room. This clarification contradicts the claim made by SP-BSP workers and further questions the authenticity of the video."}
