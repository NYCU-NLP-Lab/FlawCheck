Census Bureau's population data: The expert used the population data provided by the U.S. Census Bureau, which estimated the population of the United States to be around 308.7 million people in 2010.", "Lack of concrete data on civilian guns": "The expert highlighted the scarcity of federally sponsored gun research and the absence of a comprehensive database that captures the total number, locations, and types of firearms and firearm owners in the United States.", "Estimates from available studies": "The expert mentioned various estimates from different sources. For example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released a report in 2007 estimating the number of guns to be around 294 million. The National Rifle Association (NRA) described the number as \"approaching 300 million.\" Additionally, a Congressional Research Service (CRS) study suggested a slightly higher estimate of 310 million guns as of 2009.", "Lack of evidence supporting gun proliferation exceeding population growth": "The expert mentioned a theory suggesting that gun proliferation in the country has been increasing at a rate higher than population growth. However, the expert stated that there was no evidence to support this theory, indicating the difficulty in determining the exact number of guns compared to the population."}
