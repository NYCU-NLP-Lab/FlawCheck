{"The claim is based on videos circulating on the internet that show Breyers ice cream not melting": "2. The videos actually show a \"frozen dairy dessert\" and not ice cream, as mentioned in a pop-up comment in the video. Breyers addressed this distinction on their website, explaining that the \"Frozen Dairy Desserts\" label is used for products that do not meet the FDA's definition of ice cream.", "The FDA has specific requirements for a product to be labeled as ice cream": "and anything that does not meet these requirements is not considered ice cream.", "Other dessert manufacturers also use FDA": "approved ingredients to control the melt rate and prevent freezer burn, so the phenomenon of a frozen product not melting is not exclusive to Breyers and does not indicate a violation of FDA regulations."}
