The agenda included an item that stated the city would \"strongly oppose any legislation that would preempt the City\u2019s authority and support legislation that proposes to lift preemptions.\" This item indicates that the city of Portland was indeed considering the implementation of a real estate transfer tax.", "The third aspect employed to verify the claim is the understanding of preemption and its implications": "The article explains that cities and counties generally dislike preemption because it limits their ability to raise revenue through taxes and fees.
