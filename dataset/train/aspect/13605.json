{"The claim asserts that": "every single person who has cancer has a pH that is too acidic.\" The expert's verdict confirms that cancer cells do thrive in an acidic environment, but clarifies that this does not mean all cancer patients have overly acidic pH levels.", "The claim attributes the Nobel Prize to Dr": "Otto Warburg for proving that cancer cannot survive in an alkaline-rich environment. However, the expert's verdict states that Warburg won the Nobel Prize in 1931 for his discovery of the \"nature and mode of action of the respiratory enzyme,\" which opened up new ways in the fields of cellular metabolism and cellular respiration.", "The expert": "s verdict also mentions the \"Warburg Effect,\" which is the observation that cancer cells consume glucose and produce lactate.
