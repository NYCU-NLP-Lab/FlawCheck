{"The expert mentions that the claim of": "more than 43 percent of all food stamps are given to illegals\" is mathematically impossible given the number of illegal immigrants in the United States. The expert refers to data from the Pew Hispanic Center, which estimated that there were 11.2 million illegal immigrants in the United States in 2010, making it impossible for the claim to be true.", "The expert highlights that it is against the law for illegal immigrants to receive food stamps and that the government has a process to verify immigration status": "They mention that citizen children of illegal immigrants can qualify for food stamps, but this is not enough to account for the claimed 43 percent.", "The expert points out that the number of food stamp recipients in October 2008 was 30": "8 million, and even if 43 percent of them were given to illegals, it would exceed the total number of illegal immigrants at the time, which was 11.6 million. This further supports the impossibility of the claim.", "The expert concludes by stating that the claim is": "ridiculously false\" and assigns it a \"Pants on Fire!\" rating. They emphasize that the claim ignores basic realities and facts, such as the mathematical impossibility and the legal restrictions on food stamp eligibility for illegal immigrants."}
