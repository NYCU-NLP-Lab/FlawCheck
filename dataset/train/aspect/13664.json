{"The claim was based on a report from the website Red State Watcher": "which stated that Hillary Clinton canceled a campaign event in Florida after being bombarded with \"lock her up\" chants by Donald Trump supporters.", "Red State Watcher provided two pieces of evidence to support their claim": "a photograph from the New York Times showing Clinton walking through a crowd holding \"Trump/Pence\" signs, and a Facebook post from an anonymous person claiming that Clinton was too afraid to exit her vehicle.", "However": "it was pointed out that the two pieces of evidence contradicted each other, as the photograph showed Clinton interacting with the crowd outside her vehicle.", "The New York Times confirmed the authenticity of the photograph": "which was taken during Clinton's impromptu visit to greet early voters in Pompano Beach, Florida. The visit occurred outside the Emma Lou Olson Civic Center, not the Pompano Beach Amphitheater where a rally was not scheduled. Some Trump supporters chanted \"lock her up,\" but it did not deter Clinton from taking selfies with her supporters."}
