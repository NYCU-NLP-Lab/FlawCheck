{"The claim states that 9": "000 migrants illegally passed through the United States border in 2020 under President Donald Trump, while over 100,000 have entered unlawfully under President Joe Biden in 2021. However, the claim is deemed inaccurate by Michelle Mittelstadt, communications director at the Migration Policy Institute, who states that the 9,000 claim for 2020 is inaccurate. She explains that while there was a reduction in mobility worldwide due to Covid-19, the Border Patrol encountered far more than 9,000 individuals.", "The expert": "Jeff Passel from the Pew Research Center, highlights that there is no specific data on the number of unauthorized immigrants who crossed the border. The data provided by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is based on \"encounters\" rather than exact crossings.", "The US Customs and Border Protection": "CBP), a law enforcement agency under DHS, records data for fiscal years and not calendar years. They reported about 43,000 Border Patrol apprehensions between March and September of 2020, which includes 42,547 on the southwest border and 404 on the northern border. This data contradicts the claim of 9,000 illegal crossings in 2020.", "The Facebook posts also mention that Biden said he inherited": "a mess\" at the border. However, the quote attributed to Biden seems to be closer to Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer's statement about Biden inheriting a \"huge mess\" on immigration. Biden himself referred to the mess inherited from the Trump administration's Covid-19 response."}
