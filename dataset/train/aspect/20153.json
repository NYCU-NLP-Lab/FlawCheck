Only individuals at Merrill Lynch gave a majority of donations to Republicans.", "It is important to note that the expert pointed out a caveat in how Gohmert portrayed the data": "The expert clarified that the data used by the expert was from the 2008 campaign cycle, and Gohmert presented it in the present tense."}
