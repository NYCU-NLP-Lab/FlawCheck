{"The claim is based on projected figures": "The expert points out that the displayed figures for the leading causes of death in the United States in 2016 are projections based on past trends. This is because up-to-date information of this nature is not available.", "Abortion is not recorded as a cause of death": "The expert highlights that the organization responsible for recording causes of death, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), does not include abortion as a cause of death in their data. The list in question includes abortion as the number one cause of death, which contradicts the CDC's official data for 2014.", "The list does not accurately represent firearm": "related deaths: The expert mentions that the list includes murder by firearm as the lowest-ranked cause of death in the United States. However, the FBI recorded 8,124 murders by firearms in the same year, which would place it higher on the list. This discrepancy raises doubts about the accuracy of the information presented.", "The list focuses on medical conditions rather than intentional killings": "The expert points out that the majority of causes of death on the list are related to medical maladies, while intentional killings are only represented by murder by firearm. This aspect questions the relevance of using this information to make a point about gun issues, as intentional killings are not the main focus of the list."}
