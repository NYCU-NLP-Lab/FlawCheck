{"Multiple reports from reputable news sources": "The expert found that several news outlets, including New York Post, Daily Mail, The Sun, Mirror, Metro, and Atlanta Black Star, had reported on the incident. These reports provided details about the incident, such as the location (34th Street in Manhattan, New York) and the lack of response from the MTA and NYPD. This indicates that the incident did occur and was not fabricated.", "Viral video with millions of views": "The expert discovered that the video of the incident had been tweeted by @MrJonCee and had garnered over 17 million views. It was also posted on Reddit by user ventriiloquist. The fact that the video went viral and was shared on multiple platforms suggests that it was a real incident captured on camera.", "Analysis of the video": "Since the viral video was of low resolution, Alt News, the fact-checking organization, analyzed a higher-quality version uploaded by @MrJonCee. They observed that a caucasian man spat on an African American. This analysis provides visual evidence supporting the claim.", "Lack of details about the individuals involved": "While the reports did not provide specific details about the persons involved in the incident, they did mention that it was seemingly a racist act. This indicates that the incident had racial undertones, which aligns with the claim that a Muslim man spat on a passenger. However, it is important to note that the reports did not confirm the religious identity of the person involved."}
