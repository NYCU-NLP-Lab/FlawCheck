{"Reverse image search": "The expert used a reverse image search on Google to verify the authenticity of the claim. They found that the image had been circulating on the internet for at least two years, indicating that it was not a recent photograph of a JNU student.", "Comparison with previous instances": "The expert found previous instances of the same image being shared on social media without any mention of it being a JNU student. This indicated that the image was most likely lifted from the internet and circulated with a misleading context.", "Lack of context and information": "The expert noted that the image was posted on a blog in 2016 with no context or information about the photo. This further supported the conclusion that it was not a recent photograph of a JNU student.", "Unrelated and old images": "The expert also found another photograph being circulated, claiming it to be a JNU student. However, they determined that it was an unrelated and old image. This suggests that the claim was based on false information and not authentic evidence."}
