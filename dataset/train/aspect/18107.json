{"Warner": "s reasoning for voting against the amendment: The expert highlights Warner's statement that he supported Keystone but believed it should be used as leverage to gain support for a comprehensive energy bill. This indicates that Warner's actions were motivated by a different agenda, rather than genuine support for the pipeline.", "Reid": "s promise and Warner's vote: The expert mentions that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid promised a vote on legislation mandating the approval of Keystone if the Shaheen-Portman bill was approved without amendments. Warner joined most Democrats in voting to end debate and allow the bill to proceed, indicating that he prioritized the energy efficiency bill over Keystone.", "Republicans": "efforts cut off by Reid: The expert notes that Republicans offered amendments to the bill, including one for Keystone, but their efforts were cut off by Reid. Warner's vote to end debate and proceed with the unadulterated bill suggests that he did not support the inclusion of Keystone in the legislation."}
