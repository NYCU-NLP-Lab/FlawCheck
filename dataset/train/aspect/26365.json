{"The quatrain allegedly written by Michel de Nostradamus is a four": "line poem that describes predictions of a future \"plague\" that would \"fall upon the world.\" However, there is no mention of a \"jezebel\" or a \"feeble man\" in Nostradamus' original works.", "The meme in question": "which circulated in early 2021, does not provide any information about its origin or the original poster. It is unclear where the quatrain originated from and who attributed it to Nostradamus.", "Nostradamus": "predictions, although often vague and open to interpretation, have been credited with accurately predicting historical events. However, the quatrain mentioned in the claim does not align with any of his known works.", "The quatrains written by Nostradamus do not follow a chronological order": "and the \"centuries\" in which they are grouped do not correspond to specific time periods or predictions. Therefore, it is challenging to determine the intended timing of any particular prediction within Nostradamus' works."}
