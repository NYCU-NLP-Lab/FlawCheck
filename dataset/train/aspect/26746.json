{"Comparison to other states": "The expert's verdict mentions that Rhode Island's unemployment insurance system was compared to other states to verify the claim. Specifically, it was compared to how other states run their programs and the costs associated with those programs.", "Reference to a specific report": "The expert's verdict refers to a report called the \"2014 State Business Tax Climate Index\" published by The Tax Foundation. This report was used to assess Rhode Island's ranking in terms of its unemployment insurance system and its expenses.", "Ranking in a specific category": "According to the mentioned report, Rhode Island ranks the worst in the category that compares unemployment insurance systems. While this doesn't directly address the claim of being the most expensive, it provides some evidence to support the claim.", "Evaluation of multiple metrics": "The expert's verdict highlights that the overall cost of a program cannot be determined by evaluating just a single metric. Therefore, even though Rhode Island may not be ranked worst in any individual category, the cumulative evaluation of multiple factors could indicate higher expenses in the state's unemployment insurance system."}
