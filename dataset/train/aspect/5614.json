{"White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer": "s statement: The expert's verdict mentions that White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer made the claim about global food demand increasing by 50 to 97 percent by 2050. This statement is one of the aspects used to verify the authenticity of the claim.", "Projections and research on food increases": "The expert's verdict mentions that both the data provided by the White House and other research support the claim that food demand will increase in the coming decades. The verdict also cites studies from 2014 and 2011 that provide estimates of food demand increase between 59 to 98 percent and 100 to 110 percent respectively. These projections and research contribute to verifying the claim.", "Cornell University professor": "s estimation: The expert's verdict includes the estimation of Harry Kaiser, a Cornell University professor and expert in food demand. He calculated a 39 percent increase in global food demand based on projected population increases and per-capita food demand using 2012 data from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. This estimation provides another aspect to verify the claim.", "World Resources Institute": "s assessment: The expert's verdict mentions Richard Waite, an associate from the World Resources Institute's Food Program, who stated that Spicer's estimate was too high. Waite explained that using projected figures from 2006, as Spicer did, can be misleading. The World Resources Institute estimated about a 70 percent increase in global food demand between 2006 and the present. This assessment from the World Resources Institute adds another aspect to the verification process."}
