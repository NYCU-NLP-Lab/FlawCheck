{"The claim was based on a report from a New York Post columnist": "John Crudele, who alleged that Census Bureau workers were instructed by their supervisors to manipulate data to lower the unemployment rate before the 2012 election.", "The report identified one Census Bureau worker": "Julius Buckmon, who supposedly admitted to fabricating data. Buckmon claimed that he was told to make up information instead of conducting surveys.", "The expert": "s verdict highlighted that Buckmon had already left the Census Bureau in August 2011, well before the alleged incident took place in 2012. This undermines the claim's credibility by pointing out that the implicated individual was not even present during the relevant time period.", "The expert also mentioned that the original report did not provide concrete evidence of widespread fraud or manipulation": "relying mainly on an unnamed source and the testimony of one individual. This raises doubts about the reliability and validity of the claim."}
