{"The claim states that state Senate President Stephen Sweeney": "gave us the nation's highest income tax rates, driving out jobs.\" The first aspect employed to verify the authenticity of this claim is to analyze the historical record of income tax rates in New Jersey during Sweeney's tenure as a state Senator.", "The expert": "s verdict also includes a statement from Steve Lonegan, director of the New Jersey chapter of Americans for Prosperity, arguing that all taxes, including sales and property taxes, contribute to the overall tax burden on individuals' income. This implies that focusing solely on income tax rates may not provide a comprehensive picture of the impact on job growth and the economy.", "Another aspect employed to verify the claim is the fact that the": "millionaires' tax,\" which was mentioned in the ad as a driving force behind high income tax rates, expired in 2010. Sweeney became the state Senate president the same year, and since then, he has attempted to reinstate the tax twice, but both measures were vetoed by Gov. Chris Christie."}
