{"The documentary": "Mermaids: The Body Found,\" aired on Discovery's Animal Planet channel, which is known for producing factual content. However, the expert's verdict states that the documentary is actually a pseudo-documentary, indicating that it is not based on real events or scientific evidence.", "The program includes obvious CGI": "produced video sequences, such as the footage of mermen being hauled up in fishing nets. This suggests that the visuals presented in the documentary are not authentic and were created for dramatic effect.", "The documentary features actors playing fictional characters": "including \"Dr. Paul Robertson, former NOAA scientist.\" This further supports the claim that the program is fictional and not based on real scientific research or discoveries.", "The documentary incorporates the concept of the": "aquatic ape\" hypothesis, a generally discounted idea in the field of evolutionary biology. This hypothesis suggests that early hominid species went through an aquatic phase in their evolution. The expert's verdict criticizes the documentary for presenting CGI mermaids that make no evolutionary sense, combining human and dolphin characteristics in a short period of time. This highlights the lack of scientific credibility in the program's portrayal of mermaids."}
