{"Testimony from U": "S. Rep. Thomas Massie: The expert's verdict includes an account from Massie, another member of Congress, who supports Broun's claim. Massie recalls a specific vote where Gingrey and Kingston initially voted in favor of a legislation, but Broun voted against it. This testimony adds credibility to Broun's assertion that his colleagues have changed their votes to match his.", "Similar voting patterns": "The expert's verdict states that Broun, Gingrey, and Kingston have voted the same way all but a few times since 2013. This similarity in voting patterns suggests a potential alignment and supports Broun's claim.", "Broun": "s lower party line voting percentage: The expert's verdict mentions that Broun has voted along party lines 87 percent of the time, while Gingrey and Kingston have both voted along party lines at a 95 percent clip. This difference in voting behavior further strengthens Broun's assertion that he is often at odds with his fellow Republicans."}
