{"The passage of SB": "145 extends the exception for individuals convicted of non-forcible vaginal intercourse with a minor to also include those convicted of non-forcible oral or anal sex with a minor.", "California state senator Scott Wiener introduced SB": "145 to modify the state penal code and allow certain individuals convicted of sex offenses involving minors to apply for discretionary relief from registering as sex offenders.", "The aim of the revised statute is to address the disparity between how heterosexual and LGBT sex offenders are treated under existing law": "specifically regarding consensual yet illegal sexual relations between a teenager and a partner within 10 years of age.", "The current law disproportionately targets LGBT young people for mandatory sex offender registration": "as it requires registration for oral and anal intercourse but allows judicial discretion for vaginal intercourse. This distinction is seen as irrational and unfair."}
