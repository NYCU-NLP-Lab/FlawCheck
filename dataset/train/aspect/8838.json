{"The claimant": "s personal experience: The expert would have examined the specific details provided by Reid Ribble, such as his statement that he lost his health insurance and doctor because of Obamacare. This would have been a starting point to verify the authenticity of the claim.", "Insurance company changes": "The expert would have investigated the announced change in Ribble's health insurance carrier, Principal Financial Group, which decided to exit the health insurance business. This change could have potentially impacted Ribble's coverage and access to his preferred doctor.", "Coverage agreements": "The expert would have examined the coverage agreements between Principal Financial Group and Affinity Medical Group, Ribble's doctor's affiliation. If UnitedHealth, the new insurance provider, did not have an agreement with Affinity, it could have affected Ribble's ability to continue seeing his doctor.", "Timing of the coverage change": "The expert would have considered the timeline of Ribble's coverage ending with Principal Financial Group on December 31, 2010, and the implementation of health care reform. If Ribble's coverage change was a result of the new legislation, it would support the claim that Obamacare was the cause of his insurance and doctor loss."}
