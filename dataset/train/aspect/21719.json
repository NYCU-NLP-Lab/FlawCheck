{"The expert analyzed the arguments against right": "to-work legislation, which focus on economic matters such as the impact on business friendliness, union strength, and wages and incomes.", "The expert referenced a statement made by State Sen": "Julie Lassa, who claimed that families in right-to-work states are less likely to have health insurance and that the infant mortality rate is 15 percent higher in these states.", "The expert used data from the U": "S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to compare the infant mortality rates in states with and without right-to-work laws. The calculation showed a difference of 15 percent.", "The expert also consulted with Geoffrey Swain": "a medical expert on infant mortality, who provided more recent data from 2012. This data showed that right-to-work states had a higher infant mortality rate compared to the remaining states, further supporting the claim."}
