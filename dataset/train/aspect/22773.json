{"Lack of evidence": "The expert's verdict states that there is no evidence to support the claim that Clint Eastwood made the quoted statement. No major publication has attributed these words to him, and there is no video evidence of him making such comments.", "Similarity to another source": "The quote in question is strikingly similar to a passage written by a Texas school board member in 2007. The expert highlights this similarity, suggesting that the claim may have been derived from this source instead.", "Contradiction with Eastwood": "s views: The expert mentions that the quote contradicts Clint Eastwood's known views on religion. In a 1973 interview, Eastwood stated that he did not believe in God. More recently, he expressed respect for religious individuals but also mentioned that living without religion is acceptable. This contradiction adds doubt to the authenticity of the claim.", "Unverified attribution": "The expert concludes that Clint Eastwood did not say the quoted statement. They suggest that his name was simply attached to the words he didn't utter in order to lend credibility to the notion. This unverified attribution further questions the authenticity of the claim."}
