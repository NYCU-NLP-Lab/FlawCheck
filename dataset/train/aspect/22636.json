{"The White House claimed that the economy grew 3": "1 percent last year, while the U.S. Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis put growth at 2.9 percent. This difference in reported growth rates raises questions about the accuracy of the claim.", "The White House focused on a little": "used measure, BEA's Table 1.1.11, which measures the change between the last quarter of the year compared to the same quarter a year earlier. This measure was not normally used by economists to gauge annual growth, suggesting a selective use of data to make the economy appear more robust.", "The claim of achieving 3 percent growth for the first time in 13 years is misleading": "While it is true that the last time fourth-quarter GDP was 3 percent or more above the same quarter a year earlier was in 2005, there have been other 12-month periods in the past 13 years when GDP grew faster or equaled the 3 percent rate.", "The claim is also inconsistent with previous promises made by President Trump": "as he had repeatedly promised 4 to 6 percent growth, making the 2.9 percent growth in 2018 fall short of expectations. This raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim and suggests a discrepancy between promises and actual performance."}
