{"Lack of visible party affiliation or definitive engagement in fraud": "The video did not show anyone visibly affiliated with any party or definitively engaging in fraud of any type. This raised doubts about the claim that Democrats were committing fraud during the 2016 primary.", "Unidentified papers being moved to plastic bins": "The activities shown in the video only involved people moving unidentified papers to plastic bins. The nature of these papers was not apparent just by watching the video, making it difficult to verify the claim.", "Discrepancies in camera timestamps": "The timestamps displayed in the video clearly showed an 18 September 2016 date, while the Democratic primaries had concluded on 7 June 2016. This inconsistency raised questions about the authenticity of the video and its connection to the claimed fraud.", "Mislabeling of video locations and reuse of clips": "The video was labeled as being from Pennsylvania, where the primaries took place in April 2016. However, the same exact clips were published on YouTube in September 2016 as evidence of election fraud in Russia. This mislabeling and reuse of clips strongly suggested that the videos were misrepresented and not related to the claimed fraud in the Democratic primaries."}
