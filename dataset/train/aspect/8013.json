{"The claim is based on a television ad by the Club For Growth that features a female announcer stating that Donald Trump promised": "to take care of everybody (through government-run healthcare and) the government's going to pay for it.\" The expert's verdict highlights that this ad is trying to make it appear that Trump is in favor of more government-run healthcare.", "The ad cuts to a clip of Hillary Clinton promising": "we will have quality affordable healthcare for every American\" and then to CBS News anchor Scott Pelley questioning Trump about universal healthcare. Trump responds by saying, \"I'm going to take care of everybody,\" and when asked who will pay for it, he says, \"The government's going to pay for it.\" This exchange is used as evidence to support the claim.", "The expert points out that the Club For Growth ad is misleading because it implies that Trump wants more government healthcare": "while in reality, Trump has repeatedly called for the repeal of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). The expert explains that Obamacare is not government-run healthcare but a system of private insurance plans with government regulations and subsidies.", "The expert highlights a quote from Trump where he says": "Obamacare's going to be repealed and replaced,\" and describes it as a disaster due to rising premiums. Trump also states that \"everybody's got to be covered\" and that he doesn't care if it costs him votes. This statement is used to support the claim that Trump promised to take care of everybody through government involvement in healthcare."}
