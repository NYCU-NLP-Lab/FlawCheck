{"The governor": "s statement: The expert's verdict mentions that Governor Nathan Deal made the claim about Georgia saving $20 million through changes in criminal sentencing. This statement serves as the basis for verifying the authenticity of the claim.", "Reduction in state payments to counties": "Deal's spokesman, Brian Robinson, provided information that in 2011, the state paid counties over $23 million to house state inmates in county jails. However, in 2013, the payments were significantly reduced to slightly under $3.2 million, resulting in approximately $20 million in savings. This aspect verifies the claim by showing a direct correlation between the changes in criminal sentencing and the reduction in state payments.", "Legislative changes in criminal sentencing": "The expert's verdict mentions that in 2012, Georgia lawmakers crafted legislation to establish alternatives to incarceration for low-level, nonviolent drug and property offenders. This change aimed to create cost-effective criminal justice approaches without compromising public safety. By implementing these changes, the state projected savings of $264 million in prison spending over the next five years. This aspect verifies the claim by providing evidence of the specific actions taken to achieve the savings.", "Shift towards community supervision and treatment": "Another aspect mentioned in the expert's verdict is the state's diversion of addicts to community supervision and treatment through accountability courts instead of sending them to prison. This approach is part of the changes in criminal sentencing and aims to reduce incarceration rates for nonviolent offenders. By diverting individuals to treatment programs rather than prison, the state can save on the costs associated with housing inmates. This aspect further verifies the claim by demonstrating an alternative approach to criminal justice that contributes to the reported savings."}
