{"Lack of earlier publication": "The expert found that there were no versions of the quote published until mid-2013, long after Carl Sagan's death. This suggests that the quote did not exist in the attributed form before that time.", "Attribution on social literature site": "The quote was frequently attributed to Carl Sagan on the social literature site GoodReads. However, the expert could not find the quote in any of Sagan's books, casting doubt on its authenticity.", "Placement on Wikiquote page": "The quote appeared on Carl Sagan's Wikiquote page, but it was listed under the \"misattributed\" section. This indicates that the quote was not originally associated with Sagan and was likely a misattribution.", "Confirmation from P": "C. Hodgell: P.C. Hodgell, the author of the novel Seeker's Mask, confirmed that the quote \"That which can be destroyed by the truth, should be\" appeared in her 1994 novel. She stated that she first heard of the Sagan quote in 2013, suggesting that the quote gained popularity and was mistakenly attributed to Sagan."}
