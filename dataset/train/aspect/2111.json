{"The photograph in question is a digital artwork created by Corey Cowan and is not an authentic depiction of a tornado sucking up a rainbow": "2. The image is a composite of three separate images, including two rainbows and a tornado. The original tornado image was stretched and masked to create the final composition.", "Tornadoes do not affect light in the manner depicted in the viral photograph": "A real photograph taken by storm chaser Eric Nguyen shows the actual appearance of a rainbow during a tornado, which does not involve the tornado sucking up the colors of the rainbow.", "The presence of a rainbow in the photograph was merely a coincidence": "as the tornado happened to end right over the rainbow. This was captured by Eric Nguyen, who photographed a tornado descending from a dark storm cloud while sunlight reflected off raindrops to form a rainbow."}
