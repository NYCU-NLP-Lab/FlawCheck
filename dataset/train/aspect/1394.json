{"Lack of verification": "The Twitter account 'realjanhvi' does not have a blue tick-mark, indicating that its identity has not been verified by Twitter. This raises doubts about the authenticity of the account.", "Inactive account behavior": "Despite being created in June 2017, the 'realjanhvi' account has only 19 tweets. This is unusual for actors who are typically active on social media, promoting their work and engaging with their audience. The lack of activity suggests that the account may not be genuine.", "Connection to another account": "Upon investigating the numeric Twitter ID of 'realjanhvi', it was found to be associated with an account called 'govinddeshpremi'. This connection raises suspicions about the legitimacy of the 'realjanhvi' account and suggests that it may have been renamed.", "Previous account name and Facebook page": "Screenshots and evidence from other Twitter users revealed that the previous name associated with the 'govinddeshpremi' account was 'Chowkidar Govind Saroj'. Additionally, a Facebook page linked to Govind Saroj showed a similar pattern of merging different pages. These findings further cast doubt on the authenticity of the 'realjanhvi' account and its endorsement of PM Modi."}
