{"Lack of evidence linking the": "pendejo\" poster to Puerto Rico: The expert points out that the photograph of the poster does not contain any information identifying it as being taken in Puerto Rico. This raises doubts about the claim that the poster is \"all over\" the territory.", "Limited resources and energy in Puerto Rico": "The expert questions whether Puerto Ricans, who were facing a scarcity of basic necessities like food, water, electricity, and phone service, would have the resources and energy to launch an island-wide poster campaign.", "Possible preexistence of the": "pendejo\" poster: The expert suggests that if the image was taken on the island and there are indeed \"pendejo\" posters all over, it would not be surprising if they predate both the hurricane and Trump's visit. The fact that the poster has been sold by Snake Hawk Press since September 2016 further supports this possibility.", "Lack of confirmation from poster creators": "The expert mentions that Crazy Saguaro Tees, a t-shirt retailer, denies creating the image, and Snake Hawk Press, the studio selling the posters, did not respond to inquiries. This lack of confirmation raises doubts about the authenticity and widespread distribution of the poster."}
