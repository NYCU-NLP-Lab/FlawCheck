{"The claim is based on a study conducted by United Van Lines": "a national moving company, which categorized Wisconsin as a \"high outbound\" state in their 2012 study, indicating a high percentage of moves were for people leaving Wisconsin.", "However": "the 2013 study released before the claim was made showed that Wisconsin was not labeled as a \"high outbound\" state, but rather as a \"balanced\" state, meaning the difference between the number of people moving into and out of Wisconsin was negligible.", "The U": "S. Census Bureau also tracks state-to-state migration, and their latest one-year figures (from July 1, 2012 to July 1, 2013) ranked Wisconsin as the 12th state with a net loss of residents to other states.", "Additionally": "the Census Bureau conducts a survey asking residents if they lived in the same residence one year ago, and according to the latest survey data, Wisconsin actually posted positive net migration, contradicting the claim of being among the top 10 states for out-migration."}
