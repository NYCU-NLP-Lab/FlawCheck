{"The claim misrepresents the Iran nuclear deal from 2015": "which involved multiple nations, not just the United States under Obama, and did not involve the United States giving cash to Iran.", "The funds mentioned in the claim were not a direct cash gift from the United States to Iran": "but rather the unfreezing of Iran's own assets that were previously frozen as part of the sanctions.", "The exact amount of funds that Iran gained access to is debatable": "with estimates ranging from $56 billion to $150 billion. It is unclear whether Iran ultimately received the full $150 billion or a lesser amount.", "While it is true that the Iran nuclear deal resulted in Iran gaining access to billions of dollars of its own funds": "it is uncertain how these funds might be spent and whether they could potentially be used for purposes such as supporting terrorism."}
