This information contradicted the claim of his death in 2020.", "The inclusion of late sports icon Hank Aaron and actress Cloris Leachman in the article": "who had both recently passed away, was identified as evidence that the article was regularly updated and not specifically about deceased celebrities from 2020.", "The history of using living actors": "such as Nick Stahl, in similar misleading advertisements by Definition.org was considered as an additional aspect in verifying the authenticity of the claim.
