{"The FBI investigation and court filings": "The expert mentions that Kevin Seefried came to the attention of the FBI after photographs showed him carrying a Confederate flag inside the halls of Congress during the January 6 attack. The court filings by an FBI special agent state that Seefried had said he traveled to Washington, D.C., on Jan. 6 \"to hear President Trump speak.\" This evidence strongly indicates Seefried's involvement in the attack and his support for Trump.", "The viral meme and Facebook posts": "The expert refers to a widely shared meme that claimed Seefried, the person carrying the Confederate flag, was a registered Democrat and Biden supporter. The meme included a photograph of Seefried and text questioning whether Speaker Nancy Pelosi would impeach Biden too. The expert highlights the popularity of this meme and provides a screenshot showing multiple Facebook posts containing it.", "VoterRecords": "com listing: Some Facebook users cited a listing for a \"Kevin D Seefried\" on the website VoterRecords.com as evidence of Seefried's Democratic registration. However, the expert points out that the listing came from an unofficial source and referred to a voter born in 1986, who is much younger than Seefried. The age discrepancy raises doubts about the accuracy of the voter registration information.", "Unproven but strong indication": "The expert concludes by stating that they cannot definitively confirm Seefried's voter registration status as a Democrat. However, based on the available evidence, it strongly indicates that Seefried acted in support of Trump and participated in an effort to overturn Biden's legitimate victory. This contradicts the meme's claim that Seefried is a \"Biden supporter\" and highlights the baseless nature of the description."}
