{"Comparison of tax payments and expenses": "The expert analyzed the claim by comparing the amount of money Americans spend on taxes versus the combined expenses of food, housing, and clothing. They used data from the federal Bureau of Economic Analysis for 2014 to determine the total receipts for taxes and the expenditures on food, housing, and clothing.", "Reference to a blog post by the Tax Foundation": "The Rubio campaign provided the expert with a blog post from the Tax Foundation, a pro-business think tank, which supported the claim. The expert examined the information presented in the blog post, including a bar graph showing the projected amounts Americans would spend on taxes and expenses.", "Use of different methods to compare taxes and spending": "The expert acknowledged that there are different methods to compare taxes and spending. They mentioned that the Tax Foundation's method is an aggregate of what all Americans pay combined, while the expert used a method based on individual and family spending. This highlights the variability in how taxes and expenses can be compared and suggests that the claim may be true for some Americans but not others.", "Acknowledgment of potential variations in individual circumstances": "The expert pointed out that the amount any individual or family spends on taxes compared with food, clothing, and shelter can vary widely. They emphasized that Rubio's statement is likely true for some Americans but not necessarily for everyone, underscoring the complexity of the issue."}
