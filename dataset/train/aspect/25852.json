{"Hermann G\u00f6ring": "a member of Adolf Hitler's cabinet and later Prussian interior minister, worked to incorporate Nazi paramilitary forces into police departments, rather than defunding or eliminating them.", "The claim that G\u00f6ring worked to": "defund and eliminate the police departments so that they would not interfere with his Brown Shirts\" is inaccurate and unsupported by historical evidence.", "The photo used in the Instagram post to support the claim actually shows Nazis blocking Jews from entering the University of Vienna in 1938": "not related to defunding the police or interfering with elections.", "The terminology of": "defunding the police\" has no analogy in Nazi Germany, and there was never a movement to defund or eliminate police departments in that context."}
