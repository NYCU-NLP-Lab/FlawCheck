{"Lack of evidence": "The expert notes that no evidence currently supports the claims of ties between George Soros and the migrant caravan. The social media accounts spreading the claim did not provide any proof, such as news reports, FBI bulletins, or even fake news articles.", "Absence of official statements": "The FBI has not released any statements or press releases confirming Soros' alleged involvement in funding the migrant caravan. The expert couldn't find any credible news reports suggesting the FBI had made such an announcement.", "Origin of the claim": "The earliest and most popular example of the claim was posted by a Facebook user named \"Jim Snyder,\" who labeled it as \"fake news\" in the comment section. However, many social media users missed the disclaimer and shared the message as if it were reporting a genuine revelation.", "Intent behind spreading the claim": "The expert highlights that the person who initially posted the claim, Jim Snyder, stated that he did it to \"keep the Snowflakes on their toes.\" This suggests that the message was intentionally spread to provoke a reaction and feed into the conspiracy theory surrounding George Soros."}
