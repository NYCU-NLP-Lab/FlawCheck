{"The claim is based on data from the Federal Reserve": "which conducted a survey asking Americans how they would cover an emergency expense of $400. This survey provides the primary evidence for the claim.", "The survey found that 47 percent of respondents said they could not cover the": "400 expense without selling something or borrowing money. This specific percentage supports the claim that nearly half of Americans are unable to handle such an unexpected expense.", "The survey also provided a breakdown of how respondents would cope with the expense": "It revealed that 14 percent said they simply could not cover it, 10 percent would sell something, and 18 percent would rely on borrowing methods such as using a credit card over time, borrowing from friends or family, or using a payday loan.", "The claim was further supported by the fact that other researchers typically test financial vulnerability with higher amounts": "in the thousands of dollars. The use of a lower amount in the survey ($400) makes the claim more significant and alarming, as it suggests that a large portion of Americans struggle with even relatively small unexpected expenses."}
