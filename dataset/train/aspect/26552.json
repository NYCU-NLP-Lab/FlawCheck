{"The claim is cited from a Bloomberg news story published on March 31": "2009, which states that the U.S. government and the Federal Reserve have \"spent, lent, or committed\" $12.8 trillion to combat the recession.", "South Carolina Gov": "Mark Sanford referenced this statistic in a commentary for Human Events and in a letter to the editor of the State Journal-Register, both conservative publications.", "The": "12.8 trillion figure includes money lent or committed by the Federal Reserve ($7.7 trillion), related to credit discounts, debt purchases, and bailouts of financial institutions. It also includes $2 trillion related to the FDIC, including liquidity guarantees and the purchase of risky bank assets. Additionally, it includes the money spent through the two stimulus packages ($168 billion under President George W. Bush and $787 billion under President Barack Obama) and the $700 billion Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP) used to buy toxic assets.", "Economists caution that the government may not necessarily": "lose\" all of this money. For example, estimates suggest that most of the TARP money will be recovered, and collateral extended to the Federal Reserve and FDIC is essentially pledging money as collateral for their operations. The outcome of investments, such as auto company bailouts, is uncertain, but it is expected that the government will recoup some portion of the funds."}
