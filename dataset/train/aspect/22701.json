{"The claim is based on a press release from the Florida Democratic Party": "which accuses Rick Scott of calling education not a \"core function\" of the state. This press release serves as the initial source of the claim.", "The claim is further supported by a quote from a February 2011 article in Jacksonville": "s Florida Times-Union, where Rick Scott stated, \"The public expects us to get back to what the core functions of the state are, not things that would be nice but we don't have the money for.\" The Democrats argue that this statement implies education is not considered a core function by Scott.", "The Florida Democratic Party spokesman": "Eric Conrad, also adds to the verification of the claim by stating that it is hard to believe Scott considers education a core function if he was cutting a significant amount of money from it.", "Despite these supporting factors": "no direct evidence or statement from Rick Scott specifically mentioning education as not a \"core function\" of government was found. Scott's comments on core functions were more general, emphasizing that only core functions should receive funding. This lack of direct evidence makes it difficult to definitively determine if Scott made the claim."}
