{"The expert": "s research suggests that Jeb Bush's claim about Raul Cantero and Kenneth Bell being the most consistent conservatives on the Florida Supreme Court has some validity. This research finding serves as another aspect to verify the claim.", "It is noted that both Raul Cantero and Kenneth Bell left the Florida Supreme Court in 2008": "which means they are no longer serving as justices. This information, although not directly related to their reputation as conservatives, is mentioned as a factor that slightly weakens the claim's authenticity.", "The replacements for Raul Cantero and Kenneth Bell on the Florida Supreme Court were Charles Canady and Ricky Polston": "who were also appointed by Jeb Bush. This information strengthens the claim as it demonstrates that Jeb Bush's conservative appointments continued even after Cantero and Bell left the court."}
