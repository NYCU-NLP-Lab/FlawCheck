{"Lack of credible source": "The expert points out that Forest's claim cannot be verified because there is no credible source that tracks the number of children victimized by undocumented immigrants in North Carolina. Forest's campaign cited news stories about crimes committed by undocumented immigrants, but none of these stories verify the claim of \"tens of thousands\" of victimized children.", "Absence of federal government database or study": "The expert highlights that there is no federal government database or study that tracks the number of people victimized by undocumented immigrants or the age of the victims. This lack of data makes it difficult to determine the accuracy of Forest's claim.", "Fallacy in statistics": "The expert mentions that Forest's claim is based on individual cases and attempts to extrapolate the numbers to \"tens of thousands\" of victimized children. However, this approach is deemed a major fallacy in statistics by Professor Charis E. Kubrin. Forest's claim is considered vague and problematic due to this statistical fallacy.", "Similar claims by Republicans": "The expert notes that Forest's claim is similar to others made by Republicans, including President Trump. These claims express concerns about crimes committed by immigrants who are in the United States illegally. However, the expert emphasizes that ICE does not track crimes committed by undocumented immigrants or the age of the victims, further adding to the difficulty of verifying Forest's claim."}
