{"The claim is made by California Sen": "Kamala Harris in her book \"The Truths We Hold\" and is also mentioned on the campaign trail as one of the biggest challenges facing the country and students.", "The claim is supported by a Federal Reserve table showing the nation": "s cumulative student loan debt for each year from 2006 through 2018, which reveals an increase from $521 billion in 2006 to $1.57 trillion in 2018.", "Financial aid expert Mark Kantrowitz confirms that the claim is mostly correct": "with the only slight error being that Harris underestimates the growth of student loan debt outstanding.", "Hans Johnson": "director of the Public Policy Institute of California's Higher Education Center, also reviewed the data and found a 200 percent increase based on the most current Federal Reserve figures."}
