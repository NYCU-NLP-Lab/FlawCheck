{"Lack of credible evidence": "The expert notes that there is no credible direct or anecdotal evidence to support the claim that Neil DeGrasse Tyson made the statement about his interest in \"astrological physics\" stemming from his experience with LSD. This lack of evidence raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Absence of coverage by news outlets": "The expert mentions that no news outlets have covered the alleged remarks made by Tyson. This absence of coverage suggests that the quote may not have originated from Tyson himself and adds to the skepticism surrounding the claim.", "Reference to a notorious urban legend": "The purported quote references a notorious urban legend from the 1960s. This connection raises suspicions that the quote is a fabrication, as it aligns with a well-known fictional narrative rather than Tyson's actual experiences.", "Contradiction with Tyson": "s biographical information: The expert highlights that Tyson's early interest in science and space is well-documented to have begun at the age of nine, after visiting the Hayden Planetarium in New York. This contradicts the claim that his interest in \"astrological physics\" originated from his teenage experiences with LSD. The contradiction in Tyson's biographical information further casts doubt on the authenticity of the claim."}
