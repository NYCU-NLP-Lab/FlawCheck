{"Comparison of dates and locations": "The expert compared the claim that the photographs were taken during the migrant caravan in October 2018 with the actual dates and locations of the incidents depicted in the photographs. They found that the photographs were several years old and depicted altercations between police officers and protesters in Mexico, not incidents involving the migrant caravan.", "Examination of original sources": "The expert examined the original sources of the claim, including the social media posts and accounts that shared the photographs. They found that the claim was being spread by multiple accounts and that the verbatim message was being parroted by smaller Twitter accounts, suggesting a coordinated effort to spread the false information.", "Analysis of political context": "The expert considered the political context surrounding the claim, specifically the use of the migrant caravan to stoke fears about immigration by conservative pundits and politicians. They highlighted the unfounded conspiracy theories and declarations made by individuals such as Representative Matt Gaetz and President Trump, which further suggested a motive to smear the group of refugees.", "Cross": "referencing with credible sources: The expert cross-referenced the information from the claim with credible sources, such as Revista Emeequis, a reputable news outlet. They found that the main photograph attached to the rumor was actually from a 2012 incident involving students and police officers near Mexico City, further discrediting the claim."}
