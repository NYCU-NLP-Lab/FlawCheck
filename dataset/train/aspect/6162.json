{"Comparison to historical data": "The expert compared the number of African American men in prison, jail, on probation, or parole to the number of African American men enslaved in 1850. This historical comparison was used to highlight the disproportionate rates of arrests among African American and Hispanic men.", "Data from Bureau of Justice Statistics": "The expert reached out to the Department of Justice's Bureau of Justice Statistics for current figures on the number of African American men serving time in state or federal correctional facilities in 2013. This data was used to support the claim of a higher number of African American men in the criminal justice system compared to the number of enslaved men in 1850.", "Data from The Sentencing Project": "The expert also contacted The Sentencing Project, a national nonprofit advocacy group, for data on the number of African American men currently imprisoned or on probation and parole. The data provided by The Sentencing Project supported a higher estimate than the Bureau of Justice Statistics, including those serving time in local jails.", "Census data on slavery in 1850": "To verify the claim about the number of African American men enslaved in 1850, the expert consulted the U.S. Census Bureau and the Rhode Island Historical Society for data. The Census of 1850 showed that there were 872,924 male African American slaves over the age of 15 in the United States at that time. This historical data was used as a benchmark to compare with the number of African American men under judicial system supervision."}
