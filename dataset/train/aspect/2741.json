This report, which Nashed provided as a fact-sheet, likely contains data and statistics supporting the claim of a 74 percent decline in apprehensions.", "Verification by Border Patrol officials": "Omar Zamora, a Border Patrol spokesman, explained that when assessing the security of the border, officials consider factors such as border apprehension and drug smuggling statistics, as well as the economic health and crime rate of border towns. While Zamora did not specifically mention the 74 percent decline in apprehensions, his input suggests that there are broader assessments conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of border security measures."}
