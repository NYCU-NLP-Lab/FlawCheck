{"Sen": "Maria Cantwell's tweet: The claim was made by Sen. Maria Cantwell, who tweeted that \"7 million more Americans are uninsured now than when President Trump was elected.\" This tweet serves as the primary source of the claim.", "Gallup": "s National Health and Well-Being Index: Cantwell's tweet included the source of her claim, which was Gallup's National Health and Well-Being Index. This index provides quarterly data on the number of Americans lacking health insurance.", "Census Bureau": "s \"Health Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2017\": The Census Bureau's report on health insurance coverage in the United States for the year 2017 showed an increase of 492,000 uninsured people between 2017 and 2016. This data contradicts the magnitude of the increase mentioned in Cantwell's claim.", "National Health Interview Survey by CDC": "The National Health Interview Survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found a decline of 300,000 uninsured Americans between 2016 and the first quarter of 2018 when measuring \"uninsured at the time of interview.\" However, if measuring \"uninsured for at least part of the past year,\" there was essentially no change in the number of uninsured individuals. This survey provides an alternative perspective on the change in uninsured rates."}
