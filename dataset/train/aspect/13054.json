{"The process of ripening in bananas occurs naturally due to the release of a plant hormone called ethylene": "which triggers the ripening process at specific stages of the plant's development.", "Commercially sold bananas are typically picked before they are ripe and are then exposed to trace levels of ethylene gas in specialized ripening chambers to ripen them before distribution": "3. From a chemical standpoint, bananas that have been treated with ethylene are no different from bananas that have ripened naturally, as the same substance triggers the ripening process in both cases.", "There is no visual or chemical test that can reliably determine if a banana has been ethylene": "treated or naturally ripened, according to an expert in post-harvest technology."}
