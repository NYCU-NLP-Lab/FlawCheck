{"The first aspect employed to verify the authenticity of the claim is the information provided by the expert regarding the actual financial aid programs implemented in Canada": "The expert explains that the $2,000 figure mentioned in the claim refers to the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB), which provided a monthly allowance to certain qualified Canadians who met specific criteria related to job loss, illness, caregiving responsibilities, or parental duties during the pandemic.", "Another aspect utilized to verify the claim is the comparison made between the Canadian financial aid programs and the US stimulus package": "The expert highlights that the claim criticizes the proposed $600 checks in the US stimulus package while stating that Canadians received $2,000 per month. This comparison helps to assess the accuracy of the claim and provides context for understanding the differences between the two countries' approaches to pandemic aid.", "The expert also points out that the financial aid described in the tweets does not reflect payments made to all Canadians": "They clarify that the CERB benefits had only been requested by 8.9 million unique applicants, which is significantly less than Canada's population of about 35.1 million. This information helps to debunk the notion that every Canadian received $2,000 per month in pandemic aid.", "Lastly": "the expert mentions that the first tweet inaccurately explains the small business loan program in Canada. The claim states that all small businesses received a $40,000 loan to pay back over five years, with only $10,000 needing to be repaid. However, the expert clarifies that this description is not entirely accurate, indicating that the claim's information about the small business loan program is misleading and requires further examination."}
