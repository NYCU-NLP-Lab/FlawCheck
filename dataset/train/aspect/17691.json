{"Confirmation from CIA spokesperson": "A CIA spokesperson confirmed that the claim was \"absurd\" and stated that Gina Haspel is alive and at the office. This official statement adds credibility to the authenticity of the claim.", "Refutation of baseless rumors": "The expert's verdict mentions that social media users were circulating baseless rumors about Gina Haspel's well-being. This refutation of unfounded claims helps to verify the authenticity of the original claim.", "Denial of alleged conspiracy theory": "The claim appears to stem from a baseless conspiracy theory about a U.S. military raid on a Spanish election software company. Both the company and the U.S. Army denied the occurrence of such a raid, which undermines the credibility of the claim.", "Lack of credible sources or evidence": "The expert's verdict highlights that none of the users spreading the claim provided any credible sources or evidence to support their assertions. This lack of substantiation further questions the authenticity of the claim."}
