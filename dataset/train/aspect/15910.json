{"The authenticity of the claim was verified by comparing the photo in question with a Getty Images photo of two people selling Trump sweatshirts outside the U": "S. Capitol on Jan. 6. It was confirmed that the photo is genuine and was taken by freelance photographer Jon Cherry for Getty Images.", "The accompanying caption that names the vendors as": "Nah\" and \"Stop asking me questions before you get your a-- kicked\" was found to be fabricated. This was determined by investigating the original source of the caption, which was a story labeled \"fake news\" on Medium.com. The story explicitly states that the captions added to the Getty Images photos are not real.", "The Getty Images caption for the photo": "which describes street vendors selling President Donald Trump memorabilia near the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, was compared to the fabricated caption. The inconsistency between the two captions further supported the conclusion that the fabricated caption was not authentic.", "The credibility of the claim was also assessed by considering the broader context of the U": "S. Capitol riot on Jan. 6. While many shocking images emerged from the event, the viral photo of the Trump merchandise vendors stood out primarily because of its caption. This observation suggests that the caption's provocative nature may have been intentionally added to attract attention rather than accurately represent the situation."}
