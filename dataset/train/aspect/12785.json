{"PepsiCo and Coca": "Cola pledged to remove brominated vegetable oil (BVO) from soft drinks in 2013 and 2014, and by mid-2020 it was no longer listed as an ingredient of Mountain Dew. This shows that the claim about the presence of BVO in Mountain Dew is no longer valid.", "Studies have not proven that the levels of BVO previously found in sodas like Mountain Dew had adverse health effects on humans": "This suggests that the claim of BVO being dangerous may not be supported by scientific evidence.", "BVO is a food additive that has been used in the soft drink industry to keep citrus": "flavor oils suspended in beverages. It has been commonly found in Mountain Dew and other citrus-flavored soft drinks. This confirms the presence of BVO in Mountain Dew in the past.", "BVO is allowed as a food additive in certain countries like the US and Canada": "but it is banned in others like Japan and European Union countries. This indicates that the regulatory status of BVO varies across different parts of the world."}
