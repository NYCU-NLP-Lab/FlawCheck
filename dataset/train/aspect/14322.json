{"The claim is supported by a direct quote from President George W": "Bush's memoir, \"Decision Points,\" where he mentions Sen. Joe Biden recommending partitioning Iraq into three separate entities.", "The expert": "s verdict highlights Biden's previous statements before being elected as Vice President, where he called for boundaries to be drawn for the Kurdish, Sunni, and Shiite populations. However, it questions whether this is the same as partitioning a country and mentions the heavy implications of the word \"partition.\"", "The expert refers to a May 2006 op": "ed article written by Biden and Leslie Gelb, president emeritus of the Council on Foreign Relations, where they draw a parallel between conditions in Iraq and Bosnia's ethnic turmoil. This article proposes a plan to maintain a united Iraq by decentralizing it and establishing three largely autonomous regions.", "The Biden": "Gelb article explains that under their proposed plan, each region (Kurdish, Sunni, and Shiite) would be responsible for their own domestic laws, administration, and internal security, while the central government in Baghdad would control border defense, foreign affairs, and oil revenues. It also suggests that Baghdad would become a federal zone and areas with mixed populations would receive multi-sectarian and international police protection."}
