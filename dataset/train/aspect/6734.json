{"The language of the bill": "The expert's verdict highlights that the bill defines \"prenatal murder\" and excludes naturally occurring miscarriages. However, the phrase \"no human involvement\" is broad and could potentially lead to prosecution of women whose actions could be seen as playing a role in their miscarriage.", "Complex causes of miscarriage": "The expert points out that the causes of miscarriage can be complex and difficult to understand. This complexity raises concerns that women who miscarry could be prosecuted if their actions are perceived to have contributed to the miscarriage, such as choosing cancer treatment, taking illegal drugs, or being involved in an accident while pregnant.", "Critics": "objections: The expert mentions that critics argue that the language of the bill could potentially criminalize miscarriage in various situations involving human involvement. These objections include scenarios like choosing cancer treatment, taking illegal drugs, or experiencing accidents while pregnant.", "Agreement by abortion rights advocates": "The expert notes that abortion rights advocates agree with the claim that the legislation could lead to the criminalization of miscarriage. This agreement suggests that there is a consensus among these advocates that the bill's language and potential interpretations could have serious implications for women who miscarry."}
