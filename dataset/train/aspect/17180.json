They provide examples of the quote being shared on Facebook and even appearing in a letter to the editor of a local newspaper. This demonstrates the extent to which misinformation can spread and be falsely attributed to public figures.", "The expert mentions that the federal election integrity commission": "which Schumer criticized in his column, was eventually disbanded as he had hoped.
