{"The claim made by Lara Logan on the Fox News program": "Outnumbered\" suggested that helicopters were being used in Texas to spray oil on wind turbines for defrosting purposes.", "The claim was similar to online rumors that falsely circulated a photo showing a helicopter spraying chemicals on a wind turbine in Texas": "However, the image was actually taken in Sweden and showed a helicopter spraying hot water, not chemicals.", "RWE Renewables Americas": "a company operating wind farms in Texas, confirmed that they do not use any de-icing agents on their wind turbines.", "Experts in the Texas wind industry": "including Jim Krane from Rice University's Baker Institute and Daniel Cohan from Rice University's civil and environmental engineering department, stated that they have not heard of any aircraft de-icing of wind turbine blades in Texas. Additionally, they mentioned that most wind turbines in Texas do not have de-icing equipment, as the need for it is rare in the region."}
