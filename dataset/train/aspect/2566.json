{"The claim states that": "For the first time in history, the Democratic Congress will not allow an increase in the social security COLA (cost of living adjustment).\" The expert's verdict confirms that there are two versions of the claim, one blaming \"Congress\" and the other specifically blaming \"the Democratic Congress.\" The expert focuses on the latter version.", "The expert verifies that there is a law enacted in 1972": "signed by President Richard Nixon, a Republican, which created a formula to automatically calculate the COLA every year. This formula is tied to the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W).", "The expert explains that the CPI": "W is expected to decrease this year due to lower consumer prices, low inflation from the recession, and falling oil prices. This decrease in the CPI-W would result in no COLA for the next year, as projected by the Social Security Trustees report and the Congressional Budget Office.", "The expert mentions the consequences of the COLA freeze": "including stagnant Social Security payments and a freeze in Part B premiums for Medicare. However, some seniors are exempt from this freeze based on a \"hold-harmless\" provision in the law."}
