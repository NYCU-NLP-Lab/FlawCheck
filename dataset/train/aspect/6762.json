{"The Democratic National Committee adjusted its debate qualification requirements": "allowing for Michael Bloomberg to potentially qualify for the first time. However, Bloomberg has not yet met the new requirements, so his spot on stage is not guaranteed.", "Cory Booker petitioned for a rule change to help him make the debate stage": "but the new rules implemented by the DNC are different from what Booker asked for.", "The new rules for the upcoming debates include alternative ways to qualify": "such as earning one delegate in the Iowa caucuses or polling at a certain percentage in national or early-state polls. These changes do open the door for Bloomberg, who is self-funding his campaign and not taking donations, to participate in the debates.", "While Bloomberg": "s refusal to take donations prevented him from participating in the previous debates, the elimination of the donor requirement for the upcoming debate gives him a chance to qualify based on polling numbers alone. However, it is still uncertain if he will make the stage as other candidates also have strong polling numbers."}
