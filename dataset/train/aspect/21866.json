{"Lack of credible evidence": "The expert states that there is no evidence to support the claim that Vicks VapoRub caused a child's death. They mention that in the 10 years since a reported case, no deaths have been reported, and only a few cases of breathing distress have been associated with Vicks VapoRub.", "Official warnings and guidelines": "The expert highlights that the maker of Vicks VapoRub, Procter and Gamble, explicitly advises against using the product directly under the nose and in children under the age of 2. This official warning suggests that the claim may not be authentic.", "Research studies": "The expert refers to a 2012 study that examined the effects of inhaling menthol, one of Vicks VapoRub's active ingredients. The study found that inhaling menthol increased mucus production but did not provide any examples of a child dying from it. This research supports the idea that the claim is likely untrue.", "Expert testimonies": "The expert quotes Jennifer Lowry, head of toxicology at Children's Mercy Hospital, who states that she has never heard of a patient dying from inhaling Vicks VapoRub. Lowry's expertise as a pediatric medical toxicologist adds credibility to the argument that the claim is not authentic."}
