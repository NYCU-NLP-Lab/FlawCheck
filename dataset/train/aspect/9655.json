{"The photo and text overlay": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim was based on a photo shared on Facebook featuring an image of Philippine presidential spokesperson Harry Roque and a text overlay. The specific content of the text overlay is provided, which includes the statement that poor people have no right to choose and that they are a burden for the government.", "Video evidence": "The expert's verdict also mentions that the claim circulated online shortly after Roque faced criticism for remarks he allegedly made about the Philippines' Covid-19 vaccination drive. It is stated that a video from an official briefing on January 11 shows Roque saying Filipinos cannot be \"picky\" about which coronavirus vaccine they receive. This video evidence helps verify the claim.", "Comments from Facebook users": "The expert's verdict includes comments from Facebook users who indicate that they were misled by the claim. One comment expresses that the claim is an insult to poor people, while another questions the legitimacy of the claim and asks for a link to verify it. These comments provide additional evidence of the claim's authenticity.", "Comparison with original news graphic": "The expert's verdict mentions that keyword searches on Google found the news graphic that the claim was based on. A screenshot comparison is provided, showing the photo in the misleading posts and the original news graphic from Philippine media organization GMA News. The quote in the GMA News graphic corresponds to remarks made by Roque in a press briefing, and the official transcript of the briefing contains no reference to Roque's purported quote about poor Filipinos. This comparison confirms that the claim is false and that the news graphic was doctored."}
