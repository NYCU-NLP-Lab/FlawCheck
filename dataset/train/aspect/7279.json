{"Research supports the claim": "The expert's verdict mentions that research backs up the claim made by State Sen. Stacey Campfield that drug tests can be purchased for just $4 or $5. This indicates that there is evidence to support the authenticity of the claim.", "Testimony from a drug court director": "The expert's verdict includes an emailed response from Ron Hanaver, the director of the Knox Drug Court, who confirms that drug tests can indeed be obtained for around the price mentioned in the claim. Hanaver states that they are currently using a 5-panel test that costs about $3.50, which aligns with the claim's assertion.", "Comparison to another state": "s experience: The expert's verdict mentions the case of Florida, where a similar drug testing program was implemented. It states that the cost to the state was substantial, indicating that drug testing can indeed be expensive. This comparison helps verify the claim that the cost of drug testing can vary significantly depending on the program and circumstances.", "Consideration of additional costs": "The expert's verdict acknowledges that there may be additional costs associated with drug testing programs, such as administrative expenses and potential re-tests for individuals who test positive. This recognition of potential additional costs adds credibility to the claim that the overall price tag for implementing such a program may not be as straightforward as just the cost of individual drug tests."}
