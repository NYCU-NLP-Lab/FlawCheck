{"The leaked emails from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta": "which contained brief sections of Clinton's paid remarks to Wall Street banks, were presented as evidence by Trump to support his claim of Clinton's support for open borders. However, the authenticity of these emails has not been confirmed or disputed by the Clinton campaign.", "Trump pointed to a leaked excerpt from Clinton": "s speech that contained the words \"open borders\" as evidence for his claim. However, experts argue that the use of the term alone does not necessarily confirm Trump's interpretation, as it could refer to free travel, open trade, or immigration policy.", "Trump also referred to Clinton": "s pledge to offer immigration legislation within her first 100 days in office and her support for sanctuary cities as evidence of her support for open borders. However, experts have concluded that equating Clinton's immigration plan with \"open borders\" is not accurate, as she has supported measures for border enforcement and a path to citizenship with conditions.", "The expert": "s verdict highlights that while Clinton does want to make it easier for many undocumented immigrants to obtain legal status, it does not equate to allowing anyone in the world to enter the United States without any limits. This contradicts Trump's characterization of Clinton's stance on open borders."}
