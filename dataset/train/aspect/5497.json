{"Verification of the unemployment rate": "The expert reviewed data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and the state's Department of Labor and Workforce Development to confirm that New Jersey's unemployment rate as of November was indeed 7.8 percent, as claimed by Governor Christie.", "Comparison with other states": "The expert compared New Jersey's unemployment rate with other states in the region, such as New York, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, and Delaware, to provide context. While New Jersey's rate was the highest in the region, there were eight other states with an even higher unemployment rate in November.", "Examination of historical data": "The expert analyzed unemployment rates from November 2008 onward to determine if the claim of the lowest rate in five years was accurate. They found that New Jersey's unemployment rate was lower than 7.8 percent within the past five years, specifically in November 2008, December 2008, and January 2009. However, the rate had been consistently high until April 2013 when it began a slow downward trend.", "Confirmation of improving trend": "The expert acknowledged that while the claim of the lowest rate in five years was not entirely accurate due to lower rates in the past, they verified that New Jersey's unemployment rate had been declining steadily for the past year. This confirmed the overall trend of improvement in the state's jobs picture."}
