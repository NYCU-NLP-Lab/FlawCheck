{"Genetic structure and function": "Many nutritionists and botanists consider tomatoes as fruits based on their genetic structure and function as the reproductive body of a seed plant.", "Culinary classification": "The U.S. Supreme Court, USDA, and culinary experts have classified tomatoes as vegetables based on their flavor and their role in recipes. They are commonly used in savory dishes like ketchup, salsas, and spaghetti sauce.", "Cultural and culinary practices": "In many cultures, vegetables are typically served as part of main dishes or side plates, while sweet fruits are consumed as snacks or desserts. This cultural distinction leads some nutritionists to refer to certain botanical fruits, including tomatoes, as vegetables despite their genetic traits.", "Lack of a clear rule": "There is no hard-and-fast rule that clearly designates a botanical fruit as a vegetable. Given that tomatoes are not commonly used in desserts and are closely related to other fruit-vegetables like eggplants and peppers, it is not too counterintuitive for tomatoes to be classified as vegetables."}
