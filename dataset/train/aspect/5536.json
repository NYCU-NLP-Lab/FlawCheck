{"The claim exaggerates the role played by Donald Trump in funding the 1995 Veterans Day parade in New York": "While he did donate $200,000, it was less than 10% of the total raised, according to press reports at the time.", "The City of New York did not refuse to fund the Veterans Day parade": "Trump's donation helped jump-start the fundraising efforts, but it was not the sole source of funding for the parade.", "Trump": "s donation and participation in the parade were a point of pride for him, as he called it \"one of my proudest accomplishments\" during his presidential campaign in 2015.", "The exact details of the funding and organization of the parade are not readily available": "as the United War Veterans Council, the organization that hosted the event, did not return calls and the tax forms from that year are not available online. However, press reports at the time estimated Trump's donation to be $200,000 and stated that he helped raise more funds from other businesses."}
