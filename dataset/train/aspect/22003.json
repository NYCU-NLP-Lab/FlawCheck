{"The expert checked the QDC": "s annual financial statements for the most recent fiscal year to verify the claim. These statements showed that the QDC had revenues of $8,314,944 and expenditures of $8,310,750, resulting in a net gain of $4,563.", "The expert examined the sources of revenue for the QDC and found that the bulk of the revenues": "5.2 million, came from rental income on 403 acres leased out to private companies. This indicates that the QDC does generate some income from the Quonset Business Park.", "The expert also discovered that an additional": "1.9 million was raised through utility sales to tenants of the park, including water and sewage treatment services. This further demonstrates that the QDC receives revenue from the operation of the business park.", "The expert considered the explanation provided by State Rep": "Joseph A. Trillo, who clarified that every dollar the QDC takes in goes into operating the industrial park and that there is no profit. This statement aligns with the financial statements showing a small net gain, suggesting that the revenue generated is primarily used for park operations rather than being directed into the state coffers."}
