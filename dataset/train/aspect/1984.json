{"The claim was based on an image macro featuring a picture of Ben Carson alongside a quote about illegal immigrants being stripped of citizenship if caught voting fraudulently": "This image was frequently circulated on social media in 2016.", "The quote in the image macro was a slightly paraphrased version of a sentence written by Carson in a 2014 opinion piece for WND about immigration reform": "The original sentence discussed the need for a system that disincentivizes illegal immigration and upholds the rule of law, suggesting that anyone involved in voter fraud should be deported and have their citizenship revoked.", "The context in which the sentence appeared in the opinion piece clearly suggested that the word": "anyone\" referred specifically to illegal immigrants. Although the sentence was initially published on WND, it was later removed from the online version within a few days of publication.", "The statement made by Carson in his book": "What I Believe: A Collection of My Syndicated Columns\" also included the same sentence about non-citizens caught voting illegally forfeiting the opportunity to become naturalized. This suggests that the statement was not just a simple mistake but a consistent belief held by Carson."}
