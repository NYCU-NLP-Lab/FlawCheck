{"Lack of credible online sources": "The expert found that when searching for the quote online, there were only three results, none of which were considered credible. This lack of credible sources raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Inability to find the quote in archives": "The expert used Nexis, a platform that allows users to search news story archives, to find any mention of the quote attributed to Michael Bloomberg. However, they found no evidence of Bloomberg making such a statement. This further undermines the credibility of the claim.", "Bloomberg": "s previous criticisms of Trump: The expert highlights that while Bloomberg has been critical of President Trump in the past, calling him a \"dangerous demagogue\" and \"totally incompetent,\" there is no direct evidence of him specifically making the statement mentioned in the claim. This suggests that the claim may be exaggerated or fabricated.", "Response from Bloomberg Philanthropies": "The expert reached out to Bloomberg Philanthropies for clarification on the claim. However, the response received did not directly address whether Bloomberg made the statement in question. Instead, a transcript of Bloomberg's 2016 speech at the Democratic National Convention was provided, which mentioned Trump as a \"con\" and a \"cheat.\" While this provides some context, it does not confirm the exact quote attributed to Bloomberg."}
