{"The explanation of the name WD": "40 as \"Water Displacement, 40th attempt\" is provided by the WD-40 Company, which was formerly known as the Rocket Chemical Company of San Diego.", "The claim is supported by the fact that WD": "40 was created in 1953 by three technicians at the San Diego Rocket Chemical Company, who were searching for a rust preventative solvent and degreaser for missile parts.", "The expert mentions the common practice of using numbers in product names to indicate the number of attempts made to formulate a product or its name": "This aligns with the claim that WD-40 was the result of the 40th formulation.", "The book": "The WD-40 Book\" by Jim and Tim Nyberg is referenced, which likely provides further evidence or information about the authenticity of the claim."}
