{"The claim is sourced from a media fact sheet posted online by NARAL Pro Choice America": "an abortion rights advocacy group. The fact sheet states that approximately 25,000 women in the United States become pregnant as a result of rape.", "The claim is supported by a 1996 analysis of the federally": "funded 1990-92 National Women's Study, which concluded that 5% of rapes resulted in pregnancies among women aged 12 to 45. This analysis estimated that there may be 32,101 rape-related pregnancies annually among American women older than 18 years.", "A 2000 article in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine used the 1996 analysis": "estimated rate of 5% pregnancies from rape and assumed a 50% drop in rapes since 1992 to estimate 25,000 pregnancies from rape in 1998.", "The Rape": "Abuse and Incest National Network (RAINN) reached a lower figure by using an estimate from the Justice Department's 2005 National Crime Victimization Survey. RAINN's website states that the survey's annual average of 64,080 rapes committed suggests a much lower number of pregnancies resulting from rape."}
