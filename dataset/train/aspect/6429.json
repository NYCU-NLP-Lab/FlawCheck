{"Creation of a marine monument": "The expert notes that President Obama did create a nearly 5,000-square-mile marine monument off the New England coast, which was initially off-limits to fishing and lobstering. This aspect verifies the claim that Obama took action related to the lobster and fishing industry in Maine.", "Grandfathering in lobster and crab harvesting": "The expert mentions that President Obama allowed lobster and crab harvesting to continue for seven years within the marine monument. This aspect confirms that there was no immediate impact on the lobster industry as a result of Obama's proclamation.", "Opening up the monument to commercial fishing": "The expert states that President Trump signed a proclamation to open up the marine monument to commercial fishing, claiming that Obama had no reason to stop fishing in the area. This aspect shows Trump's reversal of Obama's initiative and his attempt to address the perceived injustice.", "Lack of significant impact on the fishing industry": "The expert points out that statistics indicate that the fishing industry, apart from lobstering, has not been destroyed. It is mentioned that even if Obama's proclamation had gone into effect, a total ban on fishing in the monument may not have had a huge impact on the overall industry. This aspect suggests that the claim of Obama destroying the fishing industry is false."}
