{"Abu Bakr al": "Baghdadi was once held at a United States detention facility called Camp Bucca in Iraq.", "According to the Pentagon": "al-Baghdadi was released from Camp Bucca in 2004, during the administration of George W. Bush.", "The rumor of al": "Baghdadi's release during the Obama administration started to gain prominence in 2014, fueled by conservative pundits accusing Obama of a \"catch-and-release\" policy.", "The claim that al": "Baghdadi said \"I'll see you in New York\" as he left Camp Bucca, as well as the claim of his release in 2009 during the Obama administration, can be traced back to a 2014 Daily Beast interview with Army Col. Kenneth King."}
