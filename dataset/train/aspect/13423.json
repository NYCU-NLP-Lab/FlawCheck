Although he later took down the tweet, an archived version was accessible. This adds credibility to the claim as it was made by a prominent political figure.", "Caption in Urdu": "The video was also shared with a caption in Urdu, suggesting that it was from Mumbai. This linguistic aspect further strengthens the claim's authenticity, as it aligns with the cultural diversity of the city.", "Background conversations in Bengali": "In the video, the conductor of the bus can be heard speaking in Bengali, and everyone in the background is conversing in the same language.
