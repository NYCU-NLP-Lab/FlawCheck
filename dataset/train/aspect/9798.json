{"The origin of the photographs": "The expert confirmed that the photographs originated from the Iranian news site PeykeIran. This source, along with witnesses who have seen similar scenes in other countries, verified that the images depict a staged street act rather than an actual punishment.", "Performance nature of the act": "The expert explained that the photographs show performers hustling money from onlookers by staging a common street act. This act involves a subject seemingly allowing himself to be run over by a heavy vehicle and emerging unscathed. The expert clarified that variations of this act are performed by magicians and accomplished through various means, with no lasting harm done.", "Inconsistencies with Sharia law": "The expert pointed out that while it is difficult to make definitive statements about Sharia/Islamic law due to regional variations, the punishment depicted in the claim does not align with the principles and guidelines of Sharia law. Islamic law resources consistently state that such severe punishments are not applied to children who have not yet reached puberty or for the theft of small-value items or food by the hungry.", "Lack of amputation and specific arm involved": "The expert emphasized that the photographs do not depict any form of amputation, contradicting the claim. Additionally, the expert noted that the child's left arm is shown in the photographs, whereas the claim suggests his right arm would be amputated if the punishment was real."}
