{"The claim is based on a report called": "The Job Impact of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan\" from Christina Romer and Jared Bernstein, which projected that the stimulus plan proposed by Obama would create 3 million to 4 million jobs by the end of 2010. The report also included a chart predicting unemployment rates with and without the stimulus.", "The report projected that without the stimulus": "unemployment was projected to hit about 8.5 percent in 2009 and then continue rising to a peak of about 9 percent in 2010. With the stimulus, they predicted the unemployment rate would peak at just under 8 percent in 2009.", "The actual unemployment rate peaked around 10 percent in late 2009 and is now around 9": "5 percent, which is higher than the projections made in the report.", "The expert also mentions that there was no instance of anyone in the administration directly making a public pledge about keeping unemployment under 8 percent if the stimulus passed": "The claim seems to be based on a projection rather than a promise."}
