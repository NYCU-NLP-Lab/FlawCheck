{"The claim is based on a viral image that shows a crown of multicolored lights encircling the planet": "which is often shared on social media as a genuine photograph of the aurora borealis phenomenon seen from space.", "The image did originate with NASA": "as claimed in the caption, but it is not a genuine photograph taken from a spacecraft orbiting Earth. It is actually a screenshot from an animation created in 2005 by lead animator Walt Feimer and the NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center Conceptual Image Lab. The animation was part of the \"Live from the Aurora\" series and explains how the Earth's magnetic field causes auroras to form.", "The official NASA video": "which is a copy of the animation, is available for viewing. It demonstrates the journey of electrons along the Earth's magnetic field line to the formation site of the aurora.", "NASA has captured several videos of the aurora borealis and aurora australis phenomena from space using time": "lapses shot from the International Space Station. These videos show the interaction between electrically charged electrons and protons in the Earth's magnetic field with neutral atoms in the upper atmosphere."}
