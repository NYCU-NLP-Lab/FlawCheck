{"The video shows an iPhone encircled by a ring of fine steel wool": "2. The fire in the video appears to be a digital effect, as it comes on all at once throughout the ring, rather than gradually growing from a single spot.", "The YouTube page that posted the video provided no explanation for why the call allegedly set the wool on fire and requested someone with a deeper knowledge of physics to explain it": "4. No other reports or videos about this alleged phenomenon were found, suggesting that if phone calls could truly set steel wool on fire, it would have been discovered before 2020."}
