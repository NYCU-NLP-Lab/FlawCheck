{"Parody Twitter account": "The expert mentions that the claim originated from a parody account on Twitter. The account used a similar handle to Maxine Waters, but with two Vs instead of a W in the representative's last name. This aspect highlights the existence of a fake account that tried to imitate the real person.", "Lack of verification": "The expert points out that Maxine Waters's real Twitter account (@MaxineWaters) is verified with a blue checkmark, indicating that Twitter has confirmed its authenticity. On the other hand, the parody account is not verified. This aspect emphasizes the difference in verification status between the real and fake accounts.", "Content of the tweet": "The claim mentions that Maxine Waters used a picture of the tide receding as proof of climate change. The expert's verdict includes the actual tweet from Maxine Waters's real account, which does not contain any reference to the tide receding or using it as evidence. This aspect highlights the discrepancy between the claim and the actual content shared by the real account.", "Political context": "The expert mentions that the claim originated shortly after President Trump announced the United States' withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement. This aspect provides context to understand why politicians like Maxine Waters were expressing their disagreement on social media. It suggests that the claim might have been a response to the political situation rather than a genuine message from Waters."}
