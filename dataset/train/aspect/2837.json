{"Lack of media coverage": "The expert notes that there were no media reports covering this alleged letter from Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. This raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Inconsistent addressing": "The letter addresses Yogi Adityanath as '\u092a\u094d\u0930\u093f\u092f' (Dear), which is not the usual form of address used by Prime Minister Modi in official communications. This inconsistency suggests that the letter may not be genuine.", "Missing recipient details": "The alleged letter does not mention the name and address of the recipient in the bottom left corner, which is unusual for official correspondence. This further casts doubt on the authenticity of the claim.", "No verification from credible sources": "The expert's verdict mentions that several Twitter users tagged Alt News, a fact-checking organization, to inquire about the veracity of the letter. However, there is no mention of Alt News confirming or verifying the authenticity of the claim. The lack of verification from credible sources raises questions about the claim's authenticity."}
