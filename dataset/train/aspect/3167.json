{"The claim is based on an old": "controversial quote from Dino Rossi, a Republican congressional candidate, which was brought up by the Washington State Democratic Party on Twitter.", "The quote suggests that Rossi once suggested": "the state build homes for unwed mothers,\" indicating a potential disregard for women's rights.", "The authenticity of the claim is supported by video evidence available on YouTube": "where Rossi can be heard making the statement during an early political run in the 1990s.", "Historical context is provided": "explaining that homes for unwed mothers were prevalent in the past as a response to unmarried pregnancies, but they largely disappeared in the 1970s. However, a different kind of maternity group home model still exists today, offering support rather than coercion."}
