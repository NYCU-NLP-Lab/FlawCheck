{"Comparison of state and federal laws": "The experts would have examined the Arizona law and the corresponding federal law to verify if the state law indeed makes a state crime out of something that is already a federal crime. They would have analyzed the language, provisions, and penalties of both laws to determine their similarities and differences.", "Statements from credible sources": "The experts would have considered the statements made by credible individuals, such as conservative columnist George Will and Arizona Governor Jan Brewer, who support the claim that the Arizona law mirrors federal laws regarding immigration enforcement. They would have assessed the context and reliability of these statements to determine their accuracy.", "Examination of legal opinions": "The experts would have consulted legal scholars and analyzed their opinions regarding the constitutionality and enforcement of the Arizona law. They would have looked for arguments and analysis supporting or refuting the claim that the law allows local enforcement authorities to arrest individuals suspected of immigration violations without a warrant.", "Analysis of relevant sections of the U": "S. Code: The experts would have closely examined the two key sections of Title 8 of the U.S. Code mentioned in the claim (Section 1304e) to determine if they support or contradict the claim that the Arizona law requires individuals to carry alien registration documents, which is already mandated by federal law. They would have scrutinized the language and intent of these sections to draw their conclusions."}
