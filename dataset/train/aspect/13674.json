{"The claim is based on a photo circulating on Facebook that shows a box of Ivanka Trump brand shoes with the label": "made in China\" and a stamp that says \"tariff exempt.\" However, the image has been altered and manipulated to include the misspelled stamp, indicating that it is not authentic.", "The original photo from which the manipulated image was cropped was published by Gawker in March 2016": "While the original photo does include the \"made in China\" stamp, it does not have the misspelled \"tariff exempt\" imprint seen in the Facebook post's version.", "Ivanka Trump announced the closure of her fashion brand in July 2018 to focus more on policy in Washington": "Therefore, her brand is no longer operating, contradicting the claim that her shoe line is exempt from tariffs.", "Even if Ivanka Trump": "s brand were still in operation, her products, including footwear, would likely be affected by her father's tariffs on Chinese goods, as the items to be taxed also include many types of footwear."}
