{"Historical newspaper article": "The expert found a June 1946 newspaper article archived by the American Foundation for the Blind titled \"Wonderful Helen Keller Flies a 'Plane.\" This article provided evidence of Keller's flight in a four-engine airplane over the Mediterranean Sea.", "Eyewitness account": "The expert referred to a Glasgow-based reporter's interview with Keller and her companion, Polly Thomson. Thomson stated that Keller piloted the plane for 20 minutes using hand signals to communicate with the pilot. The reporter also noted the amazement of the plane crew at Keller's control and steady flying.", "Video evidence": "The expert discovered an unrelated video on YouTube that showed Helen Keller flying in a bi-plane over southern California in 1919. Although not directly related to the claim, this video provided additional evidence of Keller's involvement in aviation.", "Discrediting the critic": "The expert highlighted the comments made by TikTok user krunk19, who sarcastically claimed Keller was a \"liar\" and a \"monster.\" The expert pointed out that krunk19's comments were intended as satire and provided evidence to refute his claims, such as Keller's ability to sign her name and her extensive literary works."}
