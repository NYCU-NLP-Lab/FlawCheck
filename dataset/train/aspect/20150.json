{"Lack of credible source": "The expert's verdict highlights that the original claim does not disclose the name or publication of the report that would maintain the validity of the article. This lack of a credible source raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Origin of the claim": "The expert's verdict states that the claim first originated on a website called Huzlers, known for publishing joke articles. This information suggests that the claim may not be based on factual evidence but rather intended for entertainment purposes.", "Lack of evidence": "The expert's verdict mentions that there is no record of McDonald's attempting to feed diners human flesh, indicating a lack of evidence to support the claim. Additionally, the report from a Bay Area food lab found only a minute trace of DNA in a veggie burger, which is not served in American McDonald's.", "Inconsistent circulation": "The claim has been circulating on the internet for years, suggesting that it is not a recent or verified incident. The fact that the claim resurfaced in 2017 after its initial publication in 2014 further questions its authenticity."}
