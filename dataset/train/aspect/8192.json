{"Publication of the claim": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim was published on the US News House website on July 12, 2017, with the headline stating that \"John McCain is NO LONGER A SENATOR.\" This publication serves as the initial source of the claim.", "Republishing on other websites": "The verdict states that the same article was republished four days later by the Royal Column and Conservative Army websites. These republished articles do not provide any evidence to support the claim made in the headline.", "Lack of evidence in the article": "The expert's verdict highlights that the article itself consists entirely of material copied and pasted from a Salon.com opinion piece by Paul Blest from January 2016. It suggests that the 18-month-old opinion piece may have been plagiarized in July 2017 amid concerns over McCain's health.", "McCain": "s health and surgery: The verdict mentions that McCain, who was 80 years old at the time, underwent brain surgery on July 14, 2017, to remove a blood clot. This surgery left him in recovery for more than a week and caused a delay in a vote on the Republican health care plan. This aspect raises questions about McCain's ability to continue serving as a senator but does not confirm his departure from the position."}
