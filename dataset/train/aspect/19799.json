{"The claim is supported by data from the Washington Post": "s database of police shootings, which shows that more white Americans have been shot and killed by police than Black Americans between 2017 and 2020.", "The expert highlights that the numbers lack important context": "as Black Americans are killed at a much higher rate than white Americans. The claim fails to acknowledge the disproportionate rate at which Black Americans are killed by police.", "The expert mentions that the data comes with a caveat": "stating that Black Americans account for less than 13 percent of the U.S. population but are killed by police at more than twice the rate of white Americans.", "The expert also mentions that while federal agencies like the FBI and CDC track fatal shootings by police": "their data is incomplete due to voluntary reporting from police departments. The claim does not consider this limitation in the data."}
