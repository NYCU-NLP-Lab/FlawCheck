{"Multiple sources and experts have confirmed the claim": "The expert's verdict mentions that USAID's Tina Dooley-Jones, deputy mission director in Kenya, stated that globally, malaria kills a child every two minutes. This statement is supported by other malaria advocacy groups like Nothing But Nets. Additionally, the President's Malaria Initiative, headed by rear admiral Tim Ziemer, also supports the claim that a child dies every minute in Africa due to malaria.", "Varying statistics and statements": "The expert's verdict mentions that different organizations and individuals have provided varying statistics regarding the number of child deaths due to malaria in Africa. Some claim a child dies every 30 seconds, while others state it happens every two minutes. This variation in statistics raises the need for verification and fact-checking.", "Confirmation from Africa Check and World Health Organization": "The expert's verdict mentions that Africa Check, a reputable fact-checking organization, has turned to the World Health Organization data for 2015 to verify the claim. This indicates that the claim has been cross-checked and verified by reliable sources.", "High burden of malaria in Africa": "The expert's verdict highlights that Africa bears the greatest burden of malaria globally, with 90% of all deaths and a significant percentage of active cases occurring in the continent. This information reinforces the plausibility of the claim that a child dies every minute in Africa due to malaria."}
