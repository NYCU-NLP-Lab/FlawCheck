{"Lack of early online attributions": "The expert mentions that the earliest online attributions of the quote to Benjamin Franklin only go back to the 2000s, indicating that the origin of the statement is more recent than the 18th century. This suggests that there is a lack of historical evidence supporting the claim.", "Reference to Timothy Leary": "The expert mentions that the phrase \"question authority\" is sometimes attributed to Timothy Leary, who was an advocate of psychedelic drug research. This reference suggests that Leary may have popularized the phrase, but it does not provide evidence of Franklin using it.", "No citation or documentation": "The expert notes that the participant who attributed the quote to Franklin in the online discussion provided no citation or documentation to support their claim. Additionally, no other commenters attempted to attribute the quote to Franklin or provide any evidence of his usage of it.", "Absence from reliable sources": "The expert points out that the quote is absent from Benjamin Franklin's Wikiquote page and the Franklin Papers, a comprehensive digitized archive of Franklin's publications and correspondence. This absence from reliable sources further questions the authenticity of the claim."}
