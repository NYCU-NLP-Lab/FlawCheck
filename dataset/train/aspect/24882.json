{"Lack of credible sources": "The expert's verdict states that there were no credible sources to support the claim of \"Muslim ties\" to the Notre Dame fire. This indicates that the authenticity of the claim could not be verified due to the absence of reliable information.", "French government statement": "The French government issued a press release stating that the cause of the fire was unknown. This official statement adds to the evidence against the claim, as it suggests that there is no basis for linking Muslims to the incident.", "Unrelated events": "The article on the website of former Fox News commentator Kevin Jackson attempts to support the claim by mentioning a 2016 incident where a car parked outside Notre Dame contained gas tanks and documents written in Arabic. However, it is clarified by news outlets that this incident is unrelated to the fire in 2019, further undermining the claim.", "Unsupported tweet": "The claim also relies on a now-deleted tweet from Christopher Hale, who alleged that a Jesuit friend working in Notre Dame said the fire was intentionally set. However, Hale later admitted that his friend had \"zero evidence\" and that it was an \"unsubstantiated rumor,\" indicating that the tweet lacked credibility and should not be used as evidence."}
