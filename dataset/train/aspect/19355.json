{"Cuba": "s Internet access rating: Cuba has a low Internet access rating according to Freedom House, a human rights advocacy group. It is the only country in the Western Hemisphere with an Internet access rating of \"not free.\" This indicates that there are significant restrictions on Internet access in Cuba.", "Limited access to the Internet": "The expert mentions that only about 23 percent of Cubans have access to the Internet, but this number is likely inflated. Many of those who have access can only use a tightly controlled Cuban intranet that includes email and government-approved sites. Only about 5 percent of people in Cuba have access to the full World Wide Web.", "Government control and restrictions": "The Cuban government maintains almost complete control over telecommunications industries in the country. Private Internet use in homes is essentially prohibited, and accessing the Internet outside of government-controlled methods is illegal. This level of control allows the government to limit Internet access and restrict the flow of information.", "High cost and slow speeds": "The cost of accessing the Internet in Cuba is high compared to the average Cuban's salary. Even a basic computer costs more than twice the average Cuban's annual salary. Additionally, the Internet speeds in Cuba are some of the slowest in the world, making it difficult for Cubans to access and use the Internet effectively."}
