{"Inconsistent and fabricated details": "The expert's verdict highlights several inconsistencies and fabrications present in the claim. These include the mention of a non-existent hospital, the contradictory cause of death, and unattributed quotes from notable figures like Donald Trump and T.D. Jakes. These inconsistencies raise doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Confirmation from reliable sources": "The expert's verdict mentions that Nigerian Christian Contemporary music artist Frank Edwards confirmed the claim as a hoax. He provided a screenshot of a text message from Don Moen's son, denying the news of his father's death. This confirmation from a reliable source adds credibility to the verdict.", "Social media presence": "On the same day the fake article was published, Don Moen himself posted on Facebook, indicating that he was alive and well. This direct communication from the person in question contradicts the claim and serves as evidence of its inauthenticity.", "Source credibility": "The expert's verdict mentions that the HoustonChronicle-TV website, which initially published the fake story, is not associated with the reputable Houston Chronicle newspaper. Additionally, the expert's credentials are provided, stating that they are a former writer for Snopes, a well-known fact-checking organization. These details establish the credibility of the source providing the verdict."}
