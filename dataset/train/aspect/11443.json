{"Statistical data": "The expert likely analyzed official crime statistics from both Orlando and Orange County, Florida, as well as from Sweden, to compare the number of murders in each location. This would involve examining reliable sources such as government reports or law enforcement data.", "Timeframe": "The expert would have considered the specific timeframe for which the claim was made. By comparing the number of murders in Orlando and Orange County for that particular year to the number of murders in Sweden during the same period, the authenticity of the claim could be verified.", "Population size": "Another aspect that the expert would have taken into account is the population size of each location. By considering the population density and total number of residents in Orlando, Orange County, and Sweden, the expert could determine if the claim of \"50 percent more murders\" holds true when adjusted for population differences.", "Categorization of murders": "The expert may have also evaluated how murders were defined and categorized in each location. Different jurisdictions may have varying definitions or classifications of what constitutes a murder, and the expert would need to ensure that the comparison was made using consistent criteria for both Orlando, Orange County, and Sweden."}
