{"Rep": "Bobby Scott's statement: The expert's analysis includes the claim made by Rep. Bobby Scott about the United States ranking second worst in income inequality across developed countries after taxes and transfers. This statement serves as the basis for the investigation.", "Source of information": "The expert verifies that Rep. Bobby Scott obtained his information from a December 2013 article by the Pew Research Center titled \"Global Inequality: How the U.S. compares.\" This article provides the data and analysis on income inequality across developed countries.", "Method of measurement": "The expert explains that the Pew article used the Gini coefficient to measure income inequality. The Gini coefficient ranges from zero to one, with zero representing perfect equality and one representing absolute inequality. The expert highlights that the analysis focused on earnings after tax and transfers, providing a more accurate picture of income inequality.", "Comparison with other countries": "The expert compares the United States' Gini coefficient with other OECD nations to determine its ranking in income inequality. The analysis reveals that the United States ranked 10th highest in income inequality measured before taxes and transfers, but when considering earnings after tax and transfers, the United States surged to the second position, just behind Chile. This comparison confirms the claim made by Rep. Bobby Scott."}
