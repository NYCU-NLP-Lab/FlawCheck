{"The claim originated from a satirical website": "The expert's investigation revealed that the story originated from a satirical website called thuglifevideos.com, which publishes \"odd satire stories for entertainment.\"", "Lack of evidence from the Greendale Police Department": "The expert found that a keyword search on the Greendale Police Department's Facebook page yielded no results regarding the incident mentioned in the misleading posts. Additionally, a spokesperson from the department confirmed via email that they never responded to such an incident and that the article is false.", "Inconsistent details in the misleading posts": "The expert noted that the misleading posts included two images, a blurry mug shot, and a photo of someone dressed up as Santa Claus. However, the original satirical article described a similar incident involving a mall Santa but did not include these specific images.", "Historical sharing of the screenshot": "The expert discovered that the same screenshot of the misleading Facebook post had been shared multiple times since at least 2016 on various platforms, including Facebook, a website called Urreply, and a Taiwanese forum called CK101. This suggests that the claim has been circulating for several years, further indicating its lack of authenticity."}
