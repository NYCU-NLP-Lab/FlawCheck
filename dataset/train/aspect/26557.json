{"Conflation of DUIs and DWIs": "The expert points out that Rep. Roger Williams appears to be conflating DUIs and DWIs in his claim. While he references DUIs, which are offenses committed by minors with any detectable amount of alcohol in their systems, he goes on to discuss placing offenders in jail, which is more commonly associated with DWIs.", "Inaccurate statement about offenders being sent": "on their way\": The expert highlights that Rep. Williams' claim that individuals pulled over for DWIs are sent \"on their way\" with just a ticket due to jail capacity issues in Texas is inaccurate. Different jails across the state have varying levels of occupancy and practices in place to handle capacity issues.", "Lack of evidence to support the claim": "After speaking with officials at five law enforcement agencies in Texas and reviewing relevant records, the expert concludes that there is no evidence to support Rep. Williams' claim. None of the contacted agencies could provide data directly supporting the claim, and the information they did share indicated that only a small percentage of all DWI arrests are individuals suspected of being in the country illegally.", "Source of the numbers": "The expert mentions that John Etue, chief of staff to Rep. Williams, stated that the numbers used in the claim came from law enforcement officers within the 25th Congressional District, based on their personal experiences while performing their duties. However, the expert does not provide any further information or verification regarding the accuracy or reliability of these sources."}
