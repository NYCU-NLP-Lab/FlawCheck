{"The claim is based on accurate figures from federal homelessness reports": "The expert's verdict acknowledges that Gov. Newsom's figures are technically accurate based on the federal homelessness reports. This aspect verifies the authenticity of the claim by confirming that the numbers mentioned by the governor are supported by official data.", "Change in counting methodology": "The expert's verdict highlights a key change in how homeless people are counted. In the past, the reports included a large number of \"hidden homeless\" individuals, such as those temporarily living with friends or in motels. However, these individuals are no longer counted in the recent reports. This aspect raises concerns about the accuracy of Gov. Newsom's comparison, indicating that the claim may not provide a complete picture of the homelessness situation.", "Drop in homeless population": "The expert's verdict mentions that the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) reported a decrease in California's homeless population from 188,299 in 2005 to 151,278 in 2019. This aspect supports the claim's assertion that there has been a decline in the number of homeless individuals over the past decade and a half.", "Change in counting methodology affects data comparison": "The expert's verdict emphasizes that the change in counting methodology makes comparing past data to the present problematic. By no longer including the \"hidden homeless,\" the way homelessness is measured has changed significantly. This aspect further questions the accuracy of Gov. Newsom's comparison and suggests that the claim's authenticity may be compromised."}
