{"The claim is based on recent census data": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim made by Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley is based on recent census data. However, upon further investigation, it is revealed that the numbers actually come from a study conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Health Research & Educational Trust.", "The study used data from a large sample": "The expert's verdict states that the Kaiser/HRET study used data from 3,188 randomly selected employers with three or more employees. This indicates that the study had a substantial sample size, which adds to its credibility.", "The average annual premium for family coverage": "The Kaiser/HRET study found that the average annual premium for family coverage under an employer-based plan is $13,375. This specific figure adds weight to the claim made by Rep. Braley regarding the average American family's healthcare expenses.", "The distinction between total cost and out": "of-pocket expenses: The expert's verdict highlights an important distinction regarding the claim. While the total cost of health care premiums for a family is indeed $13,375, it is not the amount that the average family pays out of its own pocket. The employer pays a significant portion of this cost, which is $9,860, compared to $3,515 paid by the employee. This distinction is crucial in understanding the financial burden on families and the role of employers in healthcare coverage."}
