{"Scalia": "s statement was based on a brief by University of San Diego law professor Gail Heriot and Cleveland attorney Peter Kirsanow, who argued that affirmative action hinders black students pursuing science and engineering degrees.", "The brief cited a 1996 Dartmouth study that showed 40 percent of black students graduating with science and engineering degrees came from historically black colleges and universities": "where students typically have lower average SAT scores and high school grades.", "There is no national count of every single black scientist and where they went to school": "so it is difficult to verify Scalia's claim about the number of black scientists as a whole.", "Benjamin Backes": "an affirmative action expert with the American Institutes for Research, stated that while Scalia's claim is likely true in terms of most black scientists not attending selective research universities like the University of Texas, it may not be for the reasons Scalia suggested."}
