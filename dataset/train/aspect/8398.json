{"Testimony from employers in the 6th District": "Grothman stated that employers in his district informed him that they heavily rely on the U.S. Export-Import Bank, which supports companies in selling their products and services abroad. This testimony suggests that the district has a significant manufacturing presence.", "Comparison to other districts": "Grothman initially assumed that larger cities like Chicago would have a higher concentration of manufacturers. However, he discovered that the 6th District in Wisconsin actually has more manufacturing jobs than almost any other district in the nation. This comparison supports the claim of the district's manufacturing prominence.", "Report from the Economic Policy Institute": "Grothman referred to a January 2015 report from the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute, which utilized data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The report stated that Wisconsin ranks second in the nation in terms of the percentage of total employment consisting of manufacturing jobs. It also highlighted that the 6th District has approximately 80,000 manufacturing jobs, accounting for 22.6% of the district's workforce. This report provides statistical evidence supporting the claim.", "Mention of specific manufacturing companies": "Grothman mentioned that he received support for the Export-Import Bank from 42 businesses in his district, including notable manufacturers such as Oshkosh Corp. and Manitowoc Co. The presence of these manufacturing companies further reinforces the authenticity of the claim regarding the district's manufacturing strength."}
