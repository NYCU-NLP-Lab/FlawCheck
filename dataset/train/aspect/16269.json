{"Lack of official records": "The Department of Defense spokesman stated that they have no record or information about a special forces member being killed by a giant in Kandahar. This lack of official documentation casts doubt on the authenticity of the claim.", "Source credibility": "The claim originated from L.A. Marzulli, an author, blogger, and filmmaker known for linking modern times with biblical creatures and prophecies. While Marzulli claims to have interviewed a military contractor or soldier who witnessed the giant, the lack of specific details and the vague nature of the interviewee's account raise questions about the credibility of the source.", "Inconsistencies with existing records": "The Army's statement mentions that the only service member named Dan or Daniel who died in Kandahar in 2002 was killed in an accident involving explosives. There are no incidents or reports of a giant-related incident or a missing patrol in Afghanistan. These inconsistencies with existing records undermine the credibility of the claim.", "Motive and bias": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim gained current interest due to a video created by L.A. Marzulli, who has a clear motive to link modern times with biblical creatures and prophecies. This motive raises concerns about potential bias and the possibility of sensationalism or fabrication for personal gain."}
