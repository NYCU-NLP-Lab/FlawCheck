{"Bernie Sanders": "claim: The first aspect employed to verify the authenticity of the claim is the statement made by Bernie Sanders himself. The expert's verdict includes the direct quote from Sanders' tweet, where he states that Wisconsin payday loans have an average annual interest rate of 574%.", "Supporting evidence": "The second aspect is the information provided by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). The expert's verdict mentions that the CFPB states that the astronomical interest rates on payday loans, averaging more than 300% nationwide, make it difficult for consumers to pay back the loans in full. This supports the idea that high interest rates are prevalent in the payday loan industry.", "Center for Responsible Lending data": "The third aspect is the data provided by the Center for Responsible Lending (CRL). The expert's verdict mentions that the CRL calculated the rates for each state, including Wisconsin, based on the rates most commonly advertised for a $300 loan by the largest payday chains in each state. This data confirms that Wisconsin has one of the highest average annual interest rates on payday loans.", "Confirmation by Sanders": "spokesman: The fourth aspect is the confirmation by Bernie Sanders' spokesman, Bill Neidhardt. The expert's verdict states that Neidhardt confirmed that the tweet was based on the numbers from the responsible lending group. This confirmation adds credibility to the claim made by Sanders."}
