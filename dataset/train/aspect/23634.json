{"Lack of definitive evidence": "The expert's verdict mentions that there is a lack of definitive evidence proving the claim of rendered pets in pet food, such as DNA testing. This suggests that there is no concrete scientific proof supporting the claim.", "Presence of euthanasia drugs": "The expert's verdict acknowledges that drugs used to euthanize pets have been found in some pet foods, leading to rumors about the inclusion of rendered dead cats and dogs. This aspect highlights the existence of euthanasia drugs in pet food but does not directly confirm the presence of rendered pets.", "Urban legends and reaction": "provoking beliefs: The expert's verdict mentions that urban legends about pet food, particularly the cheapest brands, being made from rendered euthanized remains of cats and dogs are tenacious and reaction-provoking. This aspect highlights the prevalence of such beliefs and the emotional response they evoke, but it does not provide concrete evidence either way.", "Confirmation by governmental and medical entities": "The expert's verdict cites federal and state agencies like the Food and Drug Administration, as well as medical groups like the American Veterinary Medical Association and the California Veterinary Medical Association, confirming that pets are routinely rendered after death in animal shelters or by health authorities, and the end product often finds its way into pet food. This aspect suggests that there is some level of confirmation from authoritative bodies, but it does not specify the extent or frequency of such occurrences."}
