{"Timing of the crime": "The expert's verdict highlights that the timing of the crime committed by Jerry Andrew Active does not align with the claim made in the ad. Active was released from prison on May 25, 2013, and committed the alleged murder and sexual assault shortly after. This aspect suggests that the claim's assertion of Dan Sullivan approving a \"light sentence\" leading to the crime is not accurate.", "Clerical error": "The expert's verdict mentions that a clerical error resulted in a shorter sentence for Active. This aspect indicates that the shorter sentence was not a deliberate decision made by Dan Sullivan or his office, but rather an unintentional mistake. It suggests that the claim's accusation of Sullivan being soft on sex crime may be unfounded.", "Lack of evidence tying Sullivan to the crime": "The expert's verdict states that the Alaska Democratic Party, when asked for evidence linking Sullivan to Active's sentencing and the subsequent crime, only pointed out that Sullivan was attorney general when a plea agreement was negotiated with Active in March 2010. This aspect suggests a lack of direct evidence connecting Sullivan's actions to the specific crime mentioned in the claim.", "Victim": "s family request to remove the ad: The expert's verdict mentions that both campaigns pulled their ads at the request of the victims' family, who found the ad insensitive and potentially harmful to the upcoming prosecution. This aspect highlights the emotional impact of the ad and suggests that its content may not have been based on solid evidence."}
