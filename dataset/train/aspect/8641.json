These indicators support the argument that global warming is happening and its impact is being felt in coastal states like Rhode Island.", "U": "S. Rep. David Cicilline and Michael Shank, director of media strategy for Climate Nexus, are mentioned as individuals who invoked warning signs of climate change in a commentary. They argue that greater annual precipitation in Rhode Island has increased by over 12 inches in the last century, which can critically undermine marine productivity by affecting the movement and mixing of pollutants, nutrients, contaminants, and salinity levels.", "Two publications are cited as evidence for the claim": "The first is a four-page fact sheet from the University of Rhode Island's Sea Grant program, stating that precipitation in Rhode Island has increased by over 12 inches since 1905, mostly during non-summer months. The second piece of evidence is a 2008 book titled \"Science for Ecosystem-Based Management: Narragansett Bay in the 21st Century,\" which reports an increase of 13 inches in annual precipitation data from Providence and Warwick from 1905 to 2006."}
