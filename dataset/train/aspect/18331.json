{"Presentation from the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation": "The expert's verdict mentions that Governor Rick Scott's communications team pointed to a presentation from the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation. This presentation outlines the problems with PIP (Personal Injury Protection) and provides data on the increase in PIP benefits payments from 2008 to 2010. The increase in payments is seen as evidence of fraud in the system.", "Report from the state": "s insurance consumer advocate: The expert's verdict also mentions a December 2011 report from a working group written by the state's insurance consumer advocate, Robin Westcott. This report uses different numbers, specifically the \"direct variable cost,\" to measure the burden on insurance companies. The report claims that the increase in direct variable costs from 2008 to 2010 is a result of fraud and abuse in the PIP system.", "Increase in lawsuits": "The expert's verdict mentions that Insurance Commissioner Kevin McCarty wrote in a letter to the editor that the number of lawsuits doubled in the last two years. This increase in lawsuits is seen as undermining the premise of the \"no-fault\" legal system and supporting the claim of fraud in the PIP system.", "Consistency in messaging": "The expert's verdict highlights that Governor Rick Scott, Chief Financial Officer Jeff Atwater, the Florida Chamber of Commerce, insurance groups, and other advocates for PIP reform have consistently used the figure of $1 billion in PIP fraud. The fact that multiple individuals and organizations are using the same claim suggests a coordinated effort to verify its authenticity."}
