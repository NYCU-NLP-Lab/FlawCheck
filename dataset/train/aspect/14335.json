{"Inconsistencies in the news story": "The expert's verdict highlights that the claim of Saudi Arabia planning to behead six school girls for being with their male friends without parents or a guardian was found to be inconsistent with the facts. The story was flagged as potentially fabricated by Facebook users, and the website publishing the article was identified as a fake news website.", "Lack of evidence supporting the claim": "The expert's verdict mentions that the photo used in the article to support the narrative was actually a photo from Afghanistan, showing an Afghan judge hitting a woman with a whip. This indicates a lack of credible evidence to support the claim about the execution of school girls in Saudi Arabia.", "Expert opinion": "The expert consulted a researcher at Human Rights Watch (HRW) who confirmed that the story was a fabrication. The HRW researcher stated that gender mixing in Saudi Arabia can lead to criminal penalties, but not the death penalty. This expert opinion adds credibility to the verdict that the claim is not authentic.", "Execution statistics in Saudi Arabia": "The expert's verdict provides information on the number of executions in Saudi Arabia in 2017, stating that nearly all executions were for murder or drug smuggling. This statistic further supports the conclusion that the claim of school girls being executed for being with their male friends is unlikely to be true."}
