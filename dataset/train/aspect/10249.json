{"The ad claims that Doug Collins voted with Stacey Abrams to raise taxes by supporting HR 206": "a bill to fund infrastructure projects, which is referred to as \"the largest tax increase in Georgia history.\" However, the bills HR 206 and HB 277 did not actually constitute a tax increase per se. They allowed Georgia residents to vote on whether to adopt a tax, shifting the decision to the voters.", "Kelly Loeffler": "as a businesswoman, supported a regional tax increase that was included in the final version of the bills. This contradicts the ad's claim that Loeffler has never voted for a tax increase.", "The ad fails to provide crucial context about HR 206 and Loeffler": "s own position on it. It omits the fact that the bills were aimed at addressing Georgia's infrastructure issues and that proponents, including Republican business-owners, argued that the state's crumbling infrastructure hindered investment.", "While both Collins and Abrams supported HR 206 and HB 277 as state representatives": "the ad's assertion that Collins \"joined liberal Stacey Abrams to raise taxes\" is misleading. The bills did not raise taxes directly but rather allowed voters to decide on implementing a tax increase through a statewide ballot."}
