{"The photo used in the claim was taken from a news report published in February 2017": "indicating that it is not recent and does not support the claim of the family receiving welfare payments after arriving in Australia three months ago.", "The Facebook post sharing the claim has been shared more than 1": "200 times, suggesting that it has gained some traction and potentially reached a wide audience.", "A reverse image search on Google for the top photo led to a report by ABC Radio Hobart from 2017": "which states that the family arrived in Hobart five years ago. This contradicts the claim of them arriving three months ago.", "The Department of Social Services confirmed that holders of temporary student visas": "like the family in the photo, are not eligible for social security payments. This further discredits the claim of the family receiving $1,400 per week in government welfare payments."}
