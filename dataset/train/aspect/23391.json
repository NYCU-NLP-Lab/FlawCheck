{"Warren": "s financial-disclosure statement filed in December 2011 revealed that Harvard had paid her $429,981 in her capacity as a law professor for the years 2010 and 2011. This statement confirms that she was indeed paid a significant amount by Harvard, but it does not specify the exact breakdown of her duties and responsibilities for that salary.", "The salaries of college professors": "especially highly reputable academics at prestigious institutions like Harvard, are based on a multitude of factors and take into account more duties than simply teaching classes. Therefore, Warren's salary would have been determined by various factors beyond just teaching one class.", "The claim about Harvard paying Warren": "400,000 to teach one class originated from a tweet by Katie Pavlich, a Fox News contributor and editor of the right-leaning website Townhall. This tweet was made during the 2020 Democratic presidential primary, where Warren was discussing the cost of college for students."}
