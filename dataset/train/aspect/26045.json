{"The impact on future prices": "Experts were consulted to determine the potential effect of Biden's order on future prices that consumers pay for refined oil products like gasoline, diesel, or heating oil. Some experts suggested that without the Keystone pipeline, transporting crude oil would become less efficient and more costly for producers, which could eventually impact consumer prices.", "Lack of evidence for immediate impact": "There is currently no evidence to suggest that Biden's decision to halt the Keystone pipeline construction has caused a spike in oil prices affecting consumers. Several energy economics experts stated that they saw no immediate impact on the cost of oil for consumers.", "Price trend analysis": "The price of oil was analyzed between the date of Biden's order and the date of the Facebook post claiming that the pipeline stoppage made oil more expensive. The analysis revealed that the price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil and Europe Brent crude oil both trended downward during this period, contradicting the claim made in the Facebook post.", "Absence of official analyses": "The U.S. Energy Information Administration and the Department of Energy confirmed that they had not conducted any analyses on the potential effects of suspending the Keystone pipeline on oil prices. This suggests a lack of official data or studies supporting the claim that the pipeline stoppage increased oil prices for consumers."}
