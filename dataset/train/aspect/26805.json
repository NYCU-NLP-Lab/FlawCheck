{"The original source of the claim": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim originated from a 1997 National Institute of Justice study conducted by researchers Philip Cook and Jens Ludwig. This study involved a telephone survey of 2,568 households, with only 251 people answering the question about the origin of their gun.", "Data analysis and interpretation": "Cook and Ludwig analyzed the responses from the survey and found that 35.7 percent of respondents reported obtaining their gun from somewhere other than a licensed dealer. This percentage was rounded up to 40 percent, which became the basis of the claim.", "Criticism and re": "evaluation: The expert's verdict mentions that the claim has been repeated frequently by gun control advocates, but it has also faced criticism and re-evaluation. The fact-checkers at PolitiFact initially rated the claim as Mostly True in 2012 but later revised it to Half True after further examination.", "Limited sample size": "One aspect that was employed to verify the authenticity of the claim is the limited sample size of the original study. Out of the 2,568 households surveyed, only 251 people answered the question about the origin of their gun. This limited sample size raises questions about the generalizability of the findings to the entire population."}
