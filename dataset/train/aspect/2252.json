{"Preliminary results of several studies": "The expert's verdict mentions that the preliminary results of several studies show potential for the effectiveness of ivermectin as an antiviral in the treatment and prevention of COVID-19. This indicates that scientific research has been conducted to explore the drug's potential.", "In vitro study findings": "The expert's verdict highlights that an in vitro study conducted by Australian researchers showed that ivermectin effectively stopped the SARS-CoV-2 virus from replicating in cells cultured in petri dishes. This suggests that the drug has shown promise in a controlled laboratory setting.", "Lack of evidence in human studies": "The expert's verdict mentions that there is currently little evidence to suggest that ivermectin can cure COVID-19 in humans. This indicates that while the drug has shown potential in early studies, further research involving human subjects is needed to determine its safety and effectiveness.", "Small sample size study": "The expert's verdict mentions a separate study conducted in Bangladesh where 100 COVID-19 patients were treated with a combination of ivermectin and doxycycline. However, the expert notes that this study had a small sample size, which means the findings may not be representative of the larger population. This highlights the need for larger-scale studies to validate the results."}
