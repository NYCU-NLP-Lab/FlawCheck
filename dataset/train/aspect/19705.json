These fake articles originated from a website that impersonated BBC News.", "Vanessa": "s public appearances: The expert highlights that Vanessa Bryant is still alive and attended a public, televised memorial service for Kobe Bryant. She also regularly updates her Instagram page, indicating that she is alive and well.", "Inconsistencies in the articles": "The articles claiming Vanessa's death purport to be from BBC News but are only impersonating the BBC by using its logo. They also use black backgrounds for the \"suicide videos,\" which is not in line with the BBC's style. The URLs used in these articles are clearly unrelated to the BBC.", "Lack of evidence and news reports": "The expert mentions that none of the videos or links provide any evidence of Vanessa's death, and no news outlet has reported her death. This lack of credible evidence further supports the claim's inauthenticity."}
