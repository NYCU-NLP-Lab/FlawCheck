{"Forced perspective": "The expert determined that the photograph used forced perspective to make the crocodile appear larger than it actually was. This technique distorted the size of the crocodile and contributed to the misconception that it was 28 feet long.", "Original caption and source": "The expert discovered a scan of the photograph with its original caption, which indicated that it was taken in 1914 near the Roper River in the Northern Territory of Australia. While the original source of the picture is still unknown, this information helped verify the authenticity of the claim.", "Reverend R": "D. Joynt: The expert found information about Reverend R.D. Joynt, who did missionary work in Australia in the early 1900s and published a book about his expeditions in 1918. The book titled \"The Roper River Mission\" aligned with the original caption of the photograph, providing further evidence of its authenticity.", "Crocodile size comparison": "The expert compared the claimed size of the crocodile (28 feet) with known records and facts about crocodile sizes. It was determined that there has never been a recorded crocodile of that size. The largest living crocodile in captivity is 18 feet long, and the previous record holder was over 20 feet long. This information strongly suggests that the claim of a 28-foot crocodile is highly unlikely and further supports the expert's verdict."}
