{"The claim was fact": "checked by PolitiFact, a reputable source known for publishing the truth and promoting informed participation in democracy.", "The conservative Heritage Foundation": "a respected organization, provided evidence against the claim, suggesting that the claim is not accurate.", "Mitt Romney has repeatedly made the claim that the United States is": "only inches away from no longer being a free economy,\" but PolitiFact has previously rated this claim as \"Pants on Fire\" (completely false) twice before.", "To analyze the underlying question of whether the United States could be approaching socialism": "PolitiFact considered statistics such as government spending as a percentage of GDP. The data showed that government spending has increased in recent years, reaching approximately 38 percent in 2009 and 2010, which is close to the 40 percent cited by Romney. However, economists pointed out that the increase in government spending was mainly due to the consequences of the recession, which began under the administration of George W. Bush."}
