{"The Liberty Institute criticizes federal hate crimes law": "arguing that it extends additional legal protections to victims attacked because of their sexual orientation or gender. They claim that protected classes contradict equal protection under the law and can be used to silence opposition to homosexuality.", "The group argues that hate crimes laws put citizens in different classes and protect some more than others": "They believe that all crimes should be prosecuted equally without categorizing individuals or punishing thoughts.", "Jonathan Saenz": "the director of legislative affairs at the Liberty Institute, specifically points out the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act as an example of the expansion of federal legal protections based on sexual orientation, gender, and disability. He highlights that age is not included as a protected class for victims.", "The expert mentions the background of the Matthew Shepard Act": "which is named after a gay college student who was brutally murdered, and James Byrd Jr., a black man who was dragged to death. The act allows the U.S. Department of Justice to assist states in investigating and prosecuting hate crimes, even in states without specific hate crime laws. Additionally, there is a separate law that imposes enhanced penalties for hate crimes on federal property."}
