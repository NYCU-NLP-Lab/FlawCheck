{"The analysis of the House bill by the Joint Committee on Taxation": "The expert's verdict mentions that Brady's office pointed to an analysis of the House bill by the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation. This analysis provides insights into the impacts of the tax bill and helps verify the authenticity of the claim.", "Breakdown of benefits based on income ranges": "The Joint Committee on Taxation released breakdowns of how much various income ranges would see their taxes collectively increase or decrease over the next decade. By examining these breakdowns, it becomes possible to determine the share of benefits that accrue above and below the $200,000 income level, thus verifying the claim.", "Chart showing income tax side of the proposal": "Brady's office directed attention to a specific chart that shows the breakdown of gains on the income tax side of the proposal. This chart indicates that those below the $200,000 threshold receive 69 percent of the benefits, while those above $200,000 receive 31 percent. Analyzing this chart helps validate the claim.", "Consideration of all aspects of the bill": "The expert's verdict highlights that the chart Brady used only addresses the personal income tax changes in the bill, excluding other types of taxes like corporate and estate taxes. However, the Joint Committee on Taxation assessment does analyze all aspects of the bill, providing a comprehensive understanding of the benefits going to different income groups. Taking into account all aspects helps ensure the authenticity of the claim."}
