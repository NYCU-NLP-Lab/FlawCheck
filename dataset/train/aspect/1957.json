{"The claim is based on multiple studies": "The expert's verdict mentions that there have been a dozen research papers in the last six years supporting the claim that capital punishment deters murders. This suggests that the authenticity of the claim is supported by a substantial body of research.", "Specific studies are highlighted": "The expert's verdict mentions three specific studies that have received significant attention. These studies, conducted by economists and Emory researchers, are cited as providing evidence for the deterrent effect of the death penalty.", "Contrary research is acknowledged": "The expert's verdict also acknowledges that there are studies that challenge the pro-deterrence findings. These studies highlight methodological issues and question the strong claims made by proponents of the death penalty. The mention of contrary research suggests that the authenticity of the claim is not universally accepted.", "Uncertainty remains": "The expert's verdict mentions a paper by National Bureau of Economic Research fellows who concluded that there is profound uncertainty regarding whether executions actually lower or raise the homicide rate. This indicates that there is ongoing debate and disagreement among experts, further questioning the authenticity of the claim."}
