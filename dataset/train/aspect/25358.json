{"Education in Canada is a provincial matter": "with each province and territory responsible for designing its own policies and curriculum. The federal government, including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, does not have the authority to introduce changes to curricula in Canadian public schools.", "Religious education": "including the teaching of Koranic precepts or Sharia law, is not part of any province or territory's curriculum. Jennifer Burke, director of curricula for the Nova Scotia department of education, stated that there is nothing in their curriculum that has anything to do with any religion.", "Cultural practices such as female genital mutilation are not promoted or taught as acceptable in Canadian schools": "as confirmed by Julie DeVoin, director of curricula in Manitoba.", "While some provinces like Alberta": "Saskatchewan, and Ontario allow separate school boards for Protestant or Catholic schools, no other religion, including Islam, is included in this exception. The separate schools that receive public funding and provide religious instruction are limited to Christian schools. Other public schools in these provinces are not mandated to teach religious matters."}
