{"The meme used cherry": "picked figures and omitted comparative information about how the numbers of bill passage of the referenced politicians stack up against those of other senators.", "The statistics included in the meme were outdated at the time of publication": "which undermines their accuracy and relevance.", "The meme only focused on the number of bills sponsored by the politicians": "without considering the common practice of co-sponsorship.", "The meme failed to acknowledge the potential impact of failed legislation on future laws": "as provisions from unsuccessful bills can often be incorporated into later legislation."}
