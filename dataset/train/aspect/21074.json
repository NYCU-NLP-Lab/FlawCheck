This information was confirmed through research on the ad agency Tugboat, which created the commercials, and the involvement of Japanese companies like the East Japan Railway Company and All Nippon Airways.", "The videos featured digital editing": "professional skiers, and ostrich costumes to create the illusion of ostriches skiing down a mountain. This was confirmed by the marketing director of Tugboat, Kan Taniguchi, who explained that the choice of ostriches was meant to associate their speed with Japan's bullet train and create a memorable and unusual sight.", "The authenticity of the claim was debunked by experts who analyzed the videos and determined that they were not real footage of ostriches skiing": "This conclusion was reached by examining the visual effects, costume design, and overall production quality of the videos.", "The availability of the videos on YouTube": "specifically through the user JetCrow, provided further evidence that the videos were part of an ad campaign and not genuine footage.
