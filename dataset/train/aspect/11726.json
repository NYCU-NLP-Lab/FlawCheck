{"The expert": "s verdict includes a Facebook post that claims to be written by an unnamed Australian nurse warning about the dangers of infrared thermometer guns. This post has been shared over 2,000 times, indicating its potential influence and reach.", "The claim suggests that infrared thermometer guns can cause damage to the pineal gland": "which is located in the brain. However, France's National Agency for the Safety of Medicines and Health Products (ANSM) has stated that there is no exposure to infrared radiation during temperature measurement using these devices.", "Neuroscience researchers": "including Gabrielle Girardeau from France's Inserm institute, have explained that even if infrared rays were directed towards the pineal gland, they would not reach it due to the skull's barrier. Girardeau emphasizes that light, including infrared wavelengths, has a low capacity to penetrate the skull.", "Experts": "such as Mireille Rossel from the Ecole Pratique des Hautes \u00c9tudes (EPHE) and Maude Beaudoin-Gobert from Claude Bernard Lyon 1 University, have highlighted the anatomical position of the pineal gland, stating that it is located deep within the brain and would require crossing the cranial box completely to reach it. This further supports the conclusion that infrared thermometer guns do not pose a risk to the pineal gland."}
