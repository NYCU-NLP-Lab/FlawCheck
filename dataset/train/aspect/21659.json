{"The American Lung Association": "s 2017 air quality report, based on EPA data from 2013 to 2015, showed that 38.9 percent of the population was breathing \"unhealthy air.\" This supports the claim that 40 percent of Americans do not meet EPA air quality standards.", "However": "the same report also mentioned that this figure is a significant improvement from before Obama took office when 58 percent of the population was breathing unhealthy air. This suggests that there has been progress in air quality under Obama's administration.", "The Obama administration updated the standard for four out of the six air pollutants regulated by the EPA under the Clean Air Act": "This indicates that efforts were made to address air pollution and improve air quality.", "The concentrations of all six air pollutants monitored by the EPA decreased between 2010 and 2016": "which covers the majority of Obama's presidency. This further supports the argument that air quality improved during his tenure."}
