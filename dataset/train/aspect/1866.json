{"The study was a pilot clinical trial": "The expert's verdict highlights that the claim is based on a single pilot clinical trial conducted in 2013. This aspect verifies that the claim is not based on multiple studies or extensive research.", "The study included a small sample size": "The expert's verdict mentions that the study included only 21 patients suffering from Crohn's disease. This aspect verifies that the claim's results are based on a limited number of participants, which may affect the generalizability of the findings.", "Two groups were compared": "The expert's verdict explains that the study divided the patients into two groups, one receiving cannabis with THC and the other receiving a placebo. This aspect verifies that the claim's results were obtained by comparing the effects of cannabis with THC to those of a placebo, adding credibility to the findings.", "Complete remission was achieved by a minority of patients": "The expert's verdict states that only 5 out of 11 patients in the THC group achieved complete remission, while only 1 out of 10 patients in the placebo group did. This aspect verifies that the claim's assertion of \"complete remission\" is not applicable to all patients and that the majority did not experience this outcome."}
