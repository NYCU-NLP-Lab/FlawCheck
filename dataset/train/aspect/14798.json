{"The Tennessee Legislature approved a quarter": "of-a-percentage point cut in the state sales tax on grocery food, effective July 1, which contradicts the claim that previous Democrat regimes refused to make such reductions.", "The last reduction in Tennessee": "s sales tax on grocery food was actually made in 2007 by legislative Democrats, who were still in the majority at the time, and signed into law by then-governor Phil Bredesen, a Democrat. This undermines the claim that Democrats had refused similar reductions in the past.", "State Senate Speaker Ron Ramsey": "who made the claim, had previously questioned the value of a cut on the sales tax on food and revealed that he had not been a proponent of the 2007 cut. This casts doubt on his credibility in taking credit for the tax reduction.", "Ramsey": "s claim also ignores the fact that the 2007 cut in the state food tax was double the reduction he is now touting, further undermining the authenticity of his claim."}
