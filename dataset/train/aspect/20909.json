{"Comparison with previous budgets": "The expert compared Gov. Chris Christie's proposed budget with previous budgets in the state of New Jersey to verify the claim of it being the biggest spending budget. They found that while Christie's proposal is one of the largest in state history, former Gov. Jon Corzine proposed more costly budgets.", "Exclusion of federal stimulus aid": "The expert noted that the claim did not specify whether it included federal money or funds like the Transportation Trust Fund in the measurement of spending. They found that if these additional expenditures were included, Christie's proposal would indeed have more spending than previous budget plans.", "Lack of distinction in the claim": "The expert pointed out that Assembly Budget Committee Chairman Vincent Prieto did not make the distinction between different measurements of spending during the interview. Prieto's claim focused on the affordability of a tax cut considering lower-than-expected state revenues, rather than providing a comprehensive analysis of the budget.", "Verification from a spokesperson": "A spokesperson for the Assembly Democrats, Tom Hester Jr., confirmed that Prieto's point about the budget being the largest in the nation at that point in time was accurate. However, this verification was based on a broader measurement of spending that included federal money and off-budget expenditures."}
