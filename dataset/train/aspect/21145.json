{"The expert fact": "checked the claim that 65% of gun deaths in America are from suicides by referring to an annual report issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in June 2019 titled \"Deaths, Final Data for 2017.\"", "The expert found that according to the CDC data": "there were 38,882 deaths by firearms in 2017, and 23,854 were suicides, which accounts for 61.4% of gun deaths. This percentage is slightly lower than the claim made by Del. Jason Miyares.", "To further validate the claim": "the expert computed 10 years of statistics from 2008 to 2017 and found that out of 335,746 gun deaths, 208,287 were suicides, resulting in an average of 62%.", "The expert also obtained the source of Miyares": "claim, which was an article in The Atlantic that referred to CDC data and stated that suicides account for 60% of the country's gun deaths. Although slightly different from Miyares' claim, this supports the general notion that a significant proportion of gun deaths in America are due to suicides."}
