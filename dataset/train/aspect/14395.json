He has emphasized that there is no risk-free process, but the agencies have improved their screening capabilities in recent years.", "The expert points out that Comey never explicitly said that federal agencies": "cannot vet\" refugees, as claimed by Ted Cruz. Instead, Comey has acknowledged the risks associated with bringing individuals from conflict zones and the challenges in screening them.", "The expert mentions that the Cruz campaign forwarded a report on Comey": "s concerns over a bill proposed by Republicans to toughen the refugee vetting process. The bill would require Comey and other top national security officials to personally certify every refugee admitted into the United States as not a security threat. Comey stated that he couldn't provide such certification, but this does not mean that the agencies are unable to vet refugees."}
