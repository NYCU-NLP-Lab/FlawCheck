{"The claim is supported by Sen": "John McCain's statement in an interview where he mentioned the approval rating of Congress being down to 13 percent.", "The expert mentions that multiple reputable polls": "including NBC News/Wall Street Journal, Gallup, Fox News, and AP/Ipsos, conducted around the same time period, reported approval ratings ranging from 19 to 23 percent, with a margin of error of 3 to 4 percentage points.", "The expert highlights the director of survey research at the Pew Research Center for the People": "the Press, Scott Keeter, who confirms that approval ratings for Congress have steadily dropped and that the 13 percent figure mentioned by McCain is not out of line with other recent polls.", "The expert concludes that while McCain may have chosen the most dramatic figure to make his point": "the overall picture presented aligns with the public's dissatisfaction with Congress, making the claim authentic."}
