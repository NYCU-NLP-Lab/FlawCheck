{"Video evidence": "A video shows protesters taking shields, signs, and other supplies from the back of a U-Haul truck in Louisville, Ky. Some of the signs bear a symbol associated with antifa activists, and the truck's driver has a history of anti-fascist organizing.", "Eyewitness testimony": "An eyewitness stated that they did not see any weapons in the U-Haul truck. This testimony adds to the verification process and contradicts the claim that weapons were distributed.", "Lack of evidence for weapons distribution": "No evidence could be found to support the claim that antifa activists distributed weapons at the protests. This further discredits the claim and supports the authenticity of the eyewitness testimony.", "Disinformation origins": "The claim that the U-Haul truck is linked to a George Soros-funded initiative appears to have originated on forums known for spreading disinformation. There is no connection between the billionaire philanthropist and the truck, indicating that the claim is false."}
