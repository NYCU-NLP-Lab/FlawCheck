{"The image of the wet dog surrounded by otters was originally posted on Reddit with a humorous caption": "suggesting it was a recent photograph.", "The image was found to be digitally edited": "as the dog was not present in the original photograph.", "The original photograph": "without the added dog, was traced back to the Cape May Bird Observatory in New Jersey. However, the picture is no longer hosted on their website.", "The authenticity of the claim was further debunked by highlighting another fake image of Dave Grohl surrounded by otters": "indicating a pattern of manipulated photographs."}
