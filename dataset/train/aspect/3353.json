{"The study that was cited as evidence for the claim was thoroughly examined": "The expert looked at the South Willamette River Crossing Study from May 1999, which showed that approximately 70% of the trips across the bridge originated or ended in Clackamas County.", "The expert analyzed the pie chart from the study and found that 50": "of the trips were between Clackamas County and Portland, 13% were between Clackamas and Washington counties, and 7% were between different parts of Clackamas County. This data supported the claim that a significant portion of the traffic on the Sellwood Bridge was to/from Clackamas County.", "The expert also considered additional information from the pie chart": "which showed that 17% of trips were between the east and west sides of Portland, and 13% of trips were between Portland and Washington County. This added context indicated that 80% of the trips either originated or ended in Portland, providing a broader perspective on the traffic distribution.", "The expert consulted a Clackamas County reporter from The Oregonian": "who stated that the claim had not been debunked because it was factually correct. This input provided further validation of the claim's authenticity and undermined the opposing argument that the claim had been thoroughly debunked."}
