{"Lack of evidence": "The expert's verdict states that there is no basis or evidence to support the claim that Facebook is removing photographs of military amputees. This lack of evidence is a key aspect in verifying the authenticity of the claim.", "Facebook guidelines": "The expert mentions that no published Facebook guidelines make any reference to photographs of military amputees being unacceptable or offensive. This suggests that the claim is not in line with Facebook's community standards, further questioning its authenticity.", "Presence of similar images": "The expert points out that there are many images featuring amputees, including military personnel, that have been consistently visible on Facebook. The fact that such images are commonly shared on the platform contradicts the claim that Facebook is removing them.", "Inclusion of supposedly banned photograph": "The warning message that circulated on Facebook, claiming the removal of amputee photographs, actually included a photograph of a military amputee. The fact that this message was shared countless times on Facebook, including the supposedly banned image, undermines the credibility of the claim."}
