{"The claim is supported by a statement from State Rep": "Bill Proctor, who is a chair of a House education committee and chancellor at Flagler College. Proctor stated that \"right now, 50 percent of Florida students leaving high school cannot read at grade level.\"", "The claim is backed up by the results of the Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test": "FCAT), which is taken by Florida high school students in the 10th grade. During the 2010-11 school year, only 39 percent of nearly 186,000 10th graders scored a \"3 or higher,\" which is considered reading at grade level.", "The claim is further supported by the fact that students who fail the 10th grade FCAT have two opportunities per year to retake the test": "This suggests that there are students who initially do not meet the grade level reading requirement but eventually pass the test, indicating that there is a significant number of students graduating without reading at grade level.", "The claim is also supported by a report from the Florida Department of Education": "which indicates that there are \"significant numbers of students\" who are not reading at grade level and are still being allowed to graduate. This report further strengthens the authenticity of the claim."}
