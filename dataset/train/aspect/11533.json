{"The claim was verified by speaking to the District Information and Public Relations Officer": "Karnataka Govt, Mr. Shasi Saduddin, who clarified that the laptops seized had the Chief Minister's picture and not Jignesh Mevani's picture. This statement from an official source adds credibility to the verification process.", "The news of the 160 laptops seized with Jignesh Mevani": "s image was reported by The New Indian Express, but it was contradicted by The Hindu, which reported that the laptops were first distributed in January 2018. This contradiction raises doubts about the accuracy of The New Indian Express' report.", "The timing of the news is also a factor in verifying its authenticity": "The laptops were seized on March 31, while Jignesh Mevani was charged with making incendiary remarks against Prime Minister Narendra Modi on April 6. This discrepancy suggests that the claim of Mevani's image being on the laptops is false.", "The expert": "s verdict also highlights the potential callousness on the part of The New Indian Express in reporting false information. This raises questions about the newspaper's credibility and their fact-checking processes."}
