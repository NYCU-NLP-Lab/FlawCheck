{"The belief in the effectiveness of background checks in reducing gun violence is widely held among Americans": "with around 90 percent supporting them on every gun sale.", "Research conducted by the gun control advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety compared the rates of gun violence in states with comprehensive background checks for private sales to states without such laws": "It found that states with background checks had roughly a 50 percent lower rate of gun violence in categories such as intimate partner violence, suicides by gun, and law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty.", "However": "experts caution that the stark differences observed between states with and without background checks do not provide unequivocal proof of the effectiveness of background checks. They argue that other variables, such as relative levels of gun ownership, need to be controlled for to establish a cause-and-effect relationship.", "Additional research by Daniel Webster and colleagues focused on the impact of a Connecticut law requiring handgun purchasers to obtain a license on subsequent homicides": "This study provides further evidence but also acknowledges the need for controlling for other factors to draw definitive conclusions about the effectiveness of background checks in reducing gun violence."}
