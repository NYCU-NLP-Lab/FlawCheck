{"The source of the claim": "The expert identified that the claim originated from a website named World News Daily Report, which is known for publishing fictional and satirical stories. The website's disclaimer clearly states that all characters appearing in its stories are entirely fictional.", "Lack of credible sources": "The expert found that the World Daily News Report's zookeeper story was shared on various African websites, but these websites reproduced the same details without providing any additional credible sources. The original hoax also cited a non-existent Indonesian news outlet named the Kalimantan Press as the source of the story.", "Dismissal by zoo officials": "The expert discovered that officials at the Indonesian zoo dismissed the story as a hoax when it first emerged in 2015. The zoo did not have an orangutan named Marilyn nor a director named Abdoel Hakim, who was quoted in the World News Daily Report story. The zoo chief, Aschta Boestani, confirmed that the story was \"not true\" in an article debunking the claim.", "Inconsistent evidence and lack of scientific support": "The expert highlighted that the photos used in the false posts were not related to the Indonesian zoo in question. The picture of the orangutan was taken at a different location, while the origin of the man's photo could not be identified. Furthermore, the expert mentioned that there is no documented case of a human impregnating an orangutan, and scientific studies investigating interbreeding between humans and other species have provided inconclusive evidence."}
