{"The claim is based on a video ad launched by Mike Collier": "the Democratic nominee for state comptroller, suggesting that Glenn Hegar expressed pride in legislated cuts to public school funding. The ad features a narrator stating that Hegar \"voted to cut more than $5 billion from Texas schools, money for teachers, computers, even books -- all cut.\" This claim is supported by the video footage of Hegar saying, \"But I was not ashamed to say we didn\u2019t. I was proud that we did not.\"", "The expert": "s verdict mentions that a news account raised doubts about why Hegar was proud, prompting further investigation into the claim. This suggests that the authenticity of the claim was verified by examining the context and sources surrounding Hegar's statements.", "The expert also refers to a press release issued by Hegar in 2011": "where he expressed pride in lawmakers balancing the budget without tapping into the rainy day fund or raising taxes. While Hegar did not directly mention the school cuts, his statement indicated a sense of pride in a fiscally responsible budget that funded essential services. This additional evidence supports the claim made in Collier's ad.", "The authenticity of the claim was further verified by Collier": "s spokeswoman, who confirmed that the claim was based on Hegar's comments during a videotaped meeting with the Montgomery County Tea Party. The specific comments made by Hegar during this meeting, where he mentioned favoring smarter and cheaper education, were used to support the claim that he expressed pride in the cuts to education funding."}
