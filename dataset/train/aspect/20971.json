{"Multiple Facebook streams were shared": "with some of them being pulled down. These streams were shared on a Kenyan Facebook group with a large following, as well as on other platforms, claiming that the looting was happening in the Mexican port city of Veracruz.", "The same footage used in the Facebook streams was also shared on Facebook as regular clips and on YouTube": "with similar claims of looting in Mexico. However, some viewers questioned the authenticity of the footage as it appeared to be playing on a loop, with the same scenes repeating every few minutes.", "Further investigation revealed that the footage used in the streams was actually from a video published on YouTube three years ago": "The video showed looting that occurred during protests against a gasoline price hike in Mexico in 2017. This suggests that the claim of looting due to coronavirus panic was misleading and not related to the current pandemic.", "The misleading stream came at a time when there were reports of stores being robbed and online calls for looting in Mexico due to the pandemic": "However, the use of unrelated footage from 2017 in the Facebook streams undermined the authenticity of the claim."}
