{"The claim originated from a satirical website": "The expert's verdict highlights that the claim was published on The Last Line of Defense (The Resistance), a known spoof site that produces satirical content. The site's disclaimer clearly states that its articles should be considered satirical and may include unreliable information.", "Lack of verifiable sources": "The expert's verdict mentions that the article does not provide any credible sources or evidence to support the claim. It does not reference any official statements, documents, or reliable news sources that confirm President Trump signing such an executive order.", "Inconsistent formatting of the alleged executive order": "The expert points out that the alleged executive order mentioned in the article is identified as \"EO 125gh2098i265mmn3.\" This format does not align with the typical five-digit numbering system used for real executive orders. This inconsistency raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Warning signs within the article": "The expert's verdict highlights several statements within the article that indicate its satirical nature. For example, phrases like \"It has been estimated that for every tax dollar you pay, 91 cents goes to providing free stuff for poor people just so they\u2019ll keep voting Democrat\" and \"Those unable to care for themselves will be deported to their native lands or placed in work camp programs\" demonstrate exaggerated and unrealistic scenarios, further discrediting the claim."}
