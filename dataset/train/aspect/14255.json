{"The claim is based on anonymous emails that allege Barack Obama wants to": "unilaterally disarm our nation\" and claim to have a video as evidence.", "The emails urge recipients not to fact": "check the claim on websites like Snopes but instead watch the video to verify the claim.", "The video linked in the emails does not actually show Barack Obama stating that he wants to disarm the United States": "Instead, it shows him discussing his defense policies, including ending the war in Iraq, reducing wasteful defense spending, and negotiating with Russia to reduce nuclear weapons.", "The source of the video is found on the official Obama campaign website": "where the full version of the video includes opening and concluding remarks emphasizing the elimination of wasteful spending and prioritizing the protection of the American people. The video was created while Obama was campaigning for the Iowa caucuses and seeking the endorsement of Caucus4Priorities, a group advocating for diverting defense spending to domestic issues."}
