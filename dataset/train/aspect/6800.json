{"False and misleading claims on jobs": "wages, energy, immigration, and more were made in the president's address.", "The claim that the economy is the best it has ever been is not true": "as GDP growth has been higher in previous years.", "The rate of job growth has actually slowed down under Trump": "with fewer jobs added in the 35 months after he took office compared to the 35 months before.", "While the unemployment rate is indeed low": "Trump's claim that it is solely due to reversing the economic policies of the previous administration is an exaggeration."}
