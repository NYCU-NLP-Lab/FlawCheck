{"The video clip in question was found to be cropped and presented in a manner that misrepresented the original context": "The president's statement was actually referring to a new law to punish child rape offenders, not a blanket provision for death penalty for all rape cases.", "The claim made in the viral message on social media was found to be misleading and exaggerated": "While there have been amendments and bills introduced to strengthen laws against rape, such as The Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013, The Criminal Law (Amendment), 2018, and The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Amendment) Bill, 2019, none of these laws introduce a blanket provision for death penalty for all rape cases.", "The expert": "s investigation also found that the viral video was shared by a Facebook account named Tanuj Thakur, which had a significant reach with over 5 lakh views and 25,000 shares. This raises questions about the intention behind the dissemination of the misleading claim and the potential impact it may have on public perception."}
