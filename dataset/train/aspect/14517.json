{"The language used in the advertisement": "The expert points out that it is unlikely for such an ad to be offered in English to an American audience, as it does not make sense for someone in the United States to be inspired to fly to Central America or southern Mexico to meet the caravan.", "The website hosting the ad": "The expert highlights that the website, NerdyHire.com, has a track record of posting ads with claims to be hiring for \"$24-$45/Hr.\" for various job classes, including unrelated ones like \"drug cartels,\" \"Jews,\" and \"terrorism.\" This suggests that the website may not be legitimate.", "Verification through online search": "Searching the term \"nerdyhire\" on Google leads to a page with various job postings, but the NerdyHire website itself does not offer jobs for \"$24-$45/Hr.\" This indicates that the website's ads may dynamically incorporate search terms entered by users to attract attention.", "Lack of response from NerdyHire": "The expert mentions that they reached out to NerdyHire to inquire about the false impressions created by their ads but received no response. This lack of engagement from the website further raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim."}
