{"The photograph": "s obscurity: The expert points out that it is highly unlikely that a powerful and memorable photograph depicting a mother and child being shot by Nazis would have remained obscure until 2015, given the extensive study and documentation of the Holocaust over the past 70 years.", "Widespread circulation timeline": "The earliest versions of the photograph found by the expert were dated May 2014, but it didn't achieve widespread circulation until late 2015. The delayed circulation raises doubts about its authenticity, considering the extensive cataloging of Holocaust horrors on the internet.", "Source of the image": "Skeptical readers noticed that the image appeared as if it had been captured from a television screen. Upon investigation, it was discovered that the \"photograph\" was actually a still from the 1988 Holocaust-themed miniseries War and Remembrance. This finding confirms that the image is not an authentic photograph from the Holocaust.", "Comparison to other verified claims": "The expert mentions that not all newly uncovered Holocaust history is inauthentic. They provide an example of the claim regarding Anne Frank's prospective refugee status, which was initially questioned but later substantiated with information uncovered a few years before. This comparison highlights the importance of verifying claims and the existence of authentic Holocaust-related discoveries."}
