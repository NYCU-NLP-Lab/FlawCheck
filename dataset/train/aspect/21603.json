{"Lack of evidence": "The expert's verdict states that there is no evidence to support Trump's claim that Hillary Clinton deleted emails from her private server after receiving a subpoena from Congress. This lack of evidence undermines the authenticity of the claim.", "FBI investigation": "The expert mentions that an FBI investigation found no evidence of a cover-up regarding the deletion of emails by Hillary Clinton. This investigation adds credibility to the conclusion that the claim is not authentic.", "Published reports": "The expert highlights that various sources, including the Washington Post and CNN, could not find any published reports to back up Trump's allegation about Putin using a racially derogatory term. The absence of corroborating reports weakens the claim's authenticity.", "Alternative interpretation": "The expert points out that an article from the Conservative Tribune, which Trump's claim could potentially be based on, actually referred to the \"N-word\" as \"nuclear\" in the context of ISIS strategy. This alternative interpretation undermines the credibility of Trump's claim."}
