{"The claim is supported by the prepared text of Attorney General Eric Holder": "s speech at the NAACP convention in 2012, where he mentioned the percentages of 8 percent for white voting-age citizens and 25 percent for African-American voting-age citizens lacking government-issued photo IDs.", "The claim is also supported by a fact check conducted by PolitiFact in January 2012": "which rated a similar claim made by Democratic U.S. Reps. Steny Hoyer and John Lewis as Mostly True. The fact check referred to a 2006 survey conducted by the Brennan Center for Justice, which found that up to one in four African Americans did not have the necessary forms of identification to vote under state photo ID laws.", "The Brennan Center for Justice": "a reputable research and legal advocacy organization, conducted research on the impact of photo ID laws on voting rights. In their October 2011 report, they stated that in five states where photo ID laws were scheduled to take effect in 2012, approximately 3.2 million Americans, accounting for about 10 percent of the states' voting-age residents, lacked government-issued photo IDs.", "The fact that the State of Texas": "led by Attorney General Greg Abbott, sued the government to win judicial approval of the law requiring government-approved photo IDs for voting further supports the claim. This legal battle indicates that there is a disagreement regarding the impact of the law on minority voters, suggesting that a significant percentage of African-American voting-age citizens may lack government-issued photo IDs."}
