{"The historical context of the claim": "The expert's verdict provides information about the ratification of the 16th Amendment in 1913, which legalized a federal income tax. This aspect helps verify the claim by establishing the existence of an income tax before 1913.", "The specific tax rates and exemptions": "The expert's verdict mentions that the 1913 law imposed a tax of 1 percent on income up to $20,000, with exemptions for the first $3,000 of income for individuals and the first $4,000 for joint filers. This aspect confirms that not all Americans were subject to a 0 percent income tax rate before 1913.", "The historical precedent of income taxation": "The expert's verdict highlights that Americans first paid an income tax in 1861 to cover the expenses of the Civil War. This aspect demonstrates that the claim of a 0 percent income tax rate until 1913 is inaccurate, as income taxation existed prior to that year.", "The Supreme Court ruling on income tax": "The expert's verdict mentions that the U.S. Supreme Court declared an income tax unconstitutional in 1895 because it was not apportioned according to the population of each state. This aspect further supports the existence of an income tax before 1913 and the claim's inaccuracy."}
