{"Low": "resolution photos: The expert identified that the photos circulating online were of low resolution and did not provide clear evidence of a giant anaconda. Higher resolution versions of the photos revealed that the items pictured were actually toys, indicating that the images were not authentic.", "Student project": "The expert discovered that the images were created for a student project titled \"Vietnam Army caught the giant snake\" in 2010. While some real (but dead) snakes may have been used for the project, the expert confirmed that the depicted animal was not the world's largest anaconda.", "Fake YouTube video": "Another image purportedly showing the giant snake originated from a YouTube video published in 2012. The expert determined that the video was fake based on the claim that the snake was at least 75 feet long, which is more than twice the size of the largest snake on record. Additionally, the video was uploaded by a cryptozoologist known for employing digital manipulation in his work.", "Manipulated photographs": "In June and July 2015, different fake photographs were attached to the claim by various sources. These manipulated images were created by altering regular-sized snake photos to make them appear as if they were the world's largest snake. The expert noted that these photographs contained several giveaways indicating their inauthenticity, such as the claim of a 134-foot-long snake, which is more than four times longer than the largest known anaconda species."}
