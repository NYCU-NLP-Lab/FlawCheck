{"Voting record": "The expert's verdict mentions that the authenticity of the claim was verified by examining Diane Black's voting record on a series of short-term funding measures, known as \"continuing resolutions,\" which keep the government running at current funding levels. This aspect involved analyzing how Black voted on these resolutions, specifically in relation to health-care funding.", "Comparison with other opponents": "The expert's verdict also mentions that the claim was verified by comparing Black's voting behavior with that of other opponents of health-care reform, such as U.S. Reps. Michele Bachmann and Steve King. This aspect involved assessing whether Black's votes aligned with those who were against the continuing resolutions to allow health-care funding to continue.", "List of supported amendments and bills": "Black's campaign spokeswoman provided a list of more than two dozen amendments and bills that Black had supported, which aimed to either repeal the health-reform law in its entirety, dismantle parts of it, or block mandatory funding for the law. This aspect involved examining the specific amendments and bills that Black had backed to determine her stance on health-care funding.", "Chronological context": "The expert's verdict mentions that Black was not even in Congress when the House gave final approval to the health-reform bill in March 2010. This aspect involved considering the timing of Black's entry into Congress and her ability to actively vote on funding for Obamacare."}
