{"Failed nuclear projects by utility provider Duke Energy": "The expert's verdict mentions the failed nuclear projects by Duke Energy as the basis for the claim. These projects, including the Crystal River nuclear plant and the planned nuclear plant in Levy County, were botched and ultimately abandoned, costing Floridians millions of dollars.", "SB 888": "The expert's verdict highlights Senate Bill 888, which was passed in 2006 and allowed Duke Energy and Progress Energy (which later merged with Duke Energy) to charge customers an \"advance fee\" to pay for the failed nuclear projects. This bill was signed by Governor Jeb Bush, not Charlie Crist.", "Amendment with SB 1472": "In 2012, the state amended the law with Senate Bill 1472, which imposed a 10-year time limit for utility companies to start their projects. The state GOP claimed that this amendment, signed by Governor Rick Scott, stopped the alleged \"Crist giveaway.\" However, the amendment did not affect the past collections of advance fees from customers.", "Settlement with Duke Energy": "The Florida Public Service Commission settled with Duke Energy in October 2013 for the two failed projects. Customers were burdened with $3.2 billion in expenses, while insurance covered $835 million, and shareholders also had to bear a portion of the costs. This settlement further supports the authenticity of the claim regarding the financial impact of Duke Energy's failed projects."}
