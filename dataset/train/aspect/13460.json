{"Comparison of fundraising numbers": "The expert compared the fundraising numbers of President Obama and Mitt Romney to verify the authenticity of the claim. They found that there were too many unknowns to determine if Obama's prediction of being outspent would come true.", "Analysis of previous elections": "The expert analyzed previous elections involving Democratic incumbents facing Republican challengers, specifically the races between President Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan in 1980, and President Bill Clinton and Bob Dole in 1996. They found that these examples contradicted Obama's claim of being the first president in modern history to be outspent.", "Examination of public financing system": "The expert explained that the earlier races occurred when candidates accepted public financing for their general election campaigns. They highlighted that Obama opted out of this system in both 2008 and 2012, as he could raise more money on his own. This aspect helped provide context to the claim and its potential validity.", "Consultation with campaign fundraising experts": "The expert consulted with Bob Biersack, a former official at the Federal Election Commission, and Clyde Wilcox, a Georgetown government professor, to gather insights and information regarding the claim. Biersack provided information on the 1980 race, while Wilcox shared his expertise on Carter's popularity and the use of public campaign financing. These consultations added credibility to the analysis and verification process."}
