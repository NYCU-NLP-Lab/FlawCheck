{"Lack of credible sources": "The expert's verdict highlights that the claim originated from an unreliable website, USA Supreme, which provided no evidence or credible sources to support the statement made by Julian Assange.", "Limited appearance of the alleged quote": "Despite the claim being widely circulated on multiple websites, the expert's investigation found no other instances of the alleged quote from Julian Assange, apart from the USA Supreme article. This lack of corroboration raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Absence of supporting information": "The USA Supreme article did not provide any specific details regarding the date of the interview, a link to the interview itself, or an explanation of how they obtained this information. The lack of supporting information further undermines the credibility of the claim.", "No confirmation from involved parties": "The expert notes that neither John Pilger nor WikiLeaks made any reference to the claim on their official platforms, such as Twitter, where Assange frequently communicates. The absence of any confirmation or acknowledgment from the parties involved casts doubt on the veracity of the claim."}
