{"The claim originated from a satirist and comedian": "Andy Borowitz, who published a Facebook post stating that Donald Trump was furious at Jeff Bezos for offering free one-day shipping for mail-in ballots in the 2020 elections.", "The post was categorized as humorous or satirical in nature": "as it was published on a comedian's Facebook page that describes its output as such. The page's \"About\" section links to Borowitz's writings for The New Yorker's \"The Borowitz Report,\" which is known for its satirical content.", "The authenticity of the claim was further debunked by highlighting that Amazon": "s involvement in the mail-in voting process is unfounded. While various states planned to expand voting-by-mail due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Amazon's reliance on the U.S. Postal Service for package delivery does not imply their involvement in the voting process.", "Additional sources were provided to support the debunking of the claim": "including articles from Al Jazeera English, The New York Times, Snopes, and the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, which discussed topics related to Trump's stance on mail-in ballots, online retailers' support for the Postal Service, the risk of voter fraud, and the process of voting by mail/absentee voting."}
