{"Series of photographs": "The authenticity of the claim was verified by analyzing a series of photographs that were circulated on social media. These photographs purportedly showed a real mermaid in the Oman Gulf in December 2017.", "Breathing video": "Another aspect employed to verify the authenticity was a video that was posted online. The video supposedly showed the mythical creature breathing, adding to the claims of its existence.", "Varying locations": "The inconsistency in the locations where the mermaid was claimed to be discovered helped in debunking the authenticity of the claim. It was noted that the images were shared with different locations ranging from London to Dubai to India, which is a common tactic used in hoaxes.", "Animatronic sculpture": "The final aspect that helped in determining the claim's authenticity was the discovery that the \"mermaid\" was actually an animatronic sculpture. Additional information was found, stating that the sculpture was made of wood and fiber, with a motor in its throat to simulate breathing. This confirmed that the mermaid was a man-made creation rather than a genuine creature."}
