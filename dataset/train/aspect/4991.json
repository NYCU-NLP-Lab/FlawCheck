{"The number of soldiers with prescriptions": "The claim states that about 106,000 soldiers had a prescription of three weeks or more for pain, depression, or anxiety medication. The expert's verdict confirms this number, indicating that the authenticity of the claim is based on the information provided in the Army's Health Promotion, Risk Reduction, and Suicide Prevention Report.", "Factors contributing to the increase": "The expert's verdict mentions that the study documented complex pressures, including long deployments, tolerance for high-risk behavior, lax standards for leaders, and increased use of prescription medications. These factors contribute to the growing number of soldiers experiencing mental health issues and the need for active steps to prevent suicides.", "Impact of deployments and injuries": "The expert's verdict highlights the impact of multiple deployments and physical injuries on soldiers' mental health. It mentions soldiers who have been on multiple deployments, carrying heavy equipment and suffering from painful injuries. This aspect verifies that some soldiers require pain medication due to their physical condition rather than a behavioral health issue.", "Suicide rates and comparison to civilian population": "The expert's verdict refers to the Army's suicide rate, which began increasing in 2004 and surpassed the national average in 2008. It states that in FY 2009, 160 active duty soldiers took their lives, making suicide the third leading cause of death among the Army population. This aspect confirms the seriousness of the issue and supports the claim's assertion that the Army needs to take more active steps to address the growing number of suicides."}
