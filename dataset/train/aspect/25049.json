{"The claim is based on a widely": "shared meme posted on the right-wing junk news Facebook page \"Uncle Sam's Misguided Children.\" The meme includes a screenshot from the GoFundMe website, suggesting that liberals started a campaign to raise $5,000,000 for murder suspect Cristhian Rivera's bail.", "The authenticity of the claim is questioned due to the source of the information": "Uncle Sam's Misguided Children\" is known for spreading misinformation and conspiracy theories, which raises doubts about the accuracy of the meme.", "The claim is further scrutinized by the fact that it was promoted by Laura Loomer": "a self-described \"investigative journalist\" with a history of fabricating and perpetuating conspiracy theories. Loomer's involvement adds another layer of skepticism to the authenticity of the claim.", "The expert": "s verdict highlights that the investigation into Mollie Tibbetts' murder and Cristhian Rivera's arrest received national attention, particularly due to the political discourse surrounding Rivera's immigrant status.
