{"The claim is sourced from a fake news website": "The expert's verdict highlights that the claim originated from a website called TMZWorldNews, which is known for publishing fabricated stories. This raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Lack of credibility of the source": "The expert points out that TMZWorldNews appropriates the name of the popular gossip site TMZ and does not provide any disclaimer about the falsehoods in its content. This further undermines the credibility of the claim.", "Similarity to previous hoax stories": "The expert mentions that the article about Newport developing marijuana cigarettes is almost identical to a previous hoax story about Marlboro selling \"Marlboro M\" cannabis cigarettes. This similarity suggests a pattern of fabrication and casts doubt on the veracity of the claim.", "Inconsistencies in the story": "The expert's verdict mentions that the article includes statements attributed to Reynolds American Inc. Chief Marketing Executive Lawrence Harrison, who supposedly expressed enthusiasm for marketing cannabis. However, there is no evidence or confirmation of such statements from a reliable source, which raises doubts about the accuracy of the information presented in the claim."}
