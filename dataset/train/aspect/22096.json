{"Lack of evidence": "The expert's verdict highlights that there was a lack of evidence to support the claim of a child's skull being found near a sex trafficking site. The initial reports were based on scant evidence, such as the discovery of straps tied to a tree and pornography in an abandoned homeless encampment.", "Police investigation": "The Tucson police conducted an investigation into the claims and found no evidence of criminal activity. They determined that the supposed \"bunker\" was actually an abandoned homeless encampment, further undermining the authenticity of the claim.", "Inaccurate identification": "The skull that was found by the group Veterans on Patrol (VOP) was initially believed to be a child's skull and presented as proof of their claims. However, the Pima County Chief Medical Examiner confirmed that the skull belonged to an adult, contradicting VOP's assertion.", "Inconsistent information": "The expert's verdict mentions that there were inconsistencies in the information provided by VOP, including incorrect coordinates given to law enforcement and conflicting reports about the demolition of the alleged bunker. These inconsistencies raise doubts about the credibility and accuracy of the claim."}
