{"Verification of the location": "The expert's verdict mentions that the first photo of Trump leaning over a person in a hospital bed was taken in the Miami Valley Hospital in Dayton, not El Paso. This verifies that the claim's assertion of the photo being from El Paso is false.", "Identification of the individual in the photo": "The expert's verdict states that the person in the photo is a survivor of the mass shooting in Dayton, not a little girl as suggested by the Facebook post. This verifies that the claim's description of the individual as the daughter of a Trump appointee is false.", "Confirmation from the hospital spokesperson": "The expert's verdict includes a statement from Sharon Howard, a spokesperson for the Miami Valley Hospital, who confirms that all the hospital's patients are adults and that the photos released by the White House are legitimate. This further supports the authenticity of the photos and contradicts the claim's allegation.", "Lack of evidence for crisis actor claims": "The expert's verdict dismisses the conspiracy theory of crisis actors by stating that there is no evidence to suggest that the individual in the photo is a crisis actor. This undermines the claim's suggestion that the photo was staged and verifies the authenticity of the photo."}
