{"The expert analyzed the figures provided by Terry McAuliffe on his campaign website": "which stated that state funding per community college student fell from $4,418 in 2008 to $2,510 in 2012, resulting in a $1,908 drop.", "The expert discovered that McAuliffe": "s calculation included a two-year institution, Richard Bland College, which is not part of the 23-school community college system being referred to in the claim.", "The expert found discrepancies in McAuliffe": "s calculations when comparing them to their own analysis of the data from the State Council on Higher Education for Virginia (SCHEV). McAuliffe's campaign had adjusted some of the data to 2014 dollars, while the expert adjusted all figures to 2012 dollars. As a result, the expert found that the decline in adjusted general fund spending per student was $1,692, slightly lower than McAuliffe's claim of $1,908.", "The expert also pointed out that while budget cuts were a contributing factor to the reduction in funding per student": "it was not the sole reason. State lawmakers had to balance the budget during and after the Great Recession, leading to cuts in all major services supported by the general fund, including education. Appropriations for the community college system for instructional programs decreased from $372.5 million in 2007-08 to $316.2 million in 2011-12. Additionally, the number of students attending community colleges increased during the same period, which impacted the funding per student."}
