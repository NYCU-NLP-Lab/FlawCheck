{"The claim made by Amy McGrath that Mitch McConnell said": "we should just declare bankruptcy\" is partially true. McConnell did mention allowing states to use the bankruptcy route, but he did not explicitly state that states should declare bankruptcy.", "McConnell": "s comments about \"Blue State Bailouts\" were mischaracterized by McGrath. While McConnell did use the term, he did not specifically say that he does not want to pass them, but rather expressed his preference for allowing states to use the bankruptcy route.", "The McConnell campaign issued a response ad claiming that McGrath falsely attacked McConnell": "This suggests that there is a disagreement between the two candidates over the interpretation of McConnell's statements.", "McConnell has not committed to another relief bill for state and local governments": "but he did indicate that Republicans are open to considering another bill. This shows that his stance on providing assistance to states is not set in stone and may be subject to further evaluation."}
