{"Lack of comprehensive national data or study": "Immigration researchers point out that there is no comprehensive national database or study that tracks the number of people killed by undocumented immigrants or the nationality of their victims. This suggests that it is difficult to verify the claim of 1,800 Americans being murdered by illegal aliens in 2017.", "Incomplete information on crimes": "The ICE report cited by McClintock's office includes data on homicide convictions and other offenses by \"arrested aliens.\" However, it is important to note that these crimes did not necessarily take place in 2017 but over a longer period of time. This raises questions about the accuracy of using this data to support the claim.", "Inflated numbers": "Immigration experts, including Alex Nowrasteh from the Cato Institute, argue that the claim of 1,800 murders by illegal immigrants is greatly inflated. They argue that it is highly unlikely that illegal immigrants, who make up about 3.75 percent of the population, would be responsible for 10.4 percent of all murders in the U.S. in 2017.", "Lack of information on immigration status": "FBI crime data, which provides information on homicides in the United States, does not include information on the immigration status of the perpetrators. This further complicates the verification process and makes it difficult to determine the accuracy of the claim."}
