{"The video evidence": "The expert analyzed the video that was shared on social media, which showed a lane where dogs were seen loitering around what appeared to be pieces of meat. The expert examined the video frame-by-frame and observed that the bits and pieces on the lane were actually remains of chickens, such as feathers and bones, not chunks of meat.", "Police investigation": "The Hathras Police conducted an investigation into the incident and tweeted a graphic in response to the claim. They informed that a local municipality official visited the place where the incident allegedly took place and found that the things lying on the ground outside the temple were not pieces of meat but feathers of a chicken and other waste material. The police clarified that the waste was thrown by a shopkeeper in a dustbin near the temple, and street dogs pulled it out and scattered it across the lane.", "Lack of information": "The police statement mentioned that they did not receive any information about Muslims throwing pieces of meat near the Hindu religious place. This indicates that there was no official report or evidence to support the claim.", "Tweet not removed": "Despite the police statement and the clarification provided, the person who made the original claim, Navneet Gautam, did not take down his tweet. This suggests that the claim may not have been thoroughly verified or that the person may have chosen to ignore the contradictory information."}
