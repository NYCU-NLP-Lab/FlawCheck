{"The expert checked Washington": "s most noteworthy speeches, including his two inaugural addresses, to see if there were references to God. The first inaugural address contained references to a deity, such as \"that Almighty Being who rules over the universe,\" while the second inaugural address had no references to God.", "The expert also examined Washington": "s Second Annual Message to Congress, which did not contain any references to God.", "Washington": "s famous speech at Newburgh to officers of the Continental Army also had no references to God, except for an exclamation. This speech was given before he became president.", "It is noted that Washington": "s religious views were not indicative of him being a devout Christian, which challenges the larger point made by Limbaugh that Washington's religious views support the idea of the United States being a Christian nation."}
