{"Discrepancy in job creation numbers": "The expert's verdict highlights the claim made by Assemblyman Robin Schimminger that state officials reported an incorrect number of jobs created by companies participating in Start-Up NY. The expert points out that the report showed more net new jobs for the companies than the number of jobs the companies themselves claimed to have created.", "Possible overcounts in job compilation": "The expert suggests that the overcounting of jobs may have occurred due to companies reporting a two-year amount of net new jobs created (2014 and 2015) and including them in their submission to the agency. The agency then tallied these numbers, resulting in a significant number of overcounts in the compilation of job creation figures.", "Defense of job numbers by Empire State Development Corp": "Howard Zemsky, head of the Empire State Development Corp., defended the job claims made in the Start-Up NY report, stating that he doesn't acknowledge any inaccurate numbers. This statement contradicts Assemblyman Schimminger's claim and adds to the complexity of verifying the authenticity of the job creation figures.", "Lack of clarity in the report and definition of": "net new job': The expert points out that understanding the report requires knowledge of the state's definition of a 'net new job.' The report itself provides little guidance on how to interpret the information, making it challenging to determine the accuracy of the job creation numbers. This lack of clarity adds another aspect to consider when assessing the claim's authenticity."}
