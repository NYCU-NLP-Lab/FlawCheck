{"The Michigan House of Representatives passed a bill that prohibits employers from making microchip implants mandatory for employees and establishes protections for workers who choose not to use the technology": "2. The legislation does not establish a new system to permit or encourage the use of microchips; rather, it establishes new regulations for the technology.", "The bill": "known as the \"Microchip Protection Act,\" establishes guidelines for how businesses can use microchips implanted under people's skin in their workflows.", "The claim that the bill allows employers to microchip workers on a voluntary basis is misleading": "as the bill only prohibits mandatory microchip implants and does not change the existing law that already allows businesses to offer microchips to workers voluntarily."}
