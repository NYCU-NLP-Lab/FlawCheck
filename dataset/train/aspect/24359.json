{"The claim is based on selective TV ratings data": "which only focuses on prime-time viewership and ignores total-day viewership.", "The claim misrepresents the rankings by stating that CNN is not even on the list of the most watched cable networks for 2018": "when in fact CNN ranked No. 11 in prime time and No. 7 for total-day viewership.", "The claim cherry": "picks information by including only the prime-time rankings and omitting the part about CNN's strong No. 7 ranking for total-day viewership.", "The claim has been used in the past to spread misinformation about CNN": "including false claims about the network permanently closing its doors due to a ratings crisis."}
