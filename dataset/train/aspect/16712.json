{"The experiment of adding ice cubes to a glass of water and observing the water level before and after melting is a misleading representation of the impact of climate change on sea level rise": "2. The experiment fails to consider the initial water level in the cup before adding ice, which can significantly affect the water displacement when a large iceberg is added.", "The experiment overlooks the fact that sea water is warmer and more salty than floating ice": "causing changes in the amount of ice to have an effect on global sea levels.", "The expert": "s verdict highlights the loss of mass in Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, which corresponds to a sea-level rise of approximately 1.2 millimeters per year."}
