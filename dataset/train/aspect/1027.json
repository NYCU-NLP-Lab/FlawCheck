{"The claim cites a comment from Thom Tillis that was tracked back to a news release from his campaign": "where he expressed his belief that Obamacare is a threat to the economy and that Republicans should do everything in their power to undo it.", "Patriot Majority": "a pro-Democratic group, claims that Tillis wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which could potentially lead to denial of coverage based on pre-existing conditions.", "Three GOP senators": "including Richard Burr of North Carolina, have proposed a plan that would repeal the ACA but keep the pre-existing conditions protection in place. However, their proposal is not as ironclad as Obamacare in terms of pre-existing conditions coverage.", "The ad also cites a Charlotte Observer article from 2013": "which discusses Tillis' stance on Obamacare and his belief that it will decrease healthcare quality and raise premiums."}
