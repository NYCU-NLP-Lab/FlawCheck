{"Lack of substantive information": "The expert noted that the initial image circulated on social media lacked any substantive information about the claim of a \"pro-ISIS rally\" in Dearborn, Michigan. This raised doubts about its authenticity.", "Confirmation from authorities": "The expert contacted the City of Dearborn's Public Information and Police departments to inquire about the photograph. Officials from these departments confirmed that no such rally had taken place in Dearborn on December 5, 2015, or at any other time. This confirmation from authoritative sources helped verify the claim.", "Reporting by Detroit television station WXYZ": "On the same day as the Facebook post, WXYZ published an article reporting on a peaceful protest against hate and ISIS held in Dearborn. The article included images with similar weather conditions and the presence of multiple flags, none of which were associated with the Islamic State. This evidence indicated that the photograph captured an anti-ISIS demonstration, not a pro-ISIS rally.", "Snopes investigation": "The expert's verdict includes information about Kim LaCapria, a former writer for Snopes, implying that the claim was investigated by Snopes. While the specific details of their investigation are not provided, the mention of Snopes suggests that their expertise and fact-checking process were employed to verify the claim's authenticity."}
