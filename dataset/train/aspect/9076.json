{"Timing and disclosure": "The expert points out that the timing and disclosure of the aid hold in the Ukraine affair differs from the situation with Egypt in 2013. In the case of Ukraine, the hold on aid was not disclosed until weeks after it was made, whereas in Egypt, the suspension of aid was publicly called for by top Democrats and Republicans in Congress.", "Congressional support": "The expert highlights that in the Ukraine affair, Congress had pushed to send the aid, while in the case of Egypt, they were pushing to have it held back. This difference in congressional support indicates a distinct aspect between the two situations.", "Public knowledge": "The expert notes that the hold on Ukraine aid was a closely held decision that many members of the Trump administration were unaware of until weeks after it was made. On the other hand, in the case of Egypt, there were public visits by senators and a public debate surrounding the suspension of aid, indicating a difference in public knowledge and involvement.", "Legal requirements": "The expert mentions that U.S. law requires aid to stop in the event of a coup. In the case of Egypt, the Obama administration was caught between wanting to retain ties to a key regional partner and following the law. This legal requirement sets a distinct aspect between the circumstances of the Ukraine affair and the aid hold in Egypt."}
