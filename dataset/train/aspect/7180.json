{"The image was shared on Instagram by a user named pushpendrakulshresth with a Hindi caption": "suggesting that it was taken during the Bharat bandh. This provides initial evidence of the claim.", "The image was also shared on Twitter by the handle": "ThePushpendraK, again with a Hindi caption alluding to the bandh being called by 'traitors' in the guise of farmers. This indicates that the image was being used to support a particular narrative.", "Many social media users have posted the image with claims of vandalism during the Bharat bandh": "This widespread sharing of the image adds to the perception that the claim is authentic.", "Alt News performed a reverse image search and found a Twitter post from May 2020 where the same image was used": "The tweet by Congress media panelist Surendra Rajput claimed that the photograph was taken during the coronavirus lockdown and incidents of violence against fruit and vegetable vendors were reported. This suggests that the image may not be related to the Bharat bandh as claimed."}
