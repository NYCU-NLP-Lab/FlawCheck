{"Recent data from Johns Hopkins University shows that the U": "S. has had approximately 30 COVID-19 deaths per 100,000 people, which supports the claim made by Joe Kernen.", "However": "while the U.S. is close to 29 deaths per 100,000 people, it is not \"near the low end of per capita deaths\" as stated by Kernen. Only a handful of countries have had more deaths per capita.", "Specifically": "the U.S. had more deaths per 100,000 people at the time of Kernen's comment than all but a handful of European countries, including San Marino, Belgium, Andorra, Spain, the United Kingdom, Italy, France, Sweden, the Netherlands, and Ireland.", "Other reliable sources such as the Kaiser Family Foundation": "Our World in Data, and Worldometer also show similar patterns of higher deaths per capita in the U.S. compared to many other countries."}
