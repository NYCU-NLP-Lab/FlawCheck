{"Lack of national data": "The expert mentions that there is no national source that tracks amniocentesis procedures and their outcomes. This suggests that there is a lack of comprehensive data to support or refute Santorum's claim.", "Input from multiple sources": "The expert reached out to various government agencies, medical associations (such as the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Christian Medical & Dental Associations), and research institutes (like the Guttmacher Institute and the March of Dimes) to gather information. This indicates that the authenticity of the claim was assessed by consulting multiple reputable sources.", "Overstatement by Santorum": "The expert states that there is \"good evidence\" that Santorum overstated his case. This suggests that the claim made by Santorum may not accurately reflect the reality of amniocentesis procedures leading to abortion more often than not in the country.", "Lack of tracking data": "The expert mentions that none of the contacted groups knew of any national source that tracks amniocentesis procedures and their outcomes. This implies that the absence of comprehensive tracking data makes it difficult to definitively verify or refute Santorum's claim."}
