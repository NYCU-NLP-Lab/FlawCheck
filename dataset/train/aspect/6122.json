{"The use of the name": "Beto\" by O'Rourke: The expert verified that O'Rourke had been known as \"Beto\" long before entering political life and provided evidence of his parents referring to him as such from an early age. This contradicted the claim made in the meme that O'Rourke adopted the name solely for political purposes.", "O": "Rourke's family heritage: The expert confirmed through sources such as the New York Times and the El Paso Times that O'Rourke's family is of Irish heritage and that they immigrated from Ireland several generations ago. This contradicted the claim in the meme that O'Rourke was misleading voters by giving the false impression of being Latino.", "Historical references to": "Beto O'Rourke\": The expert found multiple references in the archives of the El Paso Times to \"Beto O'Rourke\" dating back to the 1980s and early 2000s when O'Rourke was either a child or a businessman. This provided evidence that O'Rourke had been using the name \"Beto\" well before his political career, contradicting the claim in the meme that it was a tactic for appealing to Latino voters.", "Campaign response and news reports": "The expert mentioned that O'Rourke's campaign spokesperson described the meme as factually incorrect and referred to existing news reports about the allegations. While not explicitly stated, it can be inferred that the expert reviewed these news reports to further verify the authenticity of the claim. This suggests that the expert considered the campaign's response and external news sources as additional aspects to verify the claim."}
