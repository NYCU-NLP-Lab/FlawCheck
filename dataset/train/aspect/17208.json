{"The expert checked the accuracy of the claim by comparing it to the official records of NJ Transit fare increases": "They found that the claim was incorrect in stating that the fare increases occurred in May of this year, when in fact they happened in May 2010.", "The expert also noted that the claim inaccurately stated that the fare increases ranged from 25 percent to 47 percent": "They found that while rail fares did increase by 25 percent, the average increase for buses and light rail trains was 10 percent, not the higher range stated in the claim.", "The expert interviewed Albert Papp Jr": "the president of the New Jersey Association of Railroad Passengers, to understand the context and intention behind his statement. Papp clarified that he considered any fare increase to be a tax increase, and that he believed there had been a tax increase for NJ Transit riders.", "The expert acknowledged that Papp": "s statement was a mistake in terms of the timing and specific figures of the fare increases, but they also highlighted the underlying concern raised by Papp about the impact of fare increases on mass transit riders and the need for social equity."}
