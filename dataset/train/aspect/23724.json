{"The claim is based on a photo of a cow wearing an inflatable pink cylinder on its back": "which is misleadingly presented as a recent occurrence when it actually dates back to a research project in Argentina in 2008.", "The purpose of the inflatable backpack worn by the cow was not to capture farts": "as claimed in the post, but to collect gas produced during the cow's digestive process for scientific study. The backpack was connected to the cow's stomach through a hole in its ribs and collected what would have been burps, not farts.", "The research project aimed to study the effect of the cow": "s diet on the production of methane and other volatile organic compounds, which contribute to climate change. The researchers used a similar gas collection system in previous studies and found that dietary additives could decrease methane production.", "The claim misrepresents the intentions of the researchers and the purpose of the cow": "s backpack. The backpack was not designed to keep methane out of the atmosphere but to aid in scientific research on cow digestion. The claim also fails to acknowledge the significant contribution of human activities, including livestock, to methane emissions and their impact on climate change."}
