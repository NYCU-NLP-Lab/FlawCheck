{"Lack of evidence": "The expert found no evidence in internet searches or archived news databases to support the claim that women used to apologize to their husbands and beg for forgiveness during the Christmas season.", "Image origins": "The image in question has been shared online for years with different explanations attached to it. A reverse-image search revealed that it was widely circulated in 2014 with captions that simply said \"women begging men,\" without any mention of Christmas or forgiveness.", "Russian connection": "The image has also been shared on many Russian-language websites, with one caption translating to \"Etiquette a century ago. Ladies invite gentlemen to the White Dance, 1900.\" This suggests that the image may be related to a Russian cultural event rather than a Christmas tradition of apology and forgiveness.", "Expert opinion": "Jim Leary, an emeritus professor of folklore, stated that he has never encountered evidence of a seasonal tradition like the one described in the Facebook post. He called the claim \"ridiculous\" and more like a \"patriarchal fantasy\" than something based in reality."}
