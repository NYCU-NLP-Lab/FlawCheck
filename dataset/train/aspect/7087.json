{"The expert": "s verdict includes a direct quote from Hillary Clinton where she claims that not a single Republican candidate, announced or potential, is clearly and consistently supporting a path to citizenship.", "The expert highlights that Clinton specifically refers to Republican candidates who have": "clearly and consistently\" articulated support for a path to citizenship, discounting those who may have previously supported it but have since stopped or made statements that undermine their commitment.", "The expert provides an example of a Republican candidate": "Lindsey Graham, who has unambiguously supported a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants, including specific requirements such as registering with the government, paying fines, learning English, and undergoing background checks.", "The expert mentions other Republican candidates": "such as Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, Carly Fiorina, Rick Perry, and Rick Santorum, who either have never explicitly expressed support for a path to citizenship or have ambiguous views on the matter. Additionally, the expert mentions candidates like Scott Walker, Chris Christie, and Ben Carson, who have expressed support for a path to citizenship in the past but have since reversed themselves or given unclear responses."}
