{"The claim was based on a page on WhiteHouse": "org that used the word \"citizens\" instead of \"persons\" to summarize the United States Constitution.", "The wording using": "citizens\" instead of \"persons\" has been in use since at least the Obama administration and does not affect the actual wording of the United States Constitution.", "The claim originated from a rumor circulating on social media that President Donald Trump had rewritten the United States Constitution": "changing the words \"people\" or \"persons\" to \"citizens.\"", "Two images were presented as evidence of the change": "one showing the text on WhiteHouse.gov and the other showing the text on ConstitutionUS.com. However, the text on WhiteHouse.gov was not a reproduction of the Bill of Rights but a summary, and the language used was informal to explain the purpose of each amendment, not a direct substitution of \"person\" with \"citizen.\""}
