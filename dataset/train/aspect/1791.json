{"Lack of evidence of BJP MP Ashok Saxena": "The expert found that there is no BJP MP in the Lok Sabha by the name of Ashok Saxena, which casts doubt on the claim that he made the statement about the Sun God getting angry if people use solar energy.", "Source of the claim": "The claim was posted in the official Facebook group of Aam Aadmi Party, a political party in India. This raises questions about the credibility and potential bias of the source.", "Multiple versions of the video": "The expert discovered that the video of the solar panels being vandalized has been circulating on social media for some time, with different claims about who is responsible for the vandalism. This suggests that the video may have been repurposed or manipulated to fit different narratives.", "Context of the incident": "The expert found information from Climate Samurai, a website that reports on environmental issues, confirming that the incident of solar panel vandalism took place in Maharashtra in February 2018. The workers involved in the vandalism were protesting against non-payment of wages, which indicates a different motive than the claim made in the viral post."}
