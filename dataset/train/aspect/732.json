{"The claim is based on a May 2014 study by the Brookings Institution titled": "Declining Business Dynamism in the United States: A Look at States and Metros.\" This study examined business creation and destruction in the U.S. since 1978 and found that starting in 2008, the number of business failures exceeded the number of business entries for the first time in their 35-year history of data.", "The study": "s authors noted that this trend of more businesses closing than opening fits into a larger narrative of business consolidation occurring in the U.S. economy. They did not provide specific reasons for this trend, but highlighted that older and larger businesses are doing better relative to younger and smaller ones.", "The claim is supported by a May 2014 story from the Washington Post": "s Wonkblog, which reported on the Brookings Institution study. The story also mentioned that business failures had held steady over most of the period examined, while business entries had steadily declined.", "However": "it is important to note that the data used in the study and the claim only covers the period from 1976 to 2012, and the claim does not consider the entire 239-year history of the United States. Economists mentioned that there may be other measures or data before 1976, but they are not systematically measured year in and year out. Therefore, determining the authenticity of the claim for the entire history of the United States is difficult."}
