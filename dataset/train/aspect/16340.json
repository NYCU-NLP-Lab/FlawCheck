{"The source of the claim": "The expert examined the source of the claim, which was a news release published by Rep. Vicky Hartzler. The expert verified that the claim was made by Hartzler in the release.", "The supporting evidence": "The expert analyzed the Eighth Broadband Progress Report compiled by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and released in 2012. This report was provided by Hartzler's spokesman and was included in the news release. The expert confirmed that the report supported Hartzler's claim that roughly one-fourth of rural Missourians lack access to high-speed internet.", "Inaccuracy in the claim": "The expert identified an inaccuracy in Hartzler's claim made in a tweet. The expert compared the tweet's claim of one-fifth of all Missourians lacking access to high-speed internet with the data from the 2012 FCC report, which stated that 7.5 percent of the total state population lacked access. The expert concluded that Hartzler's tweet was inaccurate based on this discrepancy.", "Outdated benchmark speed": "The expert noted that the 2012 FCC report used an outdated benchmark internet speed of 4mbps/1mbps. The expert compared this with the benchmark speed of 25mbps/3mbps used in the 2016 FCC Broadband Progress Report. This highlighted the need for an updated assessment of high-speed internet access in Missouri and suggested that the problem might be even more significant than indicated by the 2012 report."}
