{"Reverse image search": "The authenticity of the claim was verified by conducting a reverse search of the image, which revealed that it had been photoshopped. The original image showed Mahatma Gandhi with former Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru.", "Archive verification": "The image was found in the archives of Associated Press, which confirmed that it was taken at an All-India Congress committee meeting in Bombay, India, on July 6, 1946. This verification helped establish the true context of the image.", "Juxtaposition analysis": "A comparison between the photoshopped image shared on social media and the original image uploaded by AP clearly demonstrated that the former was a result of photoshop manipulation. This analysis further reinforced the inauthenticity of the claim.", "Historical debunking": "The image had been circulating on social media for several years, with Alt News debunking it in 2018 as well. This historical debunking, along with the evidence of the image being used in unrelated contexts such as a video about Gandhi's sex life, added to the credibility of the expert's verdict."}
