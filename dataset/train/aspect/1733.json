{"The claim is based on data from the Congressional Budget Office": "CBO), which is the official scorekeeper for Congress. The CBO's most recent estimates, published in August 2010, indicate that the federal deficit in 2010 will exceed $1.3 trillion, which aligns with the claim.", "The claim compares the deficit": "to-GDP ratio of 9.1 percent in 2010 with historical data going back to 1930. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB), a government agency that helps prepare the president's annual budget, confirms that in previous years, only in 2009 and during the war years of 1942-1945 was the deficit-to-GDP ratio higher than 9.1 percent. This supports the claim that 2010 is on track to be the second-largest budget deficit in 65 years.", "The OMB projected in July that the 2010 deficit would be 10": "6 percent of GDP, which would make it the biggest in 65 years, contradicting the claim. However, the expert notes that the discrepancy arises from differences in projections of future economic conditions and the impact of legislation enacted after the OMB completed its estimates. Therefore, the more recent estimate from the CBO, which aligns with the claim, is considered more reliable.", "The expert": "s verdict emphasizes their commitment to publishing the truth and providing accurate information to inform democratic participation. This implies that the claim has been thoroughly fact-checked and verified using reliable sources such as the CBO and the OMB."}
