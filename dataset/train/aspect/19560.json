{"The expert noted that the claim made by Marco Rubio was in response to a question asked by CNBC moderator Becky Quick during the Republican presidential debate in Boulder": "Colorado on October 28, 2015. This provides a specific context for the claim.", "The expert highlighted that Quick": "s question to Rubio was about his financial skills and qualifications to guide national fiscal policy, and she mentioned specific examples of Rubio's financial troubles, such as intermingling campaign money with personal funds, facing foreclosure on a second home, and liquidating a retirement fund. These specific examples add credibility to Quick's question and support the authenticity of the claim.", "The expert pointed out that Rubio": "s response to the question was to dismiss it as \"discredited attacks from Democrats and my political opponents.\" This suggests that Rubio's claim of discredited attacks implies that the specific examples mentioned by Quick were not true or accurate. This aspect adds to the verification process by questioning the credibility of the examples provided.", "The expert also mentioned that Rubio had previously created political committees to pay for travel and other expenses": "spending over $100,000 between 2006 and 2008. The Florida Commission on Ethics dismissed a citizen complaint filed during Rubio's Senate campaign in 2010. This information further supports the authenticity of Quick's examples and undermines Rubio's claim of discredited attacks."}
