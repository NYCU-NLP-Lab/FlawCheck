{"The number of Palestinian children killed in the last three weeks": "The expert's verdict mentions that the United Nation's figures, which have been widely reported by major news organizations, state that there have been at least 229 child deaths in Gaza during this period. This verifies the claim that more than 200 Palestinian children have been killed.", "The UN": "s tally of total deaths, civilian deaths, and child deaths: The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs provides daily reports on the humanitarian situation in Gaza, including the number of deaths. The expert's verdict refers to the UN's July 31 report, which states that the total Palestinian death toll is 1,263, with at least 852 civilians and 249 children. This further supports the claim.", "Attribution of deaths to Israel": "The expert's verdict acknowledges that there is an ongoing debate about attributing all the deaths directly to Israel. Palestinian and Israeli officials have blamed each other's bombs for some of the civilian deaths. However, the UN has been working to resolve conflicting claims and has traced some deaths back to Israel. This aspect highlights the complexity of determining the exact responsibility for the deaths.", "Israeli government": "s figures on casualties: The expert's verdict mentions that the CNN host, Jake Tapper, looked at the Israeli government's figures on casualties for their four major military operations since 2006. While the specific details of these figures are not provided, it suggests that Tapper considered the historical context and compared the number of Israeli soldiers killed in those operations to the number of Palestinian children killed in the last three weeks. This aspect adds another layer of verification to the claim."}
