{"The rumor originated from a conspiratorial website": "Infowars, which accused CNN of deleting a specific episode of \"Larry King Live\" from Google Play.", "The rumor was based on an incorrect assumption made from a single screenshot posted on Twitter": "which showed a missing episode from the Google Play store.", "The screenshot is genuine": "and it is true that the episode in question is not listed on Google Play. However, this does not indicate that CNN removed the episode.", "Google Play lists episodes that are not available for viewing": "and it does not provide episode descriptions. Therefore, even if the episode had been listed, it would not have mentioned Tara Reade, giving CNN little incentive to remove it."}
