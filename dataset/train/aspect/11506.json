{"Hillary Clinton": "s tax plan includes a 4 percent surcharge on income earned in excess of $5 million and a minimum tax rate of 30 percent for those earning more than $1 million.", "Clinton proposes to limit certain exemptions and deductions to 28 percent": "tax carried interest as ordinary income, and permanently reduce the tax threshold for estates to $3.5 million, or $7 million for married couples, while increasing the top estate tax rate to 45 percent.", "Independent experts": "such as the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, have concluded that Clinton's tax plan would raise taxes on the top 1 percent of income earners by more than $78,000, while taxpayers in the bottom 95 percent would see little change in average after-tax income.", "Trump": "s claim that Clinton's plan would \"double your taxes\" is not supported by expert analysis. The Tax Foundation, which generally favors lower taxes, also found that Clinton's plan would raise taxes on the top 20 percent of taxpayers but cut taxes for taxpayers in all other income quintiles."}
