{"Comparison of average pay and benefits": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim is based on an August 13, 2010 USA Today article, which used Bureau of Economic Analysis data to compare the average pay and benefits of federal civil servants and private sector workers. This aspect involves analyzing the data provided by the article to determine if federal workers indeed make twice as much as private sector workers when considering both pay and benefits.", "Different mix of jobs performed": "The expert's verdict highlights that the USA Today statistics do not account for the different mix of jobs performed by federal and private sector employees. This aspect involves considering the types of jobs and industries in which federal workers and private sector workers are employed, as this can impact the average compensation levels.", "Inclusion of benefits in the comparison": "The expert's verdict points out that the statistic cited by USA Today includes benefits, which tend to be higher for federal employees. This aspect involves examining whether the claim accurately reflects the wages alone or if it includes the additional value of benefits provided to federal workers.", "Stripping out benefits to compare salaries": "The expert's verdict mentions that when benefits are stripped out, federal employees earned an average salary of $81,258 compared to $50,464 for private sector employees. This aspect involves considering the difference in salary alone between federal workers and private sector workers, without factoring in benefits, to determine the accuracy of the claim."}
