{"Lack of evidence for the existence of the Young Christian Forum and Reverend Damut": "The expert's verdict mentions that there is no evidence or online record of either the Youth Christian Forum or Reverend Damut before the claims were made. This raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Inconsistency in the sources reporting the claim": "The claim appeared on websites like Newsproof.org, Signal NG, The Nigerian Tribune, and Global Village Extra. However, these websites had not previously reported on the event but only carried reactions to the alleged treaty signing. This inconsistency suggests a lack of credibility.", "Absence of any record of the treaty signing": "Despite the claim stating that the treaty was signed in Dubai, away from Nigeria, there is no evidence or record of such a treaty being signed. This lack of concrete evidence undermines the credibility of the claim.", "Denial from Abubakar": "s campaign spokesperson: Sola Sanni, a spokesperson for Abubakar's campaign, explicitly denies that Abubakar has signed any treaty with any country and mentions that he has not mentioned LGBT rights in his campaign. This denial from an official representative adds to the doubts surrounding the claim's authenticity."}
