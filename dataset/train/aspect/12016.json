{"The video was first shared on 16 September 2017 with a description stating that it was taken during the Utah State Fair": "which coincides with reports from Utah news stations about strange lights in the sky. This suggests that the video was not filmed in Oklahoma City as claimed.", "The footage shown in the viral video can also be seen in another video that compiled several clips of the same": "UFOs\" in Utah, not Oklahoma City. This indicates that the video does not provide evidence of unidentified flying objects over Oklahoma City.", "At the same time the videos were taken": "Navy paratroopers were dropping into Rice-Eccles Stadium for a football game in Utah. A video captured from inside the stadium shows the paratroopers using flares, which could explain the streaking lights seen in the viral video. This suggests that the lights were actually the paratroopers in free fall with flares.", "The proximity of the Utah State Fair to Rice": "Eccles Stadium further supports the conclusion that the lights in the video were the paratroopers and their flares. The fair was held just a few miles away, making it likely that the viral video captured the paratroopers' activity rather than unidentified flying objects."}
