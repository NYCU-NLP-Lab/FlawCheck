{"The claim made by President Trump that he": "authorized Zero access to White House (actually turned him down many times) for author of phony book\" is disputed by the expert's verdict. The expert points out that the public record shows that Trump's statement is inaccurate, as the author of the book, Michael Wolff, had more than a dozen interactions with administration officials at the White House.", "The expert": "s verdict includes a quote from Wolff's account of his access to the White House, where he explains that Trump never explicitly allowed or barred his visits. This allowed Wolff to exploit the \"non-disapproval\" and gain access through various senior staffers. This aspect suggests that Trump's claim of denying access to the author is not entirely accurate."}
