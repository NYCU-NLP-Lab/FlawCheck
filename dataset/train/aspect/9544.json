{"Lack of credible evidence": "The expert points out that the \"researchers\" in the Discovery Channel episode did not provide any hard evidence of a living megalodon. They only claimed to have tagged something that escaped without getting a good look at it. This lack of substantial evidence undermines the authenticity of the claim.", "Absence of media coverage": "The expert highlights that if a megalodon had indeed capsized a charter vessel off the coast of South Africa in April 2013, it would have been a significant event. However, the South African press did not report on such an incident, suggesting that it may not have occurred at all.", "Lack of scientific controversy": "The expert quotes a post-doctoral researcher from the University of Miami's Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science, who states that the possibility of megalodons still existing is not a subject of genuine inquiry or controversy among legitimate scientists. This indicates that the claim lacks support from the scientific community.", "Comparison to mythical creatures": "The expert compares the controversy surrounding the existence of megalodons to that of mermaids, implying that the claim is on par with mythical creatures. By associating the claim with something widely regarded as fictional, the expert suggests that it lacks credibility."}
