{"Multiple sources and variations of the claim": "The expert noted that the claim was spread through various sources, including Facebook and Twitter postings, and appeared multiple times over the years. This suggests that the claim had gained traction and was widely shared.", "Lack of specific details": "The expert mentioned that the postings did not include the name of the injured toddler, and each message identified the child's mother with a different name. This inconsistency raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim and suggests that it may be a fabricated story.", "Urgency and emotional appeal": "The expert pointed out that the claim used urgent language and emotional appeals, such as \"URGENT PRAYER REQUEST\" and \"please start a prayer chain.\" These tactics are often employed to evoke sympathy and encourage people to share the message without critically evaluating its authenticity.", "Limited verifiable information": "Despite attempts to verify the existence of the injured child, the expert stated that they were unable to find any concrete evidence. The lack of verifiable information or additional details about the incident raises suspicions about the claim's authenticity."}
