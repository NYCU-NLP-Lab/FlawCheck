{"The source of the claim": "The expert examined the source of the claim, which was a video shared by Alexandre Krauss, a senior political advisor in the European parliament. The expert verified that Krauss had tweeted the video and that it had also been shared by another Twitter handle, @clarkkent04211.", "Reverse": "image search: The expert conducted a reverse-image search of a keyframe from the video and found that it had been uploaded on YouTube on March 27, 2020. The video was originally from TikTok, as indicated by the TikTok username 'binhan728' in the top left corner of the video. This helped establish that the video was not recent and therefore could not represent a recent incident related to the India-China border dispute.", "Comparison with other videos": "The expert found similar videos shot in Myanmar's Jade mines, where people were rushing to find gemstones. This suggested that the video in question may have been taken in Myanmar and not along the India-China border.", "Lack of media reporting": "The expert noted that if such an incident of Indians rushing to block illegal Chinese construction had taken place, it would have been reported in the media. The fact that there was no media reporting further cast doubt on the authenticity of the claim."}
