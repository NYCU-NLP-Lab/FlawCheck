{"The claim is based on a photograph": "One aspect employed to verify the authenticity of the claim is the examination of the photograph itself. Experts may analyze the image for any signs of manipulation or editing that could cast doubt on its authenticity.", "Radiation levels near the daisies": "The expert's verdict mentions that the radiation level near the daisies in the photograph was measured at \"0.5 \u03bcSv/h at 1m above the ground.\" This aspect involves verifying the accuracy of this measurement and determining if it is consistent with the effects of radiation on plant life.", "Comparison with similar mutations in non": "radiation affected areas: The expert's verdict highlights that similar mutations have been found in locations far away from nuclear radiation. This aspect involves examining other instances of mutated daisies and determining if they share the same characteristics as the ones in the photograph, indicating that the mutations may not be solely caused by radiation.", "Identification of fasciation as a potential cause": "The expert's verdict suggests that the appearance of mutated daisies near the Fukushima plant could be the result of fasciation, a rare condition affecting plants. This aspect involves studying the characteristics of fasciation and comparing them to the mutations seen in the photograph to determine if they align, providing an alternative explanation for the observed mutations."}
