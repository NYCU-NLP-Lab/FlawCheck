{"Video and photographic evidence": "The authenticity of the claim was verified through the analysis of video and photographic evidence taken at the Red Fort during the protest. These visuals showed a protester climbing a flagpole below the Indian flag and hoisting a smaller triangular flag, while the tricolor flag remained on a different pole at a higher spot throughout the protest.", "Multiple media outlets": "The claim was further verified by multiple media outlets that captured video and photographs of the protest at the Red Fort. These outlets provided additional evidence that the national tricolor flag was not torn down, as claimed, but remained on a separate pole.", "Getty Images photographs": "Getty Images photographs from the same day were examined to support the authenticity of the claim. These photographs showed a triangular saffron flag alongside another rectangular yellow flag on the same pole, which were identified as the flags commonly seen during the months-long demonstrations and carried Sikh religious iconography.", "Comparison with Khalistan flags": "The flags hoisted at the Red Fort were compared to flags associated with the Khalistan separatist movement. It was found that the flags at the Red Fort did not match the flags typically carried by members of the Khalistan movement, which have the symbol of the Nishan Sahib with \"Khalistan\" written on them. The flags at the Red Fort were identified as the Nishan Sahib flags commonly seen at Sikh temples and during India's Republic Day festivities."}
