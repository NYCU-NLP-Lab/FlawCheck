{"The claim is not based on a photograph of Harriet Tubman": "but rather a photo of Mary Fields, known as \"Stagecoach Mary,\" who worked as the first African-American woman mail carrier in the late 1800s.", "Harriet Tubman": "s biographer and historian, Kate Clifford Larson, confirms that Tubman was not a \"gun-toting, 2nd Amendment-supporting Republican who shot Democrats.\" Tubman's anti-slavery efforts aligned with the Republican party's ideals, but she was not allowed to vote and did not officially join any political party.", "Tubman": "s political beliefs were more in line with Susan B. Anthony, a Democrat, who Tubman admired and followed. Anthony became a Democrat after feeling betrayed by the Republican Party for not granting women the right to vote when they passed the 15th Amendment.", "While Tubman did carry a long gun during her time as a spy in the Civil War": "it was to fight Confederates, not Democrats. She primarily carried a pistol to protect herself from slave-catchers."}
