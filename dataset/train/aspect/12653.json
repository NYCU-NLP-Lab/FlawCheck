{"The image is a modern day creation": "The expert's verdict states that the image in question is not a decades-old mural, but rather a modern artwork reflecting the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. This aspect verifies that the claim is not authentic in terms of being a prediction from 1994.", "Attribution to CJ Trinidad": "Although the expert couldn't definitively link an artist to the work, it is mentioned that CJ Trinidad appears to be the creator of the artwork. The earliest posting of the image was found on Trinidad's Facebook page, and there are other similar artworks attributed to him. This aspect provides some evidence towards the authenticity of the claim.", "Collaboration with Filipino educators": "The expert mentions that a community of Filipino educators partnered with CJ Trinidad to raise money for teachers affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. They credited Trinidad as the artist behind \"Maskcommunication.\" This collaboration and endorsement by the Filipino Teachers (TFT) adds credibility to the claim.", "Alternate attribution to Neha Kumari": "The expert notes that the painting was credited to someone named Neha Kumari when it was submitted to an international art competition. This aspect introduces some confusion and raises questions about the authenticity of the claim, as it suggests that there might be multiple artists or conflicting information about the authorship of the artwork."}
