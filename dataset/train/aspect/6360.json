{"The claim states that Jim Sensenbrenner": "has been in office for 40 years\" and \"he's led on exactly one bill,\" the Patriot Act.", "The expert": "s verdict also mentions that Sensenbrenner has served in the House since 1979, which aligns with the claim of him being in office for 40 years.", "The state Republican Party responded to the claim by citing Congress": "gov data, which shows that Sensenbrenner was the lead sponsor on 500 bills or amendments, 99 of which passed the House and 34 became law. This contradicts the claim that he has only led on one bill."}
