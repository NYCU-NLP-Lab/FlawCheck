{"Lack of corroborating evidence": "The expert found no evidence to support the claim that Theresa May and Dalia Grybauskait\u0117 were photographed with Angela Merkel as teenagers. Despite reaching out to the individuals involved, no replies were received.", "Absence of identification in the photo": "The available evidence suggests that it is unlikely for two public figures like May and Grybauskait\u0117 to not be identified in the photo alongside Merkel if they were indeed present. This points away from the claim made in the Facebook post.", "Dissimilarities in appearance": "Photos of May from around the time the alleged photo was taken do not resemble the person pictured next to Merkel. This further undermines the authenticity of the claim.", "Different educational backgrounds": "The three women did not attend the same schools or universities. Merkel attended high school in Templin, Germany, and then enrolled at the University of Leipzig. May was mainly educated at Wheatley Park Comprehensive School in England before going to Oxford University. Grybauskait\u0117 attended Vilnius Salomeja Neris Secondary School in Lithuania before studying at Leningrad University in Russia. This divergence in educational paths casts doubt on the claim that they were close friends as teenagers."}
