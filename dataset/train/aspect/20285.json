{"The expert clarifies that any Air Force plane carrying the president is technically Air Force One": "debunking the claim that Biden's plane is not the same as Trump's Air Force One.", "The expert explains that there are two types of planes typically designated for carrying the president": "a Boeing VC-25A and a Boeing C-32. The VC-25A is the iconic military plane most commonly associated with Air Force One, while the C-32 is typically used for shorter domestic flights and flights to small airports that can't support the much larger VC-25A. This information contradicts the claim that Biden's plane is not the real Air Force One.", "The expert provides evidence that Joe Biden is the president of the United States": "stating that he boarded Air Force One on February 5th and flew to his home state of Delaware. This directly refutes the claim that Biden is not the real president.", "The expert highlights that the theory claiming Biden is not flying on Air Force One because he is not the real commander": "in-chief is baseless and not supported by facts. This further discredits the claim made in the video and Facebook post."}
