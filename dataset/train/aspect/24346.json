{"Former Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang announced his intention to move to Georgia to help elect Democrats in the runoff election and encouraged others to go there to organize and campaign": "2. New York Times columnist Tom Friedman expressed his hope that everyone would move to Georgia and vote for the two Democratic senators.", "The claim falsely suggests that Yang and Friedman advocated for": "temporarily\" moving to Georgia or establishing \"fake residency\" to vote in the runoff election, when they only mentioned moving to the state and becoming legal residents.", "The State of Georgia has weak residency rules for voting eligibility": "and there have been leftist individuals urging fellow Democrats to set up fake residence in Georgia to help Democrats win the Senate runoff elections. However, this does not directly link to the statements made by Yang and Friedman."}
