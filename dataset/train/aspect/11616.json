{"The examination results": "The expert analyzed the data from the UPSC website and found that the percentage of Muslim candidates qualifying for the exam varied between 3% to 5% over the last five years. This data contradicts the claim that Muslims are favored in the exam.", "Recruitment numbers": "The expert noted that the number of Muslim qualifiers in the UPSC exam is not constant every year. In 2017, the percentage of Muslim candidates qualifying was a little over 5%, while in 2018, the number decreased. This indicates that there is no consistent pattern of Muslim candidates being favored.", "Misinformation and conspiracy theories": "The expert highlighted that the Sudarshan News show used misinformation to legitimize dangerous conspiracy theories. The show attempted to portray Muslim aspirants as being favored by the government at the expense of Hindu candidates, but there was no substantial evidence to support this claim.", "Age limit discrepancy": "Sudarshan News claimed that the age limit for Hindu candidates is 32, while for OBC Muslims, it is 35. However, the expert pointed out that a notification issued by the Union Public Service Commission stated that the lower age limit for all categories, including OBC Muslims, is the same at 32. This discrepancy in the channel's claim further undermines its credibility."}
