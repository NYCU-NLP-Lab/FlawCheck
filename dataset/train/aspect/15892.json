{"The video includes a voiceover stating that the Commission on Audit": "COA) found that funds from the Office of the Vice President were not distributed to intended beneficiaries and that Leni Robredo could not explain why the funds were not released to Filipinos. This suggests that there is an allegation of mishandling of funds.", "The video shows screenshots of a news headline and the first six paragraphs of a report from the Philippine Daily Inquirer": "The headline states that the COA flagged the Office of the Vice President for its slow use of medical aid funds, and Robredo points to an election ban as the reason for the delay. This indicates that there is an official audit report raising concerns about the use of funds.", "The video has been shared on various platforms": "including YouTube, blogs, and Facebook. This suggests that the claim has gained some attention and is being circulated online.", "However": "the expert's verdict clarifies that the video is misleading because it leaves out parts of the Inquirer report that mention Robredo's explanation, which has been accepted by the COA. The news report and the actual audit documents do not mention anything about filing charges against Robredo's office. This indicates that the claim of charging Robredo over \"unexplained\" funds is not supported by the evidence presented."}
