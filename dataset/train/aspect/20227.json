{"Governor Rick Scott": "s claim of cutting taxes 75 times and reducing taxes by $7.5 billion was verified by a list of 82 \"tax cuts\" provided by Scott's team, which reduced government revenues by a combined $7.7 billion.", "The tax cuts implemented by Scott were organized into four broad categories": "targeted breaks (21 items), sales tax reductions or exemptions (25), breaks for businesses (17), and fee reductions (12).", "The largest portion of the tax cuts were focused on reducing the amount of taxes collected on specific goods": "services, or industries, aiming to build a more competitive business climate, such as the permanent sales tax exemption for manufacturing equipment.", "While the tax cuts may have contributed to positive economic growth": "experts state that it is difficult to directly attribute the creation of 1.3 million jobs to the tax cuts. Other driving factors and variables play a significant role in job growth."}
