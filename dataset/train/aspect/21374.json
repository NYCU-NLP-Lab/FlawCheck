{"The expert": "s verdict is based on the statement made by House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, who claims that the 2009 stimulus bill \"failed to get people back to work.\" This claim serves as the primary aspect employed to verify the authenticity of the statement.", "The expert analyzes the justification provided by Cantor": "s spokesperson, Megan Whittemore, who argues that the unemployment rate is higher now than when the stimulus bill was passed, there are more discouraged workers, and private sector growth in May was slower than expected. These economic statistics are used as supporting evidence to evaluate the claim.", "The expert notes that Cantor": "s statement lacks specificity regarding the types of jobs he is referring to, whether public or private. This lack of clarity raises the question of whether the stimulus bill was successful in creating jobs in either sector, adding another aspect to consider in assessing the claim.", "The expert consults the White House": "s stimulus website, which provides data on jobs funded by the stimulus bill. The website states that between February 17, 2009, and March 31, 2011, the U.S. had a reported 573,510 full-time equivalent jobs funded by stimulus fund contracts, grants, and loans. The expert uses this information as additional evidence to evaluate the claim's authenticity."}
