{"Multiple news sources have reported on the claim": "The expert's verdict mentions various news sources such as AP, NBC News, Vanity Fair, The New York Post, and a Fox News affiliate that have reported on the claim of Joe Exotic testing positive for coronavirus in prison. This suggests that the claim has received attention from reputable media outlets.", "Contradictory statements from different sources": "The expert's verdict highlights conflicting information regarding Joe Exotic's COVID-19 status. While some sources claim he has tested positive and has been moved to a prison hospital for treatment, others state that he is in self-isolation due to other inmates testing positive and that he does not have the disease. These contradictory statements raise doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Lack of concrete evidence or official confirmation": "The expert's verdict mentions that initial reports from British tabloids and a Facebook post from Joe Exotic himself have suggested that he does not have COVID-19. However, there is no concrete evidence or official confirmation from reliable sources to support or refute the claim. This lack of concrete evidence makes it difficult to verify the authenticity of the claim.", "Flagged as false news by Facebook": "The expert's verdict mentions that the blog post making the claim was flagged by Facebook as part of their efforts to combat false news and misinformation on their platform. This indicates that Facebook has found the claim to be potentially false or misleading. While this alone does not prove the claim to be untrue, it raises further doubts about its authenticity."}
