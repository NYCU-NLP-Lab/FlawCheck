{"Beto O": "Rourke's claim that he is not talking about confiscating anybody's guns is contradicted by his own statements and responses to questions. He has expressed support for a mandatory buyback program for assault-style weapons like AR-15s and AK-47s.", "O": "Rourke has been asked multiple times about his support for gun confiscation and has responded affirmatively. He has stated that he is in favor of confiscating AR-15s and AK-47s, but not firearms used for hunting or self-defense.", "The El Paso and Dayton mass shootings": "which O'Rourke references, involved the use of assault-style weapons. These weapons are legal in both states and can fire as quickly as the trigger is pulled, potentially causing significant harm and casualties."}
