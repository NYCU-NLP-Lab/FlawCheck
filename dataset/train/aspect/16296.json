{"The claim is based on a letter written by three Republican members of Congress": "namely Rep. Ginny Brown-Waite, Rep. Cliff Stearns, and Rep. Ron Paul, urging President Barack Obama to obtain Congress' consent before accepting the Nobel Prize.", "The members reference Article 1": "Section 9 of the Constitution, which states that no person holding any office of profit or trust under the United States shall accept any present, emolument, office, or title from any foreign state without the consent of Congress.", "The letter argues that since the Nobel Peace Prize is awarded by a committee appointed by the Norwegian Parliament": "the Storting, it falls under the requirements set forth in Article 1, Section 9 of the Constitution.", "The letter also cites the precedent set by President Theodore Roosevelt": "who obtained Congress' consent to send his Nobel Prize money to various charities after creating a committee to hold the funds. This supports the claim that obtaining permission from Congress to accept the prize should be straightforward."}
