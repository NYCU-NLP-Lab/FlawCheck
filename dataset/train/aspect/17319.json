{"Testimony from Lisa Moore": "Lisa Moore, a University of Texas English professor, provided firsthand accounts of faculty members declining job offers and students changing their minds about attending the university due to the campus carry policy. Her testimony provides a direct link between the policy and the claimed impact on job applicants, prospective students, and invited speakers.", "University of Texas President": "s concerns: UT-Austin President Gregory L. Fenves expressed his concerns about how the campus carry law would affect the recruitment and retention of faculty members and students. His statement acknowledges the potential impact of the policy on the university community, further supporting the authenticity of the claim.", "Lawsuit filed by professors": "Lisa Moore and two fellow professors filed a lawsuit seeking to bar civilian handguns from campus. The fact that they took legal action to challenge the policy suggests that they genuinely believe it has had a negative impact on job applicants, prospective students, and invited speakers.", "Federal judge": "s denial of preliminary injunction: A federal judge denied the request for a preliminary injunction that would have allowed the professors to ban concealed handguns from their classrooms. The judge's decision indicates that there was a legal case made regarding the impact of the policy on academic freedom and the judge did not find sufficient grounds to grant the injunction. This adds credibility to the claim that the policy has caused individuals to change their minds about coming to the university or accepting job offers."}
