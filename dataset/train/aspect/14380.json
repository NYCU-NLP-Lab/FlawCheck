This contradicts the claim that she is biased against President Donald Trump.", "President Trump": "s previous praise of Kristen Welker: The expert's verdict highlights that President Trump praised Welker in January when she was named a co-host of NBC's \"Weekend TODAY\" show. This contradicts the claim that she is a \"radical Democrat\" and suggests that Trump had a positive opinion of her in the past.", "The context of a 2012 photo with the Obamas": "The expert's verdict explains that the claim is based on a photo from Welker's Facebook page showing her at a White House holiday party in 2012. However, the expert provides additional information that such parties were common and that the photo does not indicate bias. This challenges the claim's interpretation of the photo as evidence of bias."}
