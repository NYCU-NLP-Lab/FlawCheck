{"The claim is supported by historical research": "The expert mentions filmmaker Ken Burns' timeline in his acclaimed documentary on baseball, which asserts that the first professional baseball team was the Cincinnati Red Stockings of 1869. This historical research provides evidence to support the claim.", "The distinction of being the first all": "professional team: The expert highlights that the Cincinnati Red Stockings were the first all-professional team where players were openly paid. This distinction sets them apart from previous teams where players may have been paid or given jobs, but not as a full team being paid above board.", "Payroll records": "The expert mentions that payroll records for the Cincinnati Red Stockings tally $9,400 for 10 players. This financial documentation further verifies the claim that the team was indeed a professional baseball team.", "Comparison with other teams": "The expert compares the Cincinnati Red Stockings to another team from Washington that toured in the late 1860s. While the Washington team had players on the federal payroll, it is implied that their situation was different from the Red Stockings in terms of being a fully paid professional team."}
