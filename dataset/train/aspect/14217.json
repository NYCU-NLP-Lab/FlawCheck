{"The expert": "s statement that prior to two children's deaths in December, it had been more than a decade since a child died while in the custody of U.S. Customs and Border Protection verifies the inaccuracy of the claim.", "The statement from Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen that": "it has been more than a decade since CBP has had a child pass away in their custody\" further supports the fact that the claim is false.", "The data from U": "S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which shows that none of the 67 immigrants who died while in ICE custody during the Obama years were children, provides additional evidence against the claim.", "The mention of a conservative website": "the Daily Caller, publishing a story with the headline \"18 DEATHS OF ICE DETAINEES ACKNOWLEDGED UNDER OBAMA\" suggests that the claim may stem from a misrepresentation or misinterpretation of this story, further undermining its authenticity."}
