{"The claim is supported by evidence from NBC News": "which reported that the phone number to report Iowa caucus results was posted on a fringe internet message board along with encouragement to \"clog the lines.\" This indicates that the influx of prank calls may have been intentional.", "Messages on the internet forum 4chan urged people to call the number for Iowa caucuses reporting and clog the lines": "Some posts on 4chan explicitly mentioned the intention to tie up the lines and further delay the results.", "Some individuals on 4chan suggested reporting fake results": "including an attempt to report 1,488 votes for Andrew Yang, which is associated with white supremacist symbols. This indicates a deliberate effort to disrupt the accuracy and credibility of the reporting process.", "While the political affiliations of those involved cannot be definitively determined due to the anonymity of 4chan users": "it is clear that most had an anti-Democrat agenda. The Iowa Democratic Party's communications director mentioned that some callers appeared to be supporters of President Trump, suggesting a potential motive behind the prank calls."}
