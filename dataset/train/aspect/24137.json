{"The expert investigated the specific claim made by the National Organization for Marriage": "Rhode Island that religious groups like Knights of Columbus have been forced to allow same-sex marriage ceremonies in their facilities against their beliefs.", "The expert found that the only incident involving the Knights of Columbus mentioned in the claim occurred in Canada": "where two Canadian women booked a Knights of Columbus Hall for their wedding reception. After learning about the nature of the event, the Knights informed the women that they could not use the hall.", "The expert examined the decision of the British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal regarding the incident in Canada": "The tribunal acknowledged that the Knights of Columbus were entitled to constitutional protection and could not be compelled to act against their core religious beliefs. However, it also deemed the Knights' conduct discriminatory and ordered them to pay compensation to the women for injury to their dignity, feelings, and self-respect.", "The expert concluded that": "contrary to the advertisement by the National Organization for Marriage-Rhode Island, the incident in Canada did not force the Knights of Columbus to allow same-sex marriage ceremonies in their facilities."}
