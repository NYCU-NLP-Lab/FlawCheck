{"Chuck Woolery": "s tweet: The claim originated from a tweet by Chuck Woolery, a game show host-turned-conservative pundit, who alleged that Nancy Pelosi's bill for alcohol on her flights from Washington to San Francisco was paid for by taxpayers. He stated that the average cost was $1,000 per week, totaling $52,000 per year.", "Lack of evidence": "The fact-checking expert found zero evidence to support Woolery's claim. Furthermore, Pelosi's office stated that she does not drink alcohol, contradicting the allegation.", "Previous false claim": "The expert noted that Woolery's claim was similar to a previous statement made by Michele Bachmann in 2010. Bachmann accused Pelosi of spending $100,000 on alcohol for flights, but this claim was also debunked.", "Inaccurate figures": "The expert clarified that the documents provided by Woolery, which were originally obtained by Judicial Watch, did not support the claim. The documents mentioned in-flight expenses, including food and alcohol, but the total amount spent on alcohol was much lower than the figures cited by Woolery and Bachmann. Additionally, it was unclear how Woolery arrived at his annual figure of $52,000."}
