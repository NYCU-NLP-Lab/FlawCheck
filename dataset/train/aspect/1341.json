{"Historical evidence": "The experts consulted with historians of American education to verify the claim. They found that the idea for community colleges first emerged in 1901 with the establishment of a program at Central High School in Joliet, Illinois. This program later became Joliet Junior College in 1916. The experts confirmed that the United States was the first place to combine vocational training with education intended for transfer to a four-year school.", "Comparison to other countries": "The experts confirmed that community colleges, as a distinct type of educational institution, were a uniquely American invention. They stated that no other country had done anything like it, supporting Clinton's claim.", "Evolution and institutional development": "While the experts acknowledged that community colleges were not invented out of thin air, they emphasized that it was a self-consciously distinctive institutional development. They highlighted the evolution of community colleges from vocational high schools and their current status as largely public institutions.", "Agreement among experts": "Despite a few minor quibbles, the experts agreed that Clinton was basically right in her claim. Their consensus further adds credibility to the verification of the claim's authenticity."}
