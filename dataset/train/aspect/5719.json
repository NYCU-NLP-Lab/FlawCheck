{"Confirmation from a spokesperson": "The expert's verdict mentions that a spokesperson for Senator Mitt Romney, Arielle Mueller, stated that there is \"absolutely no truth\" to the claim that Romney has been asked to lead Health and Human Services in the Biden administration. This confirmation from a reliable source adds credibility to the verdict.", "Lack of corroboration": "The expert's verdict states that searching online did not yield any evidence to support the claim, except for a deleted headline from a CBS News affiliate. The absence of corroborating evidence suggests that the claim is not authentic.", "Unreliable source": "The expert's verdict highlights that the claim originated from an article on The Buffalo Chronicle, a website known for spreading disinformation. The article cited unnamed sources and lacked a byline, further undermining its credibility.", "Lack of response from the Biden campaign": "The expert's verdict mentions that the Biden campaign did not respond to inquiries about the claim. The lack of a response from the campaign suggests that the claim is not true or has not been considered by the Biden administration."}
