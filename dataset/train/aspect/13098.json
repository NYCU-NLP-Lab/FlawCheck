{"The claim states that Mitt Romney": "paid only 14 percent in taxes - probably less than you.\" The first aspect employed to verify the authenticity of this claim is to analyze the 2010 tax return released by Romney and his wife, which showed $3,009,766 in federal income tax paid on $21,661,344 in adjusted gross income, resulting in an effective tax rate of 13.9 percent.", "Another aspect considered is the comparison of Romney": "s tax rate with the average effective tax rates for Americans in different income brackets. The analysis of a study by the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center reveals that many Americans, particularly those at the lower end of the income scale, have negative tax rates because they receive more from the government than they pay in taxes.", "The expert also takes into account the percentage of taxpayers who likely exceeded Romney": "s 14 percent effective tax rate for income taxes alone. While the exact number is unknown, an educated guess suggests that perhaps 20 to 30 percent of taxpayers surpassed Romney's tax rate, indicating that the claim is incorrect in terms of most taxpayers.", "Additionally": "the expert considers the inclusion of payroll taxes, such as Social Security and Medicare taxes, to calculate the overall tax burden. Payroll taxes are typically included when assessing an employee's tax burden, as they fund specific programs. Ignoring payroll taxes would provide an incomplete picture of an individual's total tax obligations."}
