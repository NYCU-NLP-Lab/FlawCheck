{"The expert clarifies that if the president leaves office": "the vice president becomes the president and nominates a new vice president. This verifies that if Biden were to become president and leave office early, Harris would become president and nominate a vice president.", "The expert states that Nancy Pelosi would not become vice president in the scenario described in the claim": "This contradicts the claim's assertion that Pelosi would become vice president if Biden cannot complete his term.", "The expert explains that the claim": "s scenario is not how vice presidential succession works and provides information on how the U.S. Constitution defines the process. This verifies that the claim is incorrect in its interpretation of the succession process.", "The expert mentions that historically": "the vice presidential slot has not always been filled when the vice president becomes president. This further supports the expert's assertion that Pelosi would not automatically become vice president in the described scenario."}
