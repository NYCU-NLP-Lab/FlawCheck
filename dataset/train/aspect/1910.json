{"The initial claim inaccurately referred to": "life-saving\" care instead of \"life-sustaining\" care, which led to a correction by the expert.", "The claim accurately reflected a portion of Texas law regarding the ability of a hospital review committee to align with a primary physician on continuing or discontinuing life": "sustaining care.", "According to the Texas Health and Safety Code": "if a hospital review committee agrees to end life-sustaining care, the patient or their caregiver has 10 days to find another physician or facility before the hospital is no longer obligated to provide care.", "The law defines": "life-sustaining\" treatment as treatment that sustains the life of a patient without which the patient will die, based on reasonable medical judgment."}
