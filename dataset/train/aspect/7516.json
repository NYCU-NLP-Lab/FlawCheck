{"Lack of specific details": "The expert notes that the article lacks specific details, such as the name of the man involved in the incident or the hospital where he received treatment. This lack of specific information raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Absence of reports in reputable sources": "The expert mentions that they searched for reports about the incident in Canadian publications like The Calgary Herald, the CBC, and CTV but found no mention of a man cutting off his penis with a fidget spinner adorned with blades. The absence of any credible reports or coverage further casts doubt on the claim's authenticity.", "Previous instances of fake news": "The expert points out that this claim is not the first fake news story to be generated in relation to the fidget spinner craze. They mention other false claims like a fidget spinner getting lodged in a woman's vagina, altering the earth's gravity, or causing a schoolteacher to lose an eye. This context of previous fake news stories adds to the skepticism surrounding the current claim.", "Source credibility": "The expert highlights that the website United News, which published the article, purports to be a genuine news site but has several signs of being fake. The lack of quality journalism, grammatical errors in their mission statement, and the absence of permission to reproduce the material all contribute to questioning the authenticity of the claim."}
