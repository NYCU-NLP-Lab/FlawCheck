Meanwhile, the bottom 90 percent, which included 144 million families with an average wealth of $84,000, owned an equal 22.8 percent of America's wealth.", "Other prominent economists": "such as Thomas Piketty of the Paris School of Economics and Edward Wolff of New York University, have supported the study's estimates on wealth inequality. However, there have been some concerns raised by other economists regarding the study's findings."}
