{"Lack of official announcement from YouTube": "The expert's verdict states that a spokeswoman for Google, which owns YouTube, confirmed that the video-sharing platform did not make any announcement regarding the claim of 600 million views on the Tanzanian president's speech. This lack of official confirmation from YouTube raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Inaccurate claims in the Facebook post": "The expert's verdict mentions that the Facebook post circulating in Tanzania made several bogus claims, including the number of countries and heads of state supposedly following the speech, as well as accolades from a Thai website and a British political magazine. The presence of false information in the post further questions the credibility of the claim.", "Limited viewership on YouTube": "The expert's verdict reveals that a search on YouTube using specific Swahili keywords related to the speech resulted in several videos, but none of them had garnered views anywhere close to the claimed 600 million. The highest amount of viewership found was only around 158,000 views. This significant discrepancy in viewership numbers casts doubt on the claim's authenticity.", "No evidence of UK government business halt": "The expert's verdict states that there were no reports in reputable British and international media about Prime Minister Boris Johnson shutting down government business to watch the speech. Additionally, searches on UK government sites and Johnson's official Twitter account did not reveal any directive to close government business. This lack of evidence contradicts one of the claims made in the Facebook post and adds to the skepticism surrounding the authenticity of the claim."}
