{"Michele Bachmann": "s claim that Donald Trump's polling numbers show that he's \"the highest with Hispanics that any Republican has ever been\" is contradicted by multiple news sources, including the Wall Street Journal, CNN, Politico, and Gallup, which all indicate that Hispanics hold a negative view of Trump.", "PunditFact wanted to verify Bachmann": "s claim and reached out to her spokesperson, but they did not respond to their messages, leaving the claim unverified.", "The Gallup poll shows that the broader Hispanic view of Trump is strongly negative": "with more Hispanics having a very unfavorable view of him compared to voters of all backgrounds.", "Mark Hugo Lopez": "the director of Hispanic polling at the Pew Research Center, explains that while Hispanics are not a monolithic voting bloc, most Hispanic registered voters lean toward the Democratic Party, and the Republican share accounts for only about 25 percent. Therefore, it is important to consider the opinions of Republican Hispanic registered voters, but they have not been extensively surveyed in this early stage of the election cycle."}
