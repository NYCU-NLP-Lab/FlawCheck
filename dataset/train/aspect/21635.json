{"Total number of tests conducted": "The expert's verdict acknowledges that the United States has conducted the most tests for COVID-19 compared to any other country. The claim emphasizes the significance of this aspect in determining America's leadership in testing.", "Per": "capita testing comparison: The expert's verdict mentions that per-capita testing is a better gauge of countries' testing efforts. Both President Trump and Adm. Brett Giroir cited per-capita measures, claiming that the United States is testing more people per capita than several other countries. However, the expert points out that these claims were misleading as they omitted countries that have performed better in this regard.", "Apples": "to-apples comparison challenges: The expert's verdict highlights the challenges in comparing testing efforts across different countries. Factors such as units, inclusion of all labs, inclusion of negative and pending tests, and other aspects can vary, making it difficult to perform accurate comparisons.", "Other metrics for measuring testing leadership": "The expert's verdict suggests that testing leadership should not solely be determined by the total number of tests or per-capita testing. It implies that there might be additional metrics or aspects that could provide a more comprehensive understanding of a country's testing efforts, but these are not explicitly mentioned in the given information."}
