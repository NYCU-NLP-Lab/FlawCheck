{"Lack of evidence from the Times Square Church": "The expert's verdict highlights that the Times Square Church, which was founded by David Wilkerson, stated that they are not aware of Wilkerson ever making this prediction in any of his books or sermons. This lack of evidence from the church raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Unresponsive Jerusalem Prayer Team": "The expert mentions that PolitiFact reached out to the Jerusalem Prayer Team, the organization that posted the claim, but did not receive a response to multiple inquiries. This lack of response from the organization raises questions about their credibility and the veracity of the claim.", "Inconsistent details in the Facebook post": "The expert points out that the Facebook post instructs readers to click on a link to find video, transcript, and a prophetic message from Mike Evans, the leading pastor of the Jerusalem Prayer Team. However, the claim itself attributes the prophecy to David Wilkerson, not Mike Evans. This inconsistency in the details of the claim raises doubts about its accuracy.", "Lack of explicit connection to the coronavirus and New York City": "The expert mentions that while the Book of Isaiah in the Bible does address a plague that forces people to stay inside and shuts down an economy, it does not explicitly mention the coronavirus hitting New York City. This lack of a direct connection between the prophecy and the specific circumstances mentioned in the claim weakens its authenticity."}
