{"The source of the claim": "The expert analyzed the original tweet by Payal Rohatgi, which included a photograph of people offering Namaz on the road in India. They also looked at the caption used to share the photograph on a Facebook page and the screenshot from a Facebook group.", "Image verification": "The expert conducted a reverse image search on Google and found that the photograph was originally uploaded on a website called \"robertharding.com.\" The website described the photograph as Muslims praying on the road in Tongi, Bangladesh. The expert also found similar photographs from the same location on Getty Images.", "Credibility of the source": "The expert mentioned that Payal Rohatgi is a known figure and senior editor at Alt News, which suggests that she has some credibility. However, it is important to note that being a senior editor does not necessarily make someone an expert in verifying claims.", "Geographic location": "The expert highlighted that the photograph was taken in Bangladesh, not India. This contradicts the claim that the road was blocked by people offering Namaz in India. Thus, the geographic location of the photograph was an important aspect in verifying the authenticity of the claim."}
