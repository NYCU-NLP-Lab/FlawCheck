{"Outdated and unreliable data": "The expert's verdict highlights that the information available regarding the number of orphans living in institutions is outdated and unreliable. The 8 million figure has been floating around for decades and originates from a 1985 report. A more recent estimate by UNICEF puts the number at 2 million, but underreporting and lack of data collection in many countries make it difficult to determine the accurate figure.", "Source credibility": "The expert mentions that the data relied upon by Lumos, the organization making the claim, comes from credible sources. However, it is important to note that the expert also questions the reliability of this data due to its outdated nature and potential underreporting.", "Estimation by a reputable charity": "The claim about 80 percent of children in institutions not being orphans is based on an estimate by Save the Children, an international children's rights charity. While the charity claims that \"four out of five children in institutional care have one or both parents alive,\" it is unclear how this estimate was derived and if it is representative of the global situation.", "Regional variations": "The expert mentions that the numbers vary greatly by individual orphanage and region of the world. UNICEF reports regional differences, such as 77 percent of children in orphanages in Cambodia in 2009 having at least one living parent, while in Zimbabwe, the percentage was lower at 39 percent. These regional variations highlight the complexity and context-specific nature of the issue."}
