{"The expert reviewed data from the U": "S. Bureau of Labor Statistics to verify the claim. The data showed that in August, the public sector shed 17,000 jobs, supporting the claim that government workers have been laid off.", "The expert examined a radio interview with U": "S. Rep. Bill Pascrell, who made the claim. Pascrell mentioned the loss of public jobs and cited a figure of \"six to seven hundred thousand\" government workers laid off in the last year and a half. While the exact time frame mentioned by Pascrell was not accurate, the expert found that in the past 18 months, 512,000 government jobs were lost, which is in the same range as Pascrell's claim.", "The expert analyzed an article from U": "S. News & World Report, which stated that government employment, including federal, state, and local jobs, had fallen by roughly 600,000 since the end of the recession. The expert confirmed that the actual number was 595,000 according to seasonally-adjusted federal data. This information supported the claim made by Pascrell.", "The expert considered the overall impact of public": "sector job losses on the nation's job growth. While there is debate on whether smaller government is better for the economy, the expert focused on verifying the claim regarding the number of government workers laid off. The expert found that the decrease in public-sector jobs in the past 18 months offset the net job growth by nearly 21 percent, providing evidence for the claim."}
