{"The release of Mary Trump": "s tell-all book: The expert mentions that the book, titled \"Too Much and Never Enough: How My Family Created the World\u2019s Most Dangerous Man,\" was released in July 2020 by publisher Simon & Schuster. This establishes the existence of the book and its availability for verification.", "Lack of shocking or surprising information": "The expert notes that while various news outlets reported on the book's contents before its publication, it did not contain much new information that was truly shocking or surprising. This suggests that the claim may not be supported by the book's content.", "Absence of the specific claim in the book": "The expert states that the purported excerpt circulated on social media, describing Mary Trump walking in on her uncle Donald in bed with his daughter Ivanka, was a fabrication. They mention that news outlets that obtained pre-release copies of the book did not mention such an occurrence, and a search of the book's official release also yielded no description matching the claim. This highlights the lack of evidence supporting the specific claim.", "A related but different passage in the book": "The expert identifies a paragraph in the book that bears a slight resemblance to the fabricated excerpt but does not match it closely. This passage describes a scene where Donald Trump is with his kids, including Ivanka, and they engage in playful wrestling while he watches. This provides an alternative description that does not align with the claim of walking in on them in bed."}
