{"Investigation of the source": "The expert examined the origin of the claim, which was a tweet posted on Twitter on January 27, 2019. They found that the accompanying photograph used in the claim was actually taken on January 22, 2013, and featured in the Canadian news outlet the National Post. This investigation helped to verify the authenticity of the claim.", "Verification from authorities": "The expert contacted the Chicago police to gather more information about the claim. They discovered that only seven deaths in various states were linked to the extreme cold front at that time, and none of the reported victims were listed as homeless. This verification from the authorities helped to cast doubt on the claim.", "Analysis of available data": "The expert examined the record-low temperatures in Chicago during the period mentioned in the claim, which reached -23\u00b0F with a wind chill of -52\u00b0F. They also noted the closure of schools and other facilities, the designation of warming centers, and the extended operating hours of senior centers in response to the extreme weather. This analysis provided context and supported the conclusion that the claim of 15 homeless people found dead on the streets was suspect.", "Comparison with other reports": "The expert compared the information obtained from the investigation, verification, and analysis with other reports and news sources. They found that the only fatality reported in Chicago during the storm was an unidentified man hit by a snowplow. This comparison helped to further discredit the claim and establish its lack of authenticity."}
