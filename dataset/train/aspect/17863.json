{"Language discrepancy": "The letter is written in English, which is unlikely as the University of Bern, located in Switzerland, would have communicated with Einstein in German, the predominant language in the country.", "Anachronistic letterhead": "The letterhead on the image bears the address of the modern-day Albert Einstein Center for Fundamental Physics and references a postal code that was not in use in 1907. This suggests that the letter is a modern creation and not from the time period claimed.", "Inaccurate references": "The letter mentions a dean named Wilhelm Heinrich, who did not exist at the University of Bern during that time. Additionally, the circular stamp at the bottom of the letter does not correspond to the university and appears to depict the coat of arms of Hungary.", "Faculty separation": "The letter refers to a \"Dean of Science,\" but in 1907, the Faculty of Science and the Faculty of Humanities had not yet been separated at the University of Bern. Therefore, the mention of a specific dean in this context is inaccurate."}
