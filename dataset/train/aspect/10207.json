{"The Congressional Budget Act of 1974": "The expert's verdict mentions that the budget process used by Congress today was set forth in the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. This act outlines the framework for future bills that address spending, taxation, and other fiscal policy items. It establishes the process by which the House and Senate are supposed to pass resolutions in the spring, representing a plan for allocating revenues and expenditures for the coming fiscal year.", "Passing a budget resolution": "The expert's verdict explains that the House is expected to pass a budget resolution each year, outlining the framework for future bills related to fiscal policy. This resolution is distinct from the series of appropriations bills that actually allocate money for specific purposes. The passage of a budget resolution reflects the majority's organizational skills and the degree of partisan discord in Congress.", "Historical records": "The expert's verdict mentions that according to the Congressional Research Service, the nonpartisan research arm of Congress, the House has passed a budget every year since the Congressional Budget Act took effect in 1976. This historical record verifies the claim that the House has never failed to pass a budget in the modern era.", "Lack of contradictory evidence": "The expert's verdict does not mention any contradictory evidence or instances where the House failed to pass a budget in the modern era. The absence of such evidence supports the claim's authenticity."}
