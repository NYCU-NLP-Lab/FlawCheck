{"The claim is based on a misinterpretation of a quote from": "The Simpsons Movie\" where Tom Hanks says, \"This is Tom Hanks, saying, if you see me in person, leave me be.\" This quote is unrelated to any prediction of Tom Hanks getting coronavirus.", "The claim is further debunked by the fact that": "The Simpsons Movie\" is about an environmental crisis, not a health crisis. There is no reference to any kind of outbreak in the movie.", "The connection between": "The Simpsons\" and real-life events has been exaggerated in the past, with many purported connections being far-fetched. This casts doubt on the claim that the show predicted Tom Hanks getting coronavirus.", "The article that made the claim was flagged by Facebook as part of their efforts to combat false news and misinformation": "This suggests that the claim lacks credibility and should be treated with skepticism."}
