{"The panel of federal judges unanimously ruled that the North Carolina lawmakers violated the U": "S. Constitution's equal-protection clause by drawing maps explicitly to favor their party. This ruling indicates that the claim of the GOP-drawn U.S. Congressional maps being unconstitutional partisan gerrymanders holds weight.", "The term": "gerrymandering\" has a historical origin from the 1800s, when a critic compared a district to a salamander. The chairman of the N.C. GOP, Robin Hayes, and the executive director, Dallas Woodhouse, argue that the definition of gerrymandering includes an \"eye\" test, where bizarre-looking districts are considered objectionable. They believe that the GOP-drawn maps do not fit this definition.", "State Senate leader Phil Berger falsely claimed that North Carolina has the": "strictest anti-gerrymandering standards in the country.\" This statement suggests that the GOP leaders have been actively promoting the notion that their maps adhere to fair and non-partisan principles.", "While district shapes can be an indicator of gerrymandering": "experts emphasize that they are not the sole determinant. The judges' ruling and expert opinions suggest that there are other aspects beyond district shapes that were considered in assessing the authenticity of the claim."}
