{"Lack of evidence": "The expert's verdict highlights that there is no evidence to support the claim that there was a communications blackout in Washington, DC between 1am and 6am on June 1, 2020. This lack of evidence undermines the authenticity of the claim.", "Statements from authorities": "The expert's verdict includes statements from official sources such as the Metropolitan Police Department and Netblocks, a civil society group that monitors internet shutdowns. These authorities state that there was no indication of a mass-scale internet disruption or cell phone blackout during the specified time period. Their statements add credibility to the conclusion that the claim is not authentic.", "Social media investigations": "The expert's verdict mentions investigations conducted on social media platforms. Twitter, for example, stated that it is actively investigating the hashtag and has suspended accounts that were found to be spreading false or misleading information. This indicates that social media platforms are taking action to combat the dissemination of misinformation.", "Analysis of misinformation tactics": "The expert's verdict includes analysis by Alex Engler, a fellow at the Brookings Institution, who specializes in artificial intelligence and policy. Engler points out that false or misleading content was shared under the hashtag, and he highlights a specific tweet that claimed phones in DC were \"jammed.\" This analysis sheds light on the tactics used by those spreading misinformation and further undermines the authenticity of the claim."}
