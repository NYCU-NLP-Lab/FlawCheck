{"The claim is based on an advertisement by Republican Rep": "Duncan Hunter's campaign, which accuses Ammar Campa-Najjar of working to infiltrate Congress and being supported by CAIR and the Muslim Brotherhood.", "The advertisement uses rhetoric that seeks to paint Campa": "Najjar as someone with ties to Islamist terrorists, specifically mentioning his grandfather's alleged involvement in the Munich Olympic massacre.", "The authenticity of the claim is challenged by the fact that Campa": "Najjar is actually a Christian and has a long-standing commitment to his faith, as attested by a statement from his pastor.", "The assertion that Campa": "Najjar is being supported by CAIR and the Muslim Brotherhood is deemed inaccurate, as there is no evidence to support this claim."}
