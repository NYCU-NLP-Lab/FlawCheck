{"The claim is supported by data from the Sentencing Project": "a criminal justice reform advocacy organization, which states that the current incarcerated population has grown by 500 percent over the past 40 years.", "The state and federal prison population has increased by nearly 600 percent from 1974 to 2014": "while the overall United States population has only increased by 51 percent during the same period.", "The increase in incarceration can be attributed to the war on drugs": "which was initiated by President Richard Nixon and strengthened by President Ronald Reagan. The stricter drug policies, including mandatory minimum sentences and new asset forfeiture rules, have contributed to the rise in the number of people incarcerated for drug-related offenses.", "The increase in incarceration is primarily driven by drug crimes": "with more people being admitted to prisons for drug offenses each year than for violent or property crimes."}
