{"Historical precedent": "The expert's verdict mentions that the high-water mark for tax return disclosure was set by Sen. Robert Dole in 1996, who released 30 years of tax returns. This historical precedent indicates that it is not typical for presidential candidates to release only 10 or 11 years of tax returns.", "Comparison to other candidates": "The expert's verdict compares the number of tax returns released by different candidates in various elections. It highlights that candidates like Sen. John Kerry, George Romney, and Bill Clinton released 12 years of tax returns, while others like Sen. John Edwards released 10 years. This comparison suggests that releasing a decade's worth of tax returns is more common than just 10 or 11 years.", "Incumbent and challenger practices": "The expert's verdict explains that sitting presidents and vice presidents have released their taxes each year they are in office, and by the time re-election rolls around, they have put at least four tax returns into the public record. This distinction between incumbents and challengers implies that candidates usually release more than just a few years of tax returns.", "Factcheck": "org analysis: The expert's verdict mentions that Factcheck.org conducted an analysis and found that since 1980, only two general election candidates have revealed just two years of tax returns. Although the specific findings of this analysis are not provided, the mention of it suggests that the analysis supports the notion that releasing 10 or 11 years of tax returns is not typical for presidential candidates."}
