{"The claim that Iceland forgave the entire mortgage debt of its population is false": "Reports from 2012, including those from reputable U.S. media outlets, clearly stated that while Iceland forgave a significant amount of mortgage debt to aid in the country's economic recovery, it did not involve wiping out all home mortgages held by all citizens.", "The assertion of a": "total US media blackout\" preventing Americans from learning about Iceland's debt forgiveness is unfounded. Multiple sources, including Bloomberg, Think Progress, NPR, and the Washington Post, had reported on this issue well before 2016, debunking the notion of media censorship.", "The origin of the claim can be traced back to a 2012 news broadcast on the Spanish": "language network TeleSur. The choice of this source by Disclose TV was likely intended to perpetuate the idea of a media blackout, even though it was not the case.", "The lack of search results on Google in 2016 when querying": "ICELAND FORGIVES ENTIRE POPULATION OF MORTGAGE DEBT\" from the United States does not indicate a media blackout. This can be attributed to the fact that the event was three years in the past and the claim itself was false."}
