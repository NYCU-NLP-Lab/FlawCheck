{"Confirmation from the representative of Westbury Dairies": "The expert's verdict states that a representative of Westbury Dairies, the dairy where Anchor Butter is produced, confirmed through email that the claim is false. This confirmation from a reliable source adds credibility to the debunking of the claim.", "Lack of reporting by BBC News": "The expert's verdict mentions that a search of the BBC News website did not yield any articles or videos reporting the contamination of butter or any other dairy product in the UK with HIV-infected blood. This absence of credible news reports further supports the conclusion that the claim is false.", "Unoriginality of the claim": "The expert's verdict highlights that the Anchor Butter claim is an unoriginal update of an internet hoax that has been circulating for several years. Similar false claims have been made about various food and beverage items being contaminated with HIV. This pattern of unoriginality suggests that the claim is not based on factual information.", "Clarification from the Centers for Disease Control": "CDC): The expert's verdict includes information from the CDC, stating that HIV cannot be transmitted through food handled by an HIV-infected person. The CDC further explains that even if the food contained small amounts of HIV-infected blood or semen, exposure to air, heat from cooking, and stomach acid would destroy the virus. This clarification from a reputable health organization reinforces the conclusion that the claim is not authentic."}
