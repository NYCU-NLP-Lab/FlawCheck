{"The claim is based on a fabricated Facebook post that includes a picture of Rashida Tlaib": "a screenshot of a purported tweet, commentary by another Twitter user, and a description claiming it was her comment on the Protesters Siege of the U.S. Embassy in Iraq.", "The alleged tweet by Tlaib": "which states \"Americans have spent decades raping and pillaging my people. What goes around comes around. #FridayFeeling,\" was never actually posted by her.", "The hoax tweet originated from another user who tried to make it seem like a real account for Tlaib": "Tlaib's verified Twitter account has a blue checkmark badge next to her name.", "Tlaib herself has publicly addressed the issue": "stating that if there isn't a checkmark next to her name on a tweet, it's fake, and urging people to focus on disagreeing with her based on facts rather than spreading lies."}
