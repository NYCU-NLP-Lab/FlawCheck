["The message shared along with the video stated, \u201cBarkha Dutt\n   justifying Kashmiri Pandit\u2019s genocide\u201d.", "Moreover, the summarized caption published along with the video further\n   confirms that Dutt\u2019s reportage was not a justification of the massacre but\n   focused on the impoverished conditions of Kashmiri Pandits since they were\n   forced out of the Valley in 1990.", "Video placed out-of-context\n\n   Barkha Dutt introduces the report by explaining the misery of forgotten\n   and marginalised Kashmiri Pandits.", "In the\n   above case, a reportage sympathetic to the plight of displaced Kashmiri\n   Pandits was viciously truncated into a 23-second clip to suggest that\n   journalist Barkha Dutt was justifying ethnic cleansing."]
