{"The misleading headline": "The expert's verdict highlights that the headline of the article is extremely misleading, creating a false impression about Muslims planning something disturbing after grocery stores go bare to prepare for Hurricane Irma.", "Accurate text but biased commentary": "The expert's verdict mentions that while the text of the article itself may be more accurate, the website adds its own biased commentary to reports from the media and other sources about the Islamic State's poisoning of prisoners and the potential for their followers to poison Western grocery stores.", "Lack of specific claims": "The expert's verdict notes that the article does not make any specific claims about active plots discovered against American supermarkets. It only mentions the possibility of ISIS utilizing social media to instruct members to poison food in supermarkets, without any concrete evidence or incidents.", "Citing unreliable sources": "The expert's verdict highlights that the website Freedom Daily links to other sources such as The Federalist Papers Project and Newsweek, which may not be reliable or credible sources of information. This raises concerns about the overall authenticity and accuracy of the claim made in the article."}
