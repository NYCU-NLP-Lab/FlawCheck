{"Prior to the adoption of Florida Amendment 4": "convicted felons in Florida were not allowed to vote during their time serving their sentences. However, the amendment now grants the right to vote to felons who have completed their sentences, with the exception of those convicted of murder or felony sex offenses.", "The claim that Parkland shooter Nikolas Cruz registered to vote as a Republican from jail is true": "Andrew Pollack, the father of one of the victims, tweeted a photograph of Cruz's voter registration, which showed that he registered to vote on July 25, 2018, while behind bars using the jail's address as his mailing address.", "Individuals who are being held in jail awaiting trial but have not yet been convicted of any crime are still eligible to register to vote and to vote": "This means that Cruz, who has yet to face trial for the crime he confessed to, was able to register and would have been allowed to cast a vote in the 2018 midterm elections.", "Broward County sheriff": "s office spokesperson Veda Coleman-Wright confirmed that allowing inmates to register and vote before their trials is a constitutional right. In previous elections, several inmates from the same jail where Cruz is held had registered and voted. Not allowing Cruz this right would be considered unconstitutional."}
