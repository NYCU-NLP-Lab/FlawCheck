{"The geographical location of the incident": "The expert analyzed the claim and pointed out that Missouri is a landlocked state far from any ocean, making it highly unlikely for a shark to be present in the floodwaters.", "Physical characteristics of the flood": "The expert observed that the floodwaters in the photograph were only thigh-high, suggesting a shallow depth. This contradicts the habitat requirements of ocean-going great white sharks.", "Verification of the image": "The expert mentioned that a larger version of the image showed that the entire road was not flooded, indicating that the photograph had been manipulated or misrepresented.", "Historical context and previous circulation": "The expert highlighted that the image had been circulating online since at least 2000, attached to floodwaters in various locations such as Ireland, Houston, England, and New Orleans. This indicated a pattern of the image being falsely associated with different incidents."}
