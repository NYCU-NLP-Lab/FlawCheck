{"Giuliani distorted the facts by repeatedly claiming that there was": "no obstruction\" by President Trump, despite the Mueller report stating that it did not exonerate him and that it was unable to reach a judgment on whether obstruction of justice occurred.", "Giuliani attempted to compare Trump to Clinton by claiming that Clinton": "actually obstructed justice\" during a federal investigation into her mishandling of classified information. However, the FBI director stated that they did not develop evidence of obstruction by Clinton or her staff.", "Giuliani pointed to Clinton": "s actions of crushing cell phones, deleting emails, and bleaching a server as evidence of obstruction, but the Mueller report did not find any comparable actions by Trump.", "The Mueller report stated that if they had confidence that the President clearly did not commit obstruction of justice": "they would state so, but they were unable to reach that judgment based on the facts and applicable legal standards. Mueller also did not recommend prosecution, citing difficult legal issues that would need to be resolved."}
