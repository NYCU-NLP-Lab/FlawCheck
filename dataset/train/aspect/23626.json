{"The claim suggests that House Democrats want to give the right to vote to noncitizens": "but the expert's verdict clarifies that this is a misleading interpretation of the situation.", "The Facebook post in question refers to HR 1": "a bill that calls for sweeping changes to voting rights and campaign finance.

This highlights the complexity of the issue and the need for a nuanced understanding."}
