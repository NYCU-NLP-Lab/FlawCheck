{"Lack of evidence": "The expert's verdict highlights that the claim of Black Lives Matter members and supporters tampering with or poisoning fast food orders is baseless and lacks any supporting evidence. The absence of any news reports or public health crisis related to this claim further undermines its authenticity.", "Origin as a meme": "The claim originated as a meme on Facebook, which is a form of copypasta. Copypasta refers to a block of text that is repeatedly copied and pasted across various online platforms. The use of a meme as the source of the claim raises doubts about its credibility and suggests that it may have been created for entertainment or to spread misinformation.", "Problematic assumptions": "The expert points out that the underlying assumptions made by the meme are problematic. The claim implies a nationwide conspiracy to poison fast food orders, which would likely receive significant media attention. However, there are no news reports or evidence supporting such a widespread public health crisis. The meme's assumptions are baseless and lack any factual basis.", "Previous false rumors": "The expert mentions a previous false rumor circulating in 2020 about police officers being poisoned at a Shake Shack. A police investigation found no criminal activity in that case. This reference to a similar false rumor reinforces the lack of credibility in the claim regarding Black Lives Matter members and supporters tampering with fast food orders. It suggests a pattern of unfounded rumors being spread during the protests, further undermining the claim's authenticity."}
