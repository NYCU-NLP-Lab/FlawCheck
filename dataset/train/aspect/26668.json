{"Former Utah Gov": "Jon Huntsman's claim: During the Republican presidential debate in Ames, Iowa, on Aug. 11, 2011, Huntsman claimed that Utah had \"historic tax cuts\" and \"created a flat tax in the state of Utah.\"", "Huntsman": "s actions as governor: Huntsman began pushing for tax changes soon after taking office in January 2005. He aimed to create a tax policy that was friendly to citizens and created a competitive environment for businesses.", "Changes in tax law": "Huntsman and the Legislature achieved their goal of creating a flatter tax system by implementing two changes in tax law over two years. They replaced the previous six income tax brackets with a single rate of 5 percent, eliminating most deductions and credits. However, the research arm of the Utah Legislature noted that the new system, although having a single rate, was not a pure flat tax as it still had some progressive elements through tax credits."}
