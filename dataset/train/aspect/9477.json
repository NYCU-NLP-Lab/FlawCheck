{"Lack of original source": "The expert's investigation found no evidence of an original source for the quote attributed to Donald Trump about reading \"Mein Kampf\" and admiring Adolf Hitler. This raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Absence of media references": "The expert found no references in the media to Trump making such a statement. If Trump had actually made this claim, it would likely have been widely reported, but no such references were found.", "Fabricated nature of the quote": "The language and style of the quote resemble Trump's speaking style, but the expert concluded that the passage appears to be fabricated. The lack of verifiable sources and the fact that the quote only surfaced in 2019 further support this conclusion.", "Trump": "s mistaken reference to Mein Kampf: While Trump was quoted in 1990 as saying he had been given a copy of a book by Hitler, it was later revealed that he was mistaken about the specific book. This suggests that Trump may not have a deep knowledge or admiration for Hitler's writings."}
