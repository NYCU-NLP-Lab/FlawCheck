{"Lack of archaeological proof": "The expert points out that the viral message and accompanying photograph are not considered archaeological proof of the claim. They highlight that scriptural writings of many religions may include tales of giant men, but this does not validate the specific claim in question.", "Reference to religious texts": "The claim mentions the Quran and the people of Aad, stating that God created people of phenomenal size in the past. The expert notes that while this may be mentioned in religious texts, it does not serve as concrete evidence for the authenticity of the claim.", "Secrecy and restricted access": "The claim suggests that the Saudi Military has secured the area where the giant skeleton was discovered, allowing only ARAMCO personnel to enter. The expert acknowledges this aspect but does not consider it as conclusive evidence, as restricted access can be implemented for various reasons.", "Source of the photograph": "The expert reveals that the image used to support the claim was actually an entry from a digital editing competition on the website Worth1000. They explain that the altered version of a real photograph from an excavation site was combined with a fictitious backstory, creating a hoax. This aspect discredits the authenticity of the claim."}
