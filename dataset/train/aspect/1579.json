{"Ample evidence exists to show that Columbus was responsible for forcing thousands of natives on the Caribbean islands into slave labor": "as well as seizing, selling, distributing, and exporting many native women and children, with either foreknowledge of, or indifference to, their fate as sex slaves.", "The specific quotation offered as evidence in a widely shared meme": "although accurate and authentic, came from a longer passage written by Columbus. In context, Columbus was neutrally describing the specific practice of buying and selling nine-year-old girls, and in that particular letter, he neither endorsed it nor condemned it, nor admitted to personally taking part in it.", "The veracity of the claim was questioned and investigated by readers in May 2018": "leading to a deeper examination of Columbus's historical actions and their impact on the native peoples of the Caribbean islands.", "The quote attributed to Columbus in the meme is accurate and was taken from a letter he wrote in 1500 to Do\u00f1a Juana de la Torre": "a nurse in the royal court of Queen Isabella and the sister of one of Columbus' leading crew members on his second voyage to the Americas. This letter was written at a time when Columbus had been removed as Governor of the American territories due to reports of misgovernment and brutal treatment of natives."}
