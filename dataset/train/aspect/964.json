{"The absence of any documented cases of secret pardons": "The expert highlights that while it is theoretically possible for a president to issue secret pardons, there has never been any documented evidence of such pardons in the past. This lack of historical precedent raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "The interpretation of the Constitution": "The expert points out that the Constitution does not explicitly restrict the president from issuing secret pardons. However, the Constitution's language regarding presidential clemency power is limited to granting reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States, excluding cases of impeachment. This aspect highlights the legal ambiguity surrounding the validity of secret pardons.", "The proposed Presidential Pardon Transparency Act": "U.S. Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi introduced a bill that would require all presidential pardons to be disclosed to the public within three days of being issued. This act emphasizes the importance of transparency in presidential pardoning activities and suggests that there is a need to ensure that the American people are aware of how the president is using their office. The existence of this proposed legislation indicates a recognition of the potential problems associated with secret pardons.", "The public nature of pardons": "The expert and other legal professionals argue that the public nature of pardons is crucial for their validity. Former U.S. Pardon Attorney Margaret Colgate Love states that the whole idea of a pardon is that it is a public document, and the concept of a pardon being kept secret goes against its purpose. The public nature of pardons also serves as a means of authentication, requiring witnesses and proof of timing. This aspect raises doubts about the effectiveness and legitimacy of secret pardons."}
