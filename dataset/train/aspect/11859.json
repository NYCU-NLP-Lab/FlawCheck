{"Sen": "Rand Paul's claim that most people below $50,000 don't pay any income tax was verified by the official tax analysis for Congress, the Joint Committee on Taxation, which found that every income group below $50,000 paid a negative average share of the income burden, meaning they received deductions and credits that reduced their federal income tax liability below zero.", "The top 1": "in the country paying 40% of the income tax was also supported by the same analysis from the Joint Committee on Taxation, which showed that the top 1.2% of tax filers, earning at least $500,000, collectively paid 51.5% of the nation's individual income tax bill.", "However": "when considering other federal taxes such as payroll and excise taxes, the burden shifts. The analysis by the Joint Committee on Taxation revealed that those earning less than $50,000 paid 4.3% of all federal taxes, while those earning over $500,000 had their share of the tax burden decline to 30.7% when factoring in these additional taxes.", "An annual analysis by the IRS in 2017 found that the top 1": "paid 38.5% of federal income taxes, and taxpayers earning under $50,000 paid 5.98% of income taxes. While not matching Paul's claim exactly, it still indicates that lower-income individuals contribute to the income tax burden, albeit at a lower rate than higher-income individuals."}
