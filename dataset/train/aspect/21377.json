{"The image accompanying the claim is a famous Lewis Hine photo taken in 1911": "not a depiction of white children from Ireland being shipped as slaves in 1619.", "The claim about white": "Irish slaves gained traction on social media after a congressional hearing on reparations for African Americans, suggesting a potential political motivation behind the spread of this misinformation.", "History professor Leslie Harris and research librarian Liam Hogan": "both experts on claims of Irish slavery, have debunked this specific claim and image, stating that Irish people were not enslaved in the Americas, and that people of African descent far outnumbered European migrants before the 19th century.", "In 1619": "100 \"poor English children\" were taken from the streets of London and sent to Virginia as indentured servants, which was an extension of the English Poor Law of 1601. This is a separate historical event from the transatlantic slave trade involving Africans, which saw thousands of voyages and around 500,000 individuals being enslaved."}
