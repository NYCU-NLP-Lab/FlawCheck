{"Lack of evidence from official sources": "The expert's verdict highlights that there is no evidence to suggest that either Trump or Biden made the claim in question. The official press briefing and Twitter accounts of both individuals do not contain any mention of the specific phrase attributed to them.", "Timing and sequence of posts": "The expert notes that the Facebook posts attributing the quote to Biden came after those attributing it to Trump. This raises questions about the credibility of the claim, as it suggests a possible attempt to spread misinformation or false attributions.", "Absence of the phrase in Biden": "s speeches and social media: The expert mentions that a search of Biden's Twitter history and available speeches in March does not yield any instances of the phrase in question. This further undermines the authenticity of the claim.", "Historical usage of the phrase": "The expert points out that the phrase \"people are dying who never died before\" has been used in a joking manner and attributed to various individuals since as early as 2008. This historical context suggests that the claim may be a misattribution or a fabrication."}
