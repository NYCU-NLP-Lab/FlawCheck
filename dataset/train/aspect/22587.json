{"Arrests and police investigations": "At least three teens have been arrested on suspicion of committing hate crimes for posting images mimicking the death of George Floyd. Similar images have also led to police investigations and arrests in other countries like the United Kingdom and Australia.", "Social media presence": "The claim states that the phenomenon of posting photos mimicking George Floyd's death is widespread and happening on various social media platforms including Snapchat, Twitter, TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook. The images have gone viral and spread across multiple platforms.", "Unknown origins and intent": "Some images tagged as part of the challenge have unknown origins, and it is difficult to establish the precise intent of those who participated in them. This raises questions about whether all participants were mocking or imitating George Floyd's death, or if some were unaware of the implications.", "Relatively small participation": "While the claim suggests a widespread effort, the expert's verdict mentions that the number of people actually participating in the behavior seems to be relatively small. This indicates that the phenomenon may not be as widespread as initially portrayed."}
