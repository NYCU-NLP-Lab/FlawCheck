{"The claim made by President Donald Trump on July 26": "2017, stating that transgender people would be banned from serving in the military due to the \"tremendous medical costs and disruption\" they would entail.", "The government": "funded report released by the RAND Corp. that estimated the additional cost of allowing transgender people to openly serve in the military. The report found that the cost would range from $2.4 million to $8.4 million annually, representing a 0.04% to 0.13% increase in active-component health care expenditures. It also stated that less than 0.1% of the total force would seek transition-related care that could disrupt their ability to deploy.", "The commissioning of the RAND report by the Defense Department after then": "Secretary Ash Carter announced in July 2015 that the military would study the policy and readiness implications of welcoming transgender persons to serve openly. This indicates that there was a deliberate effort to gather information and assess the impact of transgender individuals serving in the military.", "The delay in the start date for accepting transgender service members until January 1": "2018, announced by Defense Secretary James Mattis on June 30. Mattis stated that this additional time would be used to evaluate the impact of such accessions on readiness and lethality, indicating a thorough review process was being conducted. However, President Trump announced the policy change before the end of the six-month review period, contradicting the planned evaluation."}
