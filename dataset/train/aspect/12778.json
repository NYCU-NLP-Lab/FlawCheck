This translation further supports the claim being false.", "A screenshot of the original Facebook post showing the manipulated image was included": "allowing for a visual comparison between the doctored image and the original photo.", "Evidence was presented that Modi had visited Kedarnath in May 2019": "dressed as a monk, which establishes the context for the manipulated image.
