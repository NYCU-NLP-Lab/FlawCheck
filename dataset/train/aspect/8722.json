{"The claim suggests that pandemics occur every 100 years": "with specific examples given for 1720, 1820, 1920, and 2020. However, the expert's verdict states that there was no pandemic in 1720 and that the years listed for the next two pandemics are incorrect.", "The expert also points out that many more pandemics have occurred outside of the neat 100": "year timeline mentioned in the claim. This challenges the idea that pandemics occur with synchronicity every century.", "The definition of a pandemic provided by the World Health Organization and the U": "S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention contradicts the claim's assertion that pandemics only occur every 100 years. According to these definitions, a pandemic is a global outbreak of disease that can happen when a new virus emerges and spreads sustainably between people.", "The expert mentions several other pandemics that occurred outside of the claimed 100": "year cycle, such as the Great Plague of London in 1665, yellow fever in the late 1800s, the H2N2/Asian flu in 1957-1958, the H3N2 flu virus in 1968, and the H1N1/swine flu in 2009. These examples further undermine the claim's assertion of a precise 100-year pattern for pandemics."}
