{"The claim was verified by examining the history of online naming fiascos": "such as the infamous \"Boaty McBoatface\" incident, which suggests that it is not implausible for the United States Navy to name a ship in a similar manner.", "The authenticity of the claim was questioned based on the source of the information": "which was a well-known military satire website called Duffel Blog. The website clearly states that all of its content is fictitious, indicating that the claim is not genuine.", "A fake tweet purporting to show President Donald Trump expressing his support for the ship": "s name was identified, further discrediting the claim. It was confirmed that the tweet was not genuine and did not come from President Trump or the US Navy.", "The concept of a spoonerism": "a word play that swaps the first letters of two words, was explained in relation to the fictitious ship's name \"USS Tig Ol Bitties.\" This linguistic technique was attributed to William Archibald Spooner, a historical figure known for his wordplay, adding further evidence that the claim is not authentic."}
