{"The fire marshal": "s political affiliation: The expert's research shows that the fire marshal, Lacey, is actually a registered Republican, contradicting Trump's claim that he is a Democrat.", "Compliance with safety requirements": "The Trump campaign had agreed to comply with the fire department's safety requirements days before the rally, indicating that the fire marshal's decision on crowd restrictions was based on standard guidelines.", "Collaboration with other officials": "Lacey worked closely with the Secret Service, police, and UCCS officials to determine the appropriate \"occupant loads\" for the venues. This suggests that the fire marshal's decision was not made solely by himself but in consultation with other experts.", "Safety concerns and fire code guidelines": "The fire code, which most fire agencies rely on, is based on ensuring the safety of occupants by providing a proper number of exits based on the square footage and number of people. The fire marshal's decision to restrict the crowd size was in line with these guidelines, as overcrowding and blocked exits can contribute to tragic indoor fires."}
