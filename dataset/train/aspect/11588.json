{"The claim originated from a website known for publishing fabricated stories and engaging in political trolling under the guise of satire": "The website, Daily World Update, has a disclaimer stating that everything on their site is fiction.", "The expert": "s verdict mentioned that the website Snopes.com, founded by David Mikkelson, provided additional information and analysis to debunk the false claim. Snopes.com is a reputable fact-checking website known for verifying the accuracy of various claims and debunking misinformation.", "The expert also pointed out that the claim contradicted itself": "as the same website reported that Hillary Clinton had been killed in a different manner and in a different place on the same day. This inconsistency further undermined the authenticity of the claim."}
