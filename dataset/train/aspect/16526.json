{"The claim made by Shelley Adler that Rep": "Jon Runyan \"voted to redefine rape\" is being examined for its authenticity.", "The claim is based on legislation sponsored by Rep": "Chris Smith called the \"No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act,\" which originally included the term \"forcible rape\" in its restrictions on federal funding for abortions.", "PolitiFact Wisconsin previously checked a similar claim made by Rep": "Gwen Moore that House Republicans \"tried to change the definition of rape\" and rated it as Mostly False. They found that the intention was to limit federal funding for abortions, not to change the definition of rape.", "When Rep": "Jon Runyan voted in favor of Smith's bill, the term \"forcible\" had already been removed, making Adler's claim that he voted to redefine rape inaccurate."}
