{"Rick Scott signed legislation in 2011 that required all women to receive an ultrasound before undergoing an abortion": "This law also mandated that women have the opportunity to review the ultrasound and have it explained to them, although they could decline to do so by signing a form.", "Previously": "Florida law only required ultrasounds prior to second trimester or later abortions, but many clinics still performed them for first trimester abortions. The law signed by Scott in 2011 expanded the ultrasound requirement to include first trimester abortions.", "In 2014": "Scott signed HB 1047, which changed the timeline for cutting off abortions. This law banned abortions once a fetus is considered viable, typically around 23 or 24 weeks of gestation.", "The ad claims that Scott signed laws restricting access to abortion even in cases of rape or incest": "While the expert's verdict states that the claim was largely correct, it does not provide specific details about the laws that were signed in this regard."}
