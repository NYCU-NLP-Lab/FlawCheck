The asteroid's orbit around the sun keeps it as a constant companion of Earth, but it is too distant to be considered a true satellite.", "The asteroid": "s orbit is highly irregular and circuitous, causing it to fall behind and pass ahead of Earth in a game of leapfrog.", "Although the asteroid has been trapped in a dance with Earth for around a million years": "its presence in our orbit is likely temporary and it is unlikely to remain a permanent fixture."}
