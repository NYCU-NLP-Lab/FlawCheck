{"Historical inaccuracy": "The expert points out that former President George W. Bush was in office during the September 11, 2001 attacks, not Donald Trump. This highlights the historical inaccuracy of the claim.", "Doctored image of Obama": "The expert explains that the image of Barack Obama in the Facebook post has been doctored to make it appear as if he is watching a basketball game. The original photo actually shows Obama in a meeting with his national security adviser and other officials.", "Doctored image of Trump": "The expert reveals that the image of Donald Trump in the Facebook post has been edited into a photo taken by a Reuters photographer. This suggests that Trump was not actually present at the World Trade Center site on September 11, 2001.", "Lack of evidence": "The expert cites Richard Alles, a New York Department battalion chief on September 11, who states that he has no knowledge of Trump being at the site or sending workers to help. This lack of evidence undermines the authenticity of the claim."}
