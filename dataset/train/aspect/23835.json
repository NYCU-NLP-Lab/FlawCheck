{"The claim is supported by evidence from previous research articles and surveys that have found a correlation between a mother": "s education and lower child mortality rates.", "The expert notes that the claim has been modified from focusing solely on infant mortality to including child mortality as well": "This distinction is important because the research on the link between a mother's education and child health primarily looks at child mortality rates, not just infant mortality rates.", "The expert mentions that the difference between infant and child mortality rates can vary in different countries": "For example, in countries such as India, the child mortality rate has consistently declined while the infant mortality rate has remained relatively the same over time. This implies that the impact of maternal education on child health may differ depending on the specific country and its healthcare system.", "The expert also highlights that while maternal education can improve the odds of better health outcomes for both infants and older children": "the decisions and actions of the mother have a greater impact on the health of older children. This includes factors such as ensuring vaccinations and recognizing the dangers of certain illnesses like diarrhea."}
