{"Lack of legitimate news articles": "The expert found no legitimate news articles stating that a sunken Nazi submarine was recently discovered in the Great Lakes. This lack of credible sources raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Unrelated photo": "The story included a photo of a rusted submarine, which was later found to be an unrelated image of a decommissioned Russian submarine from the Cold War era. This discrepancy suggests that the photo used to support the claim was misleading and not related to the alleged discovery.", "False quote from a non": "existent professor: The story quoted Mark Carpenter, a supposed professor at Niagara University. However, the university's spokesman confirmed that they do not have a professor by that name. This false attribution of a quote undermines the credibility of the claim.", "Contradiction from the Coast Guard": "The Coast Guard stated that the story of a recent discovery of a Nazi submarine in the Great Lakes is false. While they acknowledged the existence of a sunken WWII submarine in the Great Lakes, they clarified that the Coast Guard did not work with Niagara University to recover a sunken WWII German submarine. This contradiction from an authoritative source further discredits the claim."}
