{"Statistical patterns and consultation with experts": "The expert's verdict mentions that the evidence linking DACA to the surge of minors at the southern border is weak, based on statistical patterns and consultation with experts. This suggests that the expert considered data and expert opinions to assess the claim's authenticity.", "Lack of logical or empirical linkage": "The expert quotes Douglas Massey, a Princeton University sociologist, who states that there is no logical or empirical linkage between DACA and the child migrants from Central America. This indicates that the expert considered the lack of a logical or empirical connection as a factor in evaluating the claim.", "Residency requirement under DACA": "The expert points out that the residency requirement under DACA meant that none of the unaccompanied minors arriving at the southern border in 2014 would have qualified for DACA. This highlights a specific aspect of DACA that contradicts the claim, providing evidence against its authenticity.", "Reports and leaked memo": "The expert refers to an article published in the Washington Post and a leaked memo written by Border Patrol agents. These sources provide additional information that supports the argument against the claim. The article mentions Senator Dianne Feinstein's observations about the motivations of the minors crossing the border, while the leaked memo contains interviews with migrants from Central America, further undermining the claim."}
