{"Comparison of photographs": "The expert compared the photographs circulating on social media with the description of the helicopter crash involving Ruto's pilot. They found that the photographs showed different helicopters, indicating that at least two of the posts were misleading.", "Reverse image search": "The expert conducted a reverse image search on Google to determine the origin of one of the photographs. They found that it was first posted online in October 2018, depicting a helicopter crash in Delaware, United States. This helped establish that the image was not related to the Kenya helicopter crash.", "Social media posts": "The expert analyzed the posts on Facebook and Twitter where the photographs were shared. They observed that none of the posts indicated that the images were from previous accidents, potentially misleading readers into assuming they were related to the recent Kenya helicopter crash.", "User comments": "The expert took note of the comments on one of the tweets, where some users correctly identified the image as an old one. This further supported the conclusion that the photographs shared on social media were not authentic and were being misrepresented."}
