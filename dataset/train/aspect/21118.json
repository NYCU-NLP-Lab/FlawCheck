{"The Fox": "Friends segment: The expert's verdict mentions a segment on Fox & Friends where a video clip from a website called SourceFed was shown. This segment highlighted the differences in autocomplete predictions for searching \"Hillary Clinton cri\" on Google, Yahoo, and Bing. This segment serves as evidence to support the claim that Google may be filtering out certain terms related to Hillary Clinton's alleged crimes or criminal activity.", "SourceFed video": "The expert's verdict mentions a video posted by SourceFed on YouTube that demonstrates how certain terms, when searched with Clinton's name, do not autocomplete as suggestions underneath the search bar. This video provides visual evidence to support the claim that Google's autocomplete feature may be biased in favor of Hillary Clinton by not suggesting terms related to her alleged crimes.", "Google": "s denial and explanation: The expert's verdict mentions that Google denied the accusation of manipulating autocomplete in favor of Hillary Clinton. A Google spokesperson stated that the autocomplete algorithm is designed to avoid completing a search for a person's name with offensive or disparaging terms. This statement from Google serves as evidence to counter the claim and suggests that the filtering of certain terms is not specific to Hillary Clinton but applies to all individuals.", "Testing Vox": "s theory: The expert's verdict mentions that the authenticity of the claim was tested by searching for other individuals, such as Casey Anthony and George Zimmerman, who were suspects in criminal murder investigations but were acquitted. The autocomplete feature did not yield any suggestions for these individuals, supporting Vox's theory that autocomplete does not predict terms related to individuals accused but not convicted of crimes. This testing provides additional evidence to refute the claim that Google is intentionally favoring Hillary Clinton by filtering out certain terms."}
