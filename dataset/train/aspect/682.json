{"The claim states that": "COVID literally stands for Chinese Originated Viral Infectious Disease and the number 19 is due to this being the 19th virus to come out of China.\" This aspect of the claim is being used to support the idea that the term \"Chinese Virus\" is closer to the truth than news reports suggest.", "The expert": "s verdict concludes by rating the Facebook post as \"Pants on Fire,\" indicating that the claim is completely false. This suggests that the authenticity of the claim has been thoroughly examined and debunked.", "The CDC states that COVID": "19 is an abbreviation of \"coronavirus disease 2019,\" with \"CO\" representing \"corona,\" \"VI\" representing \"virus,\" and \"D\" representing \"disease.\" This contradicts the claim's interpretation of COVID as an acronym for \"Chinese Originated Viral Infectious Disease.\""}
