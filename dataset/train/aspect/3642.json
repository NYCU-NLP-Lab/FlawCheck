{"Source of the claim": "The expert investigated the source of the claim, which was a Facebook post created by a website called Occupy*Posters. The website provides memes for supporters of the Occupy Wall Street movement to share on social media.", "Verification of the claim": "The expert found a fact sheet from the National Coalition Against Homelessness that was cited in the meme. The fact sheet stated that \"44% of homeless people ... have jobs and can't escape homelessness.\" However, the original source of this statistic was not provided, and the advocacy group did not respond to an inquiry.", "Age of the data": "The expert noted that the data used to support the claim was from a report published in 1999, with data collected in 1996. This makes the statistics nearly 18 years old, which is considered outdated by social-science standards.", "Lack of more recent data": "The expert consulted other experts in the field who confirmed that there are no more recent statistics available to address the question of how many homeless people are employed. This highlights the difficulty in obtaining up-to-date data on this topic."}
