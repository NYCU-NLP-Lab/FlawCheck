{"The claim is supported by multiple sources": "including campaign ads, a campaign website, and a KATU questionnaire, all of which mention the negotiation with teachers to work for free in order to save the school year during a budget crisis in Salem.", "The claim is contradicted by the statement of Ann Nice": "former president of the Portland Association of Teachers, who states that there has only been one instance in history when teachers worked for free, and that was in 2003 when Charlie Hales was no longer on council. This contradicts Hales' claim of negotiating with teachers to work for free.", "The claim is further supported by evidence that in February 2003": "the county, city, teachers' union, and district agreed to a contract that preserved the school days, with teachers agreeing to work 10 days without compensation. This aligns with Hales' claim of negotiating with teachers to work half the days for free.", "Hales": "departure from the council in June 2002 to take a job in the private sector raises questions about his involvement in the negotiations that took place in 2003. It suggests that he may not have been directly involved in the negotiations and raises doubts about his claim of playing a significant role in saving the school year."}
