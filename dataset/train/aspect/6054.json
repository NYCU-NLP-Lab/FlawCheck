{"The claim specifically refers to a medical marijuana law in the state of Oklahoma": "2. The law changes nothing for people who are not in Oklahoma and/or who do not have a valid medical-marijuana license.", "The claim that THC will be removed from drug": "test screenings starting August 30th only applies to residents of Oklahoma with valid medical-marijuana licenses.", "The claim was based on a screenshot from a local news broadcast": "which spread across the internet without providing the necessary context, leading to misunderstandings and false assumptions."}
