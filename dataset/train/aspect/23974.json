{"The claim is based on a flawed understanding of the difference between estrogen and phytoestrogens": "The expert explains that Impossible Burgers, which use soy as their protein, do not contain estrogen but rather phytoestrogens, which are structurally similar but have different effects on hormonally mediated processes.", "The expert highlights that phytoestrogens have a much less pronounced effect on the human body compared to actual estrogens": "Therefore, the comparison made by the claim between the \"estrogen\" levels in Impossible Whoppers and birth control pills, which contain synthetic estrogen compounds, is problematic.", "The relationship between phytoestrogens and estrogens is not simple or linear": "The expert explains that the way phytoestrogens act on the human body depends on various factors, including the amount of estrogen already present in the body. Phytoestrogens also interact with different receptors and have different effects on estrogen-controlled processes.", "The claim": "s assertion that soy-based products can lead to the development of female secondary sexual characteristics in males is based on a single 2008 case study, which is insufficient evidence to support such a broad claim. The expert suggests that more comprehensive and rigorous research is needed to draw any definitive conclusions."}
