{"Lack of credible sources": "The expert's verdict highlights that there are no credible news stories or reports covering the claim of people handing out masks doused with chemicals to rob individuals. This lack of reliable sources raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Inconsistent warnings": "The cautionary tale mentioned in the expert's verdict is similar to other debunked claims, such as individuals pretending to be from the Census or COVID-19 testers to rob people. This inconsistency in the nature of the warnings suggests a pattern of false information circulating rather than an actual threat.", "Unresponsive authorities": "The post claims that it came from someone connected to \"Chesapeake Law Enforcement,\" but the police department in Chesapeake, Virginia, did not respond to inquiries about the post. This lack of response from relevant authorities raises questions about the credibility of the claim.", "Global spread without evidence": "The unfounded warning about thieves handing out compromised masks has spread globally, but Reuters, which fact-checked similar posts, found no evidence to support these claims. The global spread of the warning without any substantiating evidence further undermines its authenticity."}
