{"Multiple sources confirm that David Hogg": "a survivor of the Parkland school shooting, was present at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School during the shooting. This includes footage from the \"39 Days\" documentary produced by CBS News, where Hogg describes his immediate actions following the shooting.", "False claims suggesting that Hogg was not at school during the shooting were spread by internet bloggers": "These claims were based on a misinterpretation of a soundbite from the CBS documentary, where Hogg mentions riding his bike to the school after hearing about the shooting.", "The blogs failed to acknowledge that Hogg initially took cover in a classroom closet during the shooting and later returned to the school to conduct interviews": "This timeline was confirmed by Hogg himself and other sources, such as Vox.", "The blogs also did not consider the possibility that Hogg": "s actions of leaving the school and returning could have occurred after the initial lockdown was lifted or during a period when he believed it was safe to do so. The blogs did not provide any evidence to support their claim that Hogg's actions were contradictory or impossible."}
