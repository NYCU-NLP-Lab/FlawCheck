{"Lack of photographic evidence": "The expert notes that the claim is based on a photograph, but states that the image does not actually depict Joe Biden's great-grandfather. This suggests that there is no authentic photographic evidence to support the claim.", "Historical research": "The expert mentions that they conducted research on Biden's family tree and found no mention of a great-grandfather named Joseph J. Biden. They also cite the Irish Family History Research Center, which traced Biden's Irish ancestry back six generations and identified different great-grandfathers for him. This historical research contradicts the claim that Joseph J. Biden was a Confederate soldier who owned slaves.", "Lack of supporting information": "The expert highlights that the meme claiming Biden's great-grandfather's Confederate ties has been circulating for over a decade, but no sources or supporting information have emerged to validate the claim. This lack of supporting evidence further undermines the authenticity of the claim.", "Expert genealogist findings": "The expert references genealogist Megan Smolenyak, who conducted previous research on Biden's family history. Smolenyak's findings align with the Irish Family History Research Center's information, identifying different ancestors for Biden. This expert genealogist's research provides additional credibility to the conclusion that the claim is not authentic."}
