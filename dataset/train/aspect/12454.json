{"The claim is supported by a study conducted by Steven Camarota at the Center for Immigration Studies": "a think tank that favors low-immigration levels. The study used data from the Census Bureau's Survey of Income and Program Participation to determine the percentage of immigrant-headed households receiving government assistance programs.", "The study found that in 2012": "51 percent of immigrant-headed households (living here legally or illegally) reported using at least one welfare program during the year, compared to 30 percent of native-born households. This data provides evidence to support the claim that a significant share of immigrants receive benefits from the social welfare system.", "The study considered various government assistance programs": "including Supplemental Security Income (SSI), Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), Women, Infants, and Children food program (WIC), free or subsidized school lunches, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Medicaid, and public housing and rent subsidies. By factoring in these programs, the study provides a comprehensive assessment of the welfare utilization among immigrant households.", "The study also acknowledges that the 1996 law restricting immigrants from public benefits during their first five years as a": "qualified alien\" has only a modest impact on the share of immigrant households receiving welfare. This suggests that the majority of authorized immigrants have been in the country for more than five years and are eligible for government assistance programs."}
