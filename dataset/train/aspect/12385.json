{"The statement made by Don Willett": "a Texas Supreme Court justice, was considered to be mostly true by the expert, indicating that there is some validity to the claim.", "The expert analyzed a report issued by the American Council of Trustees and Alumni": "an independent group committed to academic freedom and accountability in colleges and universities. The report stated that 70% of the top-ranked U.S. colleges and universities do not require history majors to take courses in American history.", "The report also highlighted that among the institutions that do require a course in American history": "some offer courses with narrow scopes, such as \"History of Sexualities\" or \"History of the FBI,\" which may not adequately fulfill the requirement.", "The expert noted that Rice University": "which previously required history majors to take a U.S. history course, has made it optional in their new set of requirements. This example further supports the claim that there is a trend among elite universities to no longer require history majors to study American history."}
