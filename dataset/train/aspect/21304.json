{"Different assumptions in research calculations": "One aspect employed to verify the authenticity of the claim is the fact that estimates of the temperature reduction under the Paris Agreement differ because researchers make different assumptions at the onset of their calculations. This means that different studies may show greater or lesser reductions depending on the assumptions made.", "Ambitious pledges by countries": "Another aspect is the consideration of whether countries will make more ambitious pledges to reduce carbon emissions in the future. The Paris Agreement expects countries to submit new pledges every five years, and these pledges should grow more ambitious over time. The level of ambition in these pledges can impact the estimated temperature reduction.", "Previous global warming levels": "The fact that the planet has already warmed nearly 1 degree Celsius above pre-industrial levels, according to NASA, is another aspect considered. This implies that any temperature reduction achieved through the Paris Agreement would be in addition to the existing warming.", "Supportive research and expert opinions": "The use of research and expert opinions is also employed to verify the claim. The White House cited research from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to support the claim that the impact of the Paris Agreement on the climate would be negligible. However, former Vice President Al Gore disputed this claim and stated that the agreement gives tremendous momentum to reducing global warming."}
