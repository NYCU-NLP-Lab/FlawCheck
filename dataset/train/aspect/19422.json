{"The claim was spread through a viral image on social media that falsely attributed a quote to U": "S. Rep. Nancy Pelosi.", "The context and timing of when Pelosi may have made the alleged statement were not provided": "and no evidence could be found to support the claim.", "The misquote was traced back to a 2013 interview Pelosi had with Candy Crowley on CNN": "where she was discussing concerns about the Affordable Care Act and its impact on the 40-hour work week.", "The misquote distorted the entire context of the conversation": "as Pelosi was actually addressing issues related to multiemployer plans and bargaining rights, not expressing support for employers cutting hours."}
