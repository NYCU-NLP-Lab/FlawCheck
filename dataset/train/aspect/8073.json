{"Lack of evidence": "The expert's verdict states that there is no evidence to support the claim that Walmart has authorized law enforcement to arrest illegal immigrants within its stores. This lack of evidence casts doubt on the authenticity of the claim.", "Walmart": "s denial: Walmart itself has denied the claim and stated that the rumors are baseless and inaccurate. This denial adds to the skepticism surrounding the claim.", "Concerns from Hispanic groups": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim is tied to efforts by Latino groups to organize a boycott of Walmart for a month. This suggests that the claim may be a tactic used to promote the boycott, raising questions about its authenticity.", "Inability to confirm accounts": "The San Diego Immigrant Rights Consortium (SDIRC) mentioned in the expert's verdict has not been able to confirm any accounts of the apprehension of illegal immigrants at Walmart stores. This further undermines the credibility of the claim."}
