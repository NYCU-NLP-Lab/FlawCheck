{"The claim is supported by data from the federally sponsored National Survey on Drug Use and Health": "which estimated that 22.7 million Americans needed treatment for a drug or alcohol problem.", "The claim is consistent with prior findings and estimates from the survey": "indicating that the ratio of Americans needing treatment to those receiving treatment at a specialty facility is approximately 1 in 9.", "The term": "specialty facility\" is defined as treatment received at drug or alcohol rehabilitation facilities, hospitals (inpatient services only), and mental health centers, excluding treatment received in other settings such as emergency rooms, private doctor's offices, self-help groups, prisons or jails, or hospitals as an outpatient.", "While the claim does not specifically mention Alcoholics Anonymous": "AA), it is noted that AA is not counted as a specialty facility treatment in the survey. However, AA has a significant number of participants in the United States, with 1,283,704 members as of Jan. 1, 2015, indicating that additional individuals may be seeking treatment through alternative means."}
