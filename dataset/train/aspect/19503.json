{"The Oregon Department of Education": "ODE) promoted an independent project that claimed \"White supremacy culture shows up in math classrooms when ... students are required to 'show their work'.\" This statement was found in materials on the project's website, which were linked to in a newsletter to math teachers.", "The ODE clarified that they did not explicitly state that requiring students to": "show their work\" in math class was a form of white supremacy. Instead, they explained that expanding the ways in which teachers make students explain their question-answering process beyond the written word and numbers could help eliminate racial and language performance gaps.", "Online reports and articles from conservative media outlets": "such as The Daily Wire and Fox News, circulated the claim that the ODE said asking students to show their work perpetuated white supremacism. These reports sparked debates on social media platforms like Twitter and Reddit regarding the accuracy of the allegations.", "The source of the rumor was a newsletter from ODE to math teachers that included links to additional teaching resources": "This newsletter promoted a virtual learning seminar created by an outside entity called Pathway to Equitable Math Instruction, which aimed to address performance gaps between white and English-speaking students and other students. The authenticity of the newsletter was confirmed by ODE's Director of Communications."}
