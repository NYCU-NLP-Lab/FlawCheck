The expert noted that seniors tend to vote at a higher rate compared to Hispanics. In the 2010 elections, about 61 percent of seniors voted, while the Hispanic rate was only 31 percent.", "Influence of age and ethnicity": "The expert discussed the assumption made by Brit Hume that age, rather than ethnicity, plays a more significant role in shaping a person's vote.
