{"The claim is made by Rudy Moise": "a Democrat running for Congress in South Florida, who cites troubling statistics on his campaign website to support his claim about the high school dropout rate in his district.", "Moise": "s campaign points to a report by the Schott Foundation about black males and education for 2007-2008, which shows graduation rates for black males in Miami-Dade, Broward, and Florida. They subtracted these rates from 100 to calculate the dropout rate.", "The dropout rate mentioned in the claim specifically refers to black males compared to white males": "as indicated by the report provided by Moise's campaign. This suggests that the claim focuses on a specific demographic within the district.", "The expert notes that while the math used by Moise": "s campaign to calculate the dropout rate is valid, some educational experts argue that the dropout rate isn't simply the inverse of the graduation rate, indicating a potential limitation in the methodology used."}
