{"The claim originated from a publication called The Free Thought Project": "which also published an article stating that it was illegal for Flint homeowners to sell their properties due to the water crisis.", "The claim was further supported by a statement made by a Flint resident in a Russia Today video clip": "where the resident mentioned that it was illegal to sell homes with a known copper and lead problem.", "Flint resident Melissa Mays also repeated the claim in a Huffington Post article": "stating that it is illegal to sell homes with a known copper and lead problem and that residents have no options to move.", "In order to verify the claim": "relevant state agencies in Michigan were contacted, as well as local real estate businesses such as Coldwell Banker and Century 21 in Flint. Both representatives from these businesses stated that they were not aware of any regulation or legal restriction on selling homes in Flint, and property sales have not been affected by any such restriction."}
