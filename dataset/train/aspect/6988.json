{"The claim is made by Charlie Crist during the second governor": "s debate at Broward College, where he states that Medicaid expansion in Florida would create about 120,000 jobs.", "Medicaid is a joint state and federal program aimed at providing health insurance to the very poor": "The 2010 Affordable Care Act encourages states to expand eligibility, with the federal government paying a significant portion of the expansion costs. The expansion would have led to a significant increase in the number of Floridians signing up for Medicaid.", "Studies predicting job growth are based on the assumption that as states expand Medicaid": "new patients will access medical services they haven't used in the past. This increased demand for medical services would result in additional revenue for healthcare facilities, allowing them to hire new workers.", "Different economic models and assumptions used in various studies lead to significant differences in job predictions": "For example, Moody's predicted Medicaid expansion would create 10,000 to 30,000 jobs over 10 years in Florida, while the White House Council of Economic Advisers projected 63,800 jobs between 2014 and 2017. These variations highlight the complexity and uncertainty in estimating the exact number of jobs that would be created."}
