{"Spelling and grammatical errors": "The tweet in question contains multiple spelling mistakes, including misspelling 'Ethiopian' as 'Etiopian' and 'extremist' as 'extrimist'. This inconsistency raises doubts about its authenticity.", "Font and formatting inconsistencies": "The tweet does not use the standard font used by Twitter, and the date on the tweet appears to be crudely pasted on in the wrong font. Additionally, the positioning of the date in relation to other elements in the screenshot is unusual, indicating potential tampering.", "Lack of evidence on official Twitter account": "A search on Twitter using the US President's official account (@realDonaldTrump) reveals no mention of the words 'Ethiopian community' or any condemnation of killings in Ethiopia on the specified date. This absence of evidence casts doubt on the authenticity of the claim.", "Forensic analysis and previous cases of fake Trump tweets": "The use of forensic analysis tools, such as InVID, reveals inconsistencies in the screenshot, suggesting manipulation. Additionally, the fact that AFP has previously reported on fake Trump tweets and the existence of websites allowing the creation of fabricated tweets highlights the prevalence of misinformation through fake posts."}
