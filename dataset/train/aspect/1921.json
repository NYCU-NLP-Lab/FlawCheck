{"Lack of official data": "The expert mentions that there is no official state office that collects the ethnicity of registered voters in Nevada, making it difficult to verify the claim accurately.", "Use of exit polls": "The expert refers to aging exit polls from previous elections as the main source of information on demographic turnout in Nevada. However, these polls may not accurately reflect the current population composition.", "Comparison to 2008 caucus": "The expert mentions that the only valid comparison available is the 2008 caucus, where white voters made up around 65 percent of the vote. This suggests that the claim of Nevada being \"80 percent white voters\" is questionable.", "Demographic trends": "The expert states that demographic trends in Nevada do not seem to support the claim made by the Clinton campaign. There is no indication of a massive growth in white voter turnout that would result in an 80 percent white voter composition."}
