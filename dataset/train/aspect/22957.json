{"The financial disclosure form was not leaked": "but rather available upon request from Scaramucci's former employer, the Export-Import Bank.", "Scaramucci": "s claim that the leak was a felony is incorrect, as criminal statutes only apply to the leaking of nonpublic national security information or theft of government property.", "The financial disclosure form was not relevant to national security": "making it unlikely to be subject to criminal statutes.", "There are no specific statutes that criminalize the disclosure of financial disclosure forms": "unlike tax returns which are protected by specific laws."}
