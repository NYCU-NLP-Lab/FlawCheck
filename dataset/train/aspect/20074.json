{"The bug that caused Siri to dial emergency services when prompted with phrases such as": "charge my phone to 100 percent\" was reportedly fixed within a day of its widespread notice. This suggests that the claim may have been based on a previous glitch that has since been resolved.", "Telling Siri": "charge my phone to 100 percent\" will not result in any action other than receiving an apologetic response from Siri stating that the request is not within her abilities. This indicates that the claim is false and that Siri does not have the capability to dial emergency services in this manner.", "The claim aligns with a common theme in crime and safety urban legends": "which often involve little-known tricks or codes that supposedly enable victims to secretly contact help. However, these urban legends are often unfounded and play on our fears of being in situations where we need help but cannot access it easily.", "Multiple attempts were made to verify the claim by asking Siri to charge the phone to 100 percent": "but Siri only responded with an apology for being unable to comply. This further confirms that the claim is not true and that Siri does not initiate dialing emergency services in this manner."}
