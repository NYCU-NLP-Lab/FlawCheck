{"The headline of the claim is analyzed to determine if it accurately reflects the content of the article linked to it": "In this case, the primary article does not support the claim's headline.", "The source of the claim": "the New Century Times, is evaluated to determine its credibility and reliability. It is noted that the author of the article is also associated with a satirical website, but there is no reason to believe that the Social Security article is intended as satire.", "The analysis includes a review of the column by Josh Marshall": "the editor and publisher of Talking Points Memo, which is linked to by the New Century Times. It is found that Marshall's column does not state that the cuts will be \"50 percent immediately,\" and the New Century Times article does not provide any other evidence to support this claim.", "A separate quote from House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is examined": "which states that the Johnson bill \"cuts benefits by more than a third\" and not 50 percent. This discrepancy raises further doubts about the accuracy of the claim."}
