{"The expert analyzed data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics for private": "sector employment to measure the change between December and June of every year since 1999. This data was used to verify the claim made by President Obama about the private-sector jobs growth in 2013.", "The expert compared the change in private": "sector jobs for 2013 with the changes in previous years, specifically noting that the total for 2013 was indeed the highest since 1999. This comparison was used to support the authenticity of the claim.", "The expert also highlighted the margin of sampling error in the employment statistics released by the BLS": "They explained that the standard margin of error for a six-month comparison of this sort is 106,370 jobs on either side. This information was provided to give context to the comparison made by President Obama and to acknowledge the potential range of variation in the data.", "The expert noted that while the gain in private": "sector jobs in 2013 was the highest since 1999, there were other years (2012, 2011, and 2005) that produced job increases very close to the gain in 2013. This information was presented to emphasize that the claim made by President Obama was technically too close to call in terms of which six-month period created the biggest gain in private-sector jobs."}
