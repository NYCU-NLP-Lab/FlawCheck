{"Confirmation from the Alabama Department of Public Health": "The Alabama Department of Public Health stated in a December 16 statement that no recipients of the Pfizer coronavirus vaccine had died. They reached out to all hospitals in the state that administered the vaccine and confirmed that there have been no deaths of vaccine recipients. This official confirmation adds credibility to the claim's inauthenticity.", "Lack of evidence linking Pfizer vaccine to deaths": "The expert mentions that there is no evidence to support the claim that a nurse died after receiving the Pfizer vaccine. They state that other fact-checkers have debunked similar rumors of nurses dying after taking the vaccine. This lack of evidence further supports the conclusion that the claim is not authentic.", "Reputable sources debunking the claim": "The expert refers to the New York Times, which reported that two healthcare workers in Alaska developed allergic reactions after receiving the vaccine but were treated at the hospital where they worked. However, there is no evidence linking the Pfizer vaccine to deaths since it was first distributed to healthcare workers. The inclusion of reputable sources debunking the claim strengthens the argument against its authenticity.", "FDA": "s stance on the vaccine's safety: The expert mentions that the FDA has not found any reason to believe that the Pfizer vaccine could cause death. This indicates that the regulatory authority responsible for approving the vaccine has not identified any safety concerns that would support the claim. The FDA's position further discredits the authenticity of the claim."}
