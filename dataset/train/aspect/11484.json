{"Lack of historical documentation": "The expert mentions that early historians of the Capitol's construction did not pay much attention to the work of common laborers, including both paid and slave workers. The historical records from that time are also noted to be incomplete.", "Personal interest": "driven research: The investigation into the role of slaves in constructing the Capitol was initially led by individuals who developed a personal interest in the subject, such as retired Washington television reporter Ed Hotaling and freelance writer Bob Arnebeck. This indicates that the research was not initially conducted by professional historians.", "Task force report": "In 2005, Congress appointed a task force to research the subject of slave laborers in the construction of the United States Capitol. The task force, in collaboration with the Office of the Architect of the Capitol, issued a report that brought scholarly rigor to the topic. However, the report acknowledged that it was not able to provide a complete account of the number of slaves involved in the construction.", "Evidence from payment records": "The task force found compelling evidence of slave involvement in the Capitol's construction through records of payments made by the commissioners for the District of Columbia to slave laborers. These payments indicate that slaves were indeed employed in the construction process."}
