{"The claim is based on a tweet by U": "S. President Donald Trump suggesting the delay of the November 2020 election due to concerns about mail-in ballots.", "The Constitution grants Congress": "not the president, the power to set the election date, making it highly unlikely for the general election to be postponed.", "Even if the election were delayed": "it does not mean that Trump would remain in office beyond his term, as the Constitution requires the sitting president to vacate office on January 20.", "The line of succession after the president and vice president includes the Speaker of the House": "Nancy Pelosi, but delaying the election would not automatically result in her assuming the office of president. The Senate president pro-tempore would also be in line for succession, and the majority of senators up for reelection in 2020 are Democrats."}
