{"Little change in spending": "The expert's verdict states that there has been little change in spending on the inner cities so far, contradicting Trump's claim that his administration is \"spending a lot of money on the inner cities.\"", "Proposed budget cuts": "Trump's proposed 2018 budget includes a 13 percent cut to the Housing and Urban Development budget, which would eliminate the Community Development Block Grant program. This contradicts Trump's claim of increased spending on the inner cities.", "Shifted resources towards crime reduction": "While Trump has shifted some existing resources towards reducing violent crime in cities, the expert highlights that the reductions to other programs that benefit cities are much deeper. This suggests that the overall impact on the inner cities may not be as significant as claimed.", "Lack of new initiatives or investments": "The expert mentions that there is no discussion in the White House about new initiatives, programs, or investments in the inner cities. This contradicts Trump's claim of doing \"far more than anybody's done\" for the inner cities. Additionally, the proposed budget cuts to agencies impacting urban areas further undermine the claim of increased spending."}
