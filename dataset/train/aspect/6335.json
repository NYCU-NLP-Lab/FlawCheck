{"Comparison of state tax collections": "The expert compared the state tax collections of New York and Florida in 2010. New York's state taxes were $63.5 billion, while Florida's state collections were $31.5 billion, indicating a significant disparity.", "Calculation of tax burden per citizen": "The expert calculated the tax burden per citizen by dividing the total tax collections by the population. In 2010, New York's tax burden per citizen was $3,278, while Florida's was $1,675, showing that New York's tax burden per citizen was almost double that of Florida.", "Consideration of local taxes": "The expert highlighted the importance of considering local taxes in the analysis. Florida has a higher reliance on local taxes, including property taxes, which are not factored into the comparison. Taking local taxes into account, New York's tax collections would be about 90 percent more than Florida's, not 97 percent.", "Alternative measures of tax burden": "The expert discussed different ways economists measure tax burden, including the per capita method used by the claim. However, other measures, such as the portion of income that goes towards taxes, show a smaller disparity between the two states. In 2009, the tax burden rate was 9.3 percent in Florida and 14.3 percent in New York."}
