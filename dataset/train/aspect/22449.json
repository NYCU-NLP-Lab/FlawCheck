House of Representatives' passage: The expert confirms that universal basic income legislation did pass the U.S. House of Representatives twice in 1971, supporting Andrew Yang's claim.", "Broad correctness but lack of precision": "The expert concludes that while Andrew Yang's comparisons to Thomas Paine, Martin Luther King Jr., and 1970s legislation are broadly correct, they are not entirely precise.
