{"Steve Poizner": "s past stance on immigration: The expert's verdict mentions that Steve Poizner, the subject of the claim, had taken several hard-line stances on immigration during his 2010 run for governor. This provides context to the claim and suggests that there may be some truth to it.", "Poizner": "s recent change in stance: The expert's verdict highlights that Poizner has changed some of his positions on immigration, including his belief that everyone who is undocumented should be put on a path to get documented and that young people in the DACA program should be eligible for U.S. citizenship. This suggests that Poizner's past stance on blocking immigrant children from getting MediCal health insurance may no longer be valid.", "Lack of specific mention of health benefits in previous campaign ad": "The expert's verdict notes that in Poizner's 2010 campaign ad, he made a blanket pledge to stop all benefits for undocumented Californians, but did not specifically bring up health benefits. This implies that the claim may be an extrapolation or interpretation of Poizner's previous stance rather than a direct statement.", "Lack of response from Poizner": "s campaign: The expert's verdict mentions that Poizner's campaign did not respond to requests for clarification on where he currently stands on the specific issue of providing health insurance to immigrant children. This lack of response raises questions about Poizner's current position and adds uncertainty to the authenticity of the claim."}
