{"The timeline of events": "The expert's verdict examines the claim that a small group of angry black students forced the resignation of the two highest-ranking officials at the school within a period of roughly 72 hours. The expert analyzes the timeline of events leading up to the resignations and provides additional information about the tensions that formed weeks before.", "Nuance in the timeline": "The expert notes that the Fox News press office added nuance to the short timeline mentioned by Megyn Kelly. While tensions had been building for weeks, the events that led to the resignations came to a head in the three days before. This aspect highlights the need to consider the broader context and not oversimplify the situation.", "Complicated picture": "The expert points out that the evidence coming out of Missouri paints a much more complicated picture than the one presented by Kelly. The resignation of the university president was primarily influenced by race relations, but the chancellor's resignation was due to a revolt among the university's deans that had peaked a month earlier. This aspect highlights the complexity of the situation and challenges the notion of a single group solely responsible for the resignations.", "Confirmation from news articles": "Fox News provided information that a Google search pulled up more than 8,000 news articles about the role of the students in the resignations. The expert mentions that the stories they read generally noted the same series of events leading up to the administrative shake-up at the university. This aspect reinforces the claim's authenticity by corroborating it with multiple independent sources."}
