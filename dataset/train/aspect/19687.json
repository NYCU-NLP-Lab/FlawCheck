{"The claim that non": "U.S. citizens can apply for asylum from abroad at a U.S. embassy or consulate office is a frequent but wholly inaccurate talking point used by opponents of more open southern border immigration policies.", "The U": "S. Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS) clearly states that to apply for asylum in the U.S., one must be physically present in the country, and having a presence at or proximity to U.S. diplomatic property abroad does not qualify as \"physically present in the U.S.\"", "Several U": "S. embassy websites explicitly state that the United States does not grant asylum in its diplomatic premises abroad, and asylum is only granted to aliens who are physically present in the United States.", "Various sources": "including the Idaho Statesman, U.S. Embassy & Consulates in Mexico, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, U.S. Embassy & Consulates in Italy, and U.S. Embassy & Consulates in Poland, provide information supporting the fact that asylum can only be sought within the United States."}
