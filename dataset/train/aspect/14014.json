{"Lack of explicit pledges by Romney": "The expert's verdict mentions that they could not find any explicit pledges by Mitt Romney to continue tax breaks for oil companies. This indicates that there is no clear statement or commitment from Romney regarding protecting oil company profits.", "Reliance on Romney": "s criticism of Obama's proposals: The expert's verdict states that Priorities USA and others making similar claims rely on Romney's criticism of Obama's proposals and his ties to the oil industry. This suggests that the claim's authenticity is based on Romney's opposition to Obama's energy policies rather than any specific promises or commitments.", "Senate": "s inability to eliminate oil and gas tax loopholes: The expert's verdict mentions that the Senate has not been able to gather enough votes to eliminate tax loopholes for the oil and gas industry. This highlights the ongoing debate and disagreement surrounding these subsidies, indicating that the claim's authenticity is influenced by the lack of concrete actions taken by the government.", "Romney": "s general stance on corporate tax reduction: The expert's verdict mentions that Romney's policies call for reducing the corporate tax rate from 35 to 25 percent but do not specifically address tax breaks for oil companies. This suggests that while Romney advocates for overall corporate tax reduction, there is no specific mention of protecting tax breaks for the oil industry, further questioning the authenticity of the claim."}
