{"Testimony from Christopher Krebs": "The expert's verdict mentions that Christopher Krebs, the director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), called the \"Hammer and Scorecard\" rumors \"nonsense.\" This testimony from a reputable source adds credibility to the claim that the rumors are not authentic.", "Lack of evidence and plot holes": "The expert's verdict highlights that the article promoting the claim does not provide sufficient evidence to support its allegations. It also points out logical inconsistencies, such as the program not being used in previous elections or the lack of action from President Trump to secure the elections. These factors cast doubt on the authenticity of the claim.", "Discrepancies in specific details": "The fact-checking website Lead Stories identifies discrepancies in the specific details provided in the article supporting the claim. For example, the claim that \"Scorecard\" tampered with transfer points between state computers and third-party election data vaults is contradicted by a statement from VR Systems, a company mentioned in the article. This contradiction undermines the credibility of the claim.", "Source credibility": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim originated from a website called American Report, which describes Dennis Montgomery as a \"CIA contractor-turned-whistleblower\" who designed and built the supercomputer. However, the verdict does not explicitly state that Dennis Montgomery or American Report are credible sources. This raises concerns about the reliability and authenticity of the claim."}
