{"Experts have estimated a 1 percent to 3 percent increase in employer premiums in 2011": "due to insurance requirements instituted then under the Affordable Care Act, including preventive care without copays and coverage for young adults up to age 26 on their parents\u2019 plans. This suggests that there may have been some impact on premiums since then.", "However": "the average growth rate for employer plans has been historically low, making it difficult to determine the overall effect of the ACA on premiums. Gary Claxton, vice president and co-director of the Program for the Study of Health Reform and Private Insurance at the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, stated that there was nothing fundamentally large about the ACA that had a noticeable effect on employer plans' premiums.", "Spicer": "s claim that all premiums have increased, whether in an employer-based system or not, is partially true. The ACA focused on changing the nongroup market so that more Americans would be insured, and this market has seen much higher average premium increases compared to the employer-sponsored market.", "The federal health care law required insurers to accept anyone regardless of health status and not vary premiums based on medical conditions in the nongroup market": "Insurers were limited to pricing based on family size, geography, and to a limited extent, age and tobacco use. This change in requirements for the nongroup market was a significant aspect of the ACA."}
