{"Lack of evidence": "The expert's verdict highlights that there is no evidence to support the claim that President Donald Trump sent a plane to the UK to bring Charlie Gard to the United States. The article in question provided no explanation or support for this claim.", "Legal barriers": "At the time the article was written, Charlie Gard's parents were legally barred from moving their son outside the hospital. This makes it highly unlikely that Trump would have sent a plane to the UK during that time.", "White House response": "The expert reached out to the White House to inquire about the claim but did not receive a response. This lack of confirmation from the White House adds to the skepticism surrounding the claim.", "Dubious source": "The source of the claim, World Politicus, has a history of publishing hoaxes or dubious stories. This raises doubts about the reliability and credibility of the information presented in the article."}
