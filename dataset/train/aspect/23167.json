{"The expert considered the statement made by Republican U": "S. Senate hopeful Craig James of Texas, who claimed that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton were negotiating with the United Nations to ban the use of firearms. This claim was recorded by an Austin American-Statesman reporter during a Grassroots America candidate forum in Tyler on May 16, 2012.", "The expert analyzed the speech of James and the context in which he made the claim": "James stated that the United States, Barack Obama, and Hillary Clinton were negotiating with the United Nations for a treaty to ban the use of firearms. He also expressed concern about the potential infringement on the Second Amendment rights.", "The expert examined the support for James": "claim provided by his spokeswoman, Meredith Turney. Turney referred to a Senate floor speech by U.S. Senator Jerry Moran of Kansas, who highlighted the UN conference scheduled for July 2012 that could lead to an international treaty regulating trade in conventional arms. Moran mentioned the possibility of the treaty including limits on civilian firearms, but he also expressed skepticism about its impact on domestic gun rights.", "The expert considered the potential implications of the treaty negotiations and the likelihood of it infringing on the Second Amendment rights": "Senator Moran's Second Amendment Sovereignty Act, introduced in March 2012, aimed to prevent U.S. funds from being used in connection with treaty negotiations that restrict the Second Amendment. Moran expressed confidence that any treaty impinging on domestic gun rights would fail to secure the necessary two-thirds' Senate approval for ratification."}
