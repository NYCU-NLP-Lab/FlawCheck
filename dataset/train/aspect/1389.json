{"Comparison of Trump": "s tweet and Hitler's alleged speech: The expert analyzed the claim by comparing the wording of Trump's tweet and the supposed passage from Hitler's speech. They found that the wording attributed to Hitler was not a documented utterance of his, suggesting that it was likely fabricated.", "Use of Google Translate": "The expert noted that it appeared someone had run the wording of Trump's tweet through Google Translate and attributed the translated result to Hitler. This indicates that the meme's claim may have been based on a faulty translation rather than authentic historical evidence.", "Lack of other references": "The expert mentioned that references to the phrasing attributed to Hitler were not found elsewhere and only appeared on the internet at the same time as the meme itself. This lack of corroborating sources raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Analysis of Hitler": "s actual speech: The expert referred to Hitler's Jan. 30, 1939 Reichstag Speech, in which he discussed the importance of preserving Germany and its culture. However, they highlighted that Hitler did not phrase the concept as succinctly as presented in the meme. Additionally, the focus of Hitler's speech was primarily on opposing the incursion of foreigners and Jews into German territory, rather than warning against a domestic battle over German heritage and history."}
