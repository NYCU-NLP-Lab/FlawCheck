["Opponents claimed the law \"strips unborn children of their rights and\njeopardizes women's health by allowing non-physicians to perform\" abortions\n\n     * Snopes Staff\n     * Published 22 January 2019\n   Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Pinterest Share on Reddit\n   Share via Email\n   Health care professional with stethoscope, arms folded\n\n  Claim\n\n   The state of New York has passed a bill legalizing abortion up to birth.", "Should that\n   happen, the legality of abortion would once again be governed on a\n   state-by-state basis, with states potentially choosing to maintain the\n   status quo under Roe v. Wade, ban abortion entirely, or impose various\n   restrictions on it.", "IFrame\n\n   In anticipation of that possibility, in January 2019 the state of New York\n   enacted the Reproductive Health Act (RHA) to bring state laws in line with\n   current federal law guaranteeing abortion rights, and to preserve access\n   to abortion services should Roe v. Wade be overturned.", "Previously,\n   late-term abortions had only been legal in New York if the life of the\n   mother was at risk."]
