{"Testimony of Union Minister of State for AYUSH": "Shripad Naik: The claim was based on the statement made by Shripad Naik during a press briefing, where he mentioned receiving a phone call from Dr Isaac Mathai, a Bengaluru-based Ayurvedic doctor, who claimed to have successfully treated Prince Charles with ayurvedic and homeopathic medicines.", "News coverage by Indian media": "The claim was widely reported by news agencies and prominent media outlets in India, including a tweet by news agency IANS. This suggests that the claim gained significant attention and was considered newsworthy.", "Support from Manish Tewari": "MP and National Spokesperson of Congress: Manish Tewari tweeted about the claim and suggested that if homeopathy worked for Prince Charles, traditional Indian medicines should be explored further. His endorsement adds credibility to the claim.", "Lack of mention in British papers and BBC report": "It is worth noting that the claim did not find any mention in British papers, and the BBC report shared by Manish Tewari did not mention Prince Charles's homeopathy treatment. This raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim and suggests that it may not have been widely recognized or verified outside of India."}
