{"Number of cases heard by the Supreme Court": "The expert's verdict mentions that Sonia Sotomayor has authored hundreds of officially published majority opinions during her tenure on the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Of those, six cases have been heard by the Supreme Court, indicating that the claim of her rulings being thrown out four times is based on a subset of these cases.", "Reversal rate at the appellate level": "The expert's verdict states that Sotomayor has three reversals, two upheld rulings, and one pending case at the appellate level. This aspect verifies that there have been instances where her rulings were overturned, supporting the claim's assertion of her rulings being thrown out.", "Reversal of a ruling by the Supreme Court": "The expert's verdict mentions that one of Sotomayor's rulings from her time on the U.S. District Court was reversed by the Supreme Court in 1997. This aspect confirms that there has been at least one instance where her ruling was overturned by the highest court.", "Comparison with other justices": "The expert's verdict highlights that other Supreme Court justices, including Samuel Alito, have also experienced reversals in their rulings.
