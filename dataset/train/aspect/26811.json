{"FBI investigation": "The first aspect employed to verify the authenticity of the claim is the results of an FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server. The investigation reviewed the 30,000 emails Clinton turned over to the State Department and found that a small number of them contained classification markings at the time they were sent.", "Confirmation by the State Department": "The second aspect is the confirmation by the State Department that two emails were marked confidential when they were sent to Clinton. These emails were call sheets prepared for phone calls with foreign leaders and retained their confidential markings due to human error.", "Classification levels of emails": "The third aspect is the classification levels of the emails found during the investigation. It was revealed that 110 emails in 52 email chains contained information that was classified at the time they were sent or received. Eight chains contained top secret information, 36 chains contained secret information, and the remaining eight contained confidential information. However, most of these emails did not have clear markings indicating their classified status.", "Retroactive classification": "The fourth aspect is the retroactive classification of about 2,000 additional emails. These emails were not classified when they were first sent but were later up-classified during the review process. This practice is common when documents are reviewed for release, according to transparency experts."}
