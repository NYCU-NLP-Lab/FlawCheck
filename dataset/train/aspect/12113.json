{"The claim made by Donald Trump": "s ad is that Hillary Clinton wants illegal immigrants convicted of crimes to stay in the United States and collect Social Security benefits.", "The fact": "check examines whether a Clinton administration would have Social Security benefit checks going to the 11 million people currently in the United States illegally.", "It is stated that while immigrants in deferred action status are not eligible for Social Security or most other federal benefits": "they are not barred from federal programs associated with working in the United States, such as Social Security and Medicare.", "To be eligible for Social Security": "a person would have to pay into the system for at least 10 years and couldn't start collecting until retirement age, making it unlikely that the children and young adults in the deferred action category would be covered by Social Security for decades."}
