{"Inaccurate nomenclature": "The expert highlighted that the claim inaccurately referred to the phenomenon as a \"Hunter's Moon,\" which has nothing to do with the optical illusion of two suns. The Hunter's Moon is simply the name for the full moon after the Harvest Moon, which can occur in either October or November.", "Timing discrepancy": "The expert pointed out that the claim suggested the occurrence of the phenomenon on 3 November 2015, while the actual Hunter's Moon for that year took place on 26 and 27 October 2015. This discrepancy in timing raised doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Unrelated photographs": "The expert mentioned that two of the appended photographs were unrelated to the full moon of October 2015. This discrepancy indicated that the images provided did not support the claim of a rare phenomenon.", "Earlier publication of identical pictures": "The expert noted that the photographs of a \"Hunter's Moon\" had been published on an Arabic-language message board on 13 October 2015, prior to the year's Hunter's Moon. This earlier publication with a different explanation of the photographs' origins suggested that the claim was fabricated to fit the existing pictures."}
