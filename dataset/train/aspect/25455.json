{"Lack of evidence on Owens": "Twitter account: The expert found no evidence that the alleged tweet was actually posted to Candace Owens' Twitter account. They searched for traces of the deleted message via broken URLs and found none. They also searched for archives of Owens' entire Twitter timeline and the alleged message does not appear on any of those archived pages.", "Absence of links to the alleged deleted tweet": "None of the contemporary blog articles that reported on the alleged tweet provided a link to the deleted tweet. This lack of direct evidence raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Inability to find records on the Wayback Machine and internet archive": "The expert searched these platforms for any record of the allegedly deleted message but came up empty. This further supports the lack of evidence for the claim.", "Context and motivation for the creation of the fake tweet": "The expert highlights the context in which this message originally went viral, which was during a controversy involving Candace Owens and singer Harry Styles. The expert suggests that it is more plausible that an angry Styles fan created a photoshopped tweet to denigrate Owens rather than Owens herself tweeting such an attack. The motivation behind the creation of the fake tweet adds to the skepticism surrounding its authenticity."}
