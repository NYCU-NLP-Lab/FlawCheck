{"Official election results": "The expert verified the authenticity of the claim by referring to the official election results provided by the Georgia Secretary of State. These results showed that less than half of one percent of all ballots in Fulton County were rejected, indicating that the claim of \"massive duplicate ballots\" and \"rejected ballots\" was not accurate.", "Provisional ballot recap notice": "The expert examined a provisional ballot recap notice from the Fulton County Department of Registration and Elections. This notice reported that out of the 3,722 provisional ballots received, only 1,811 were duplicates and 1,556 were rejected. The reasons for rejection included cases of \"not a citizen,\" \"not registered,\" and \"out of county.\" This information contradicted the claim of \"massive duplicate ballots\" and suggested that the number of rejected ballots was relatively small.", "Alternative source": "The expert also considered information provided by a spokeswoman for Fulton County, who shared slightly different numbers regarding the provisional ballots. According to this source, out of the 3,549 provisional ballots received, 1,994 were accepted and 1,555 were rejected. The reasons for rejection were consistent with the previous information, further supporting the conclusion that the claim of \"massive duplicate ballots\" was not accurate.", "Voter registration and noncitizen voting": "The expert analyzed the voter registration and noncitizen voting data provided. The numbers showed that only two noncitizens cast a ballot, representing a negligible percentage of the overall vote. Additionally, the reasons for ballot rejection, such as voters not being registered or voting in the wrong county, were in line with standard voting procedures and did not indicate any fraudulent or widespread irregularities."}
