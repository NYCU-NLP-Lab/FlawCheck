{"U": "S. Sen. Joni Ernst received the COVID-19 vaccine in December 2020, which verifies the claim that she received the vaccine.", "Ernst never described COVID": "19 as a \"hoax\" and repeatedly advocated and encouraged the use of face masks, contradicting the claim that she called COVID-19 a \"hoax\" and was an \"anti-masker.\"", "The official COVID": "19 death toll was not inflated by Ernst's claim that doctors exaggerated the number of COVID-related deaths to enrich themselves.", "Prominent Republican lawmakers": "including Ernst, who previously downplayed the extent and risk of the pandemic or opposed face mask mandates, availed themselves of early access to the vaccine, supporting the claim that she received the vaccine after opposing mask mandates."}
