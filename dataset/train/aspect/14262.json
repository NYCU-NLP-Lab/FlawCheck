{"The claim is based on old images": "The expert's verdict highlights that the images used in the claim are not recent and do not accurately depict the current migrant caravan. The images are from 2013 and April of this year, which raises doubts about the claim's authenticity.", "Credible sources and photographers": "The expert's verdict mentions that the images were taken by reputable photographers, Eduardo Verdugo and Jose Castanares, for the Associated Press and AFP/Getty Images, respectively. This adds credibility to the fact that the images are not depicting the current migrant caravan.", "News reports contradict the claim": "The expert's verdict cites news reports from April that mention some migrants traveling in buses to the Mexico-U.S. border. This contradicts the claim's assertion that migrants are not walking and are instead using trains and buses to reach the United States.", "Presence of pictures and videos documenting the travel": "The expert's verdict mentions that there are plenty of pictures and videos documenting the travel of the current migrant caravan. This implies that there is evidence available that shows the majority of migrants walking, rather than using trains and buses as claimed in the post."}
