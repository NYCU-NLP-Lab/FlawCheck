{"Lack of evidence": "The expert found no record of Ilhan Omar ever saying the words attributed to her in the claim. This lack of evidence is a significant aspect in verifying the authenticity of the claim.", "Inaccurate reflection of views": "The sentiment expressed in the claim, even as a paraphrase, does not accurately reflect Omar's views. The expert highlights that Omar has made several public statements explicitly detailing her perspective as a refugee, immigrant, Muslim, and American citizen, none of which involve the idea of \"taking over\" America.", "Oath to uphold the American Constitution": "In an interview with Steven Colbert, Omar stated that she took an oath to uphold the American Constitution and considers herself as American as anyone else. This aspect reinforces her loyalty to America and contradicts the claim made in the meme.", "Advocacy for Muslim rights and civil liberties": "Omar has consistently advocated for the rights and civil liberties of American Muslims. In a speech before the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), she argued that American Muslims should be able to fully express themselves in the public sphere and have every civil liberty extended to them. This aspect further discredits the claim that she intends to \"take over\" America."}
