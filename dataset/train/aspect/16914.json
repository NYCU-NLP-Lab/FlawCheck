{"The source of the claim": "The expert identifies the initial article published by dailyworldupdate.us as the source of the claim. This website is part of the \"Last Line of Defense\" network of junk news sites, known for publishing satire and fake news.", "Lack of disclaimer and multiple republishing": "The expert notes that although the initial article carried a disclaimer and satire tags, it was later republished by several disreputable websites without any indication of its fictional nature. This suggests that the claim was taken seriously and spread without proper verification.", "Verbatim copies on other websites": "The expert found verbatim copies of the article on multiple websites, including America 2020 Review, Seattle Media Daily, Harley and the Davidsons, Conference Scene, and Fight for America. None of these websites provided any disclaimer labeling the article as fiction.", "Social media propagation": "The claim was widely shared on social media platforms by numerous accounts. While the intent behind sharing may not be definitively determined, a message from the \"DanAconda\" account suggests that the aim was to sow division. This highlights the role of social media in spreading and amplifying unverified information."}
