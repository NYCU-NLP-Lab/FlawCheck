{"Forced labor and slave": "like conditions: The expert's verdict confirms that workers in Malaysia, particularly in the electronics industry, are subjected to forced labor and work in slave-like conditions. This is based on evidence from labor and human rights groups, as well as the acknowledgment of the U.S. government.", "Verit\u00e9 report": "The expert refers to a 2014 report from Verit\u00e9, an NGO that monitors labor standard compliance. The report interviewed 501 workers in Malaysia's electronics industry and found that 28 percent of them were coerced under both global standards and Malaysian law. This report provides empirical evidence supporting the claim.", "Violation of International Labor Organization guidelines": "The expert highlights that the Malaysian electronics industry violated all four dimensions of forced labor defined by the International Labor Organization (unfree recruitment, work and life duress, impossibility of leaving an employer, and penalty or menace of penalty). This further strengthens the authenticity of the claim.", "Withholding of passports and other abuses": "The expert's verdict mentions that 94 percent of workers had their passports withheld by the factory or agent, which is prohibited by local labor laws. Additionally, workers were charged excessive job-finding fees, deceived about their wages, and lived in crowded and unsafe housing. These aspects provide concrete evidence of the exploitative conditions faced by workers in Malaysia."}
