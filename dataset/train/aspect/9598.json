{"Definition of a tax in Oregon government": "The expert points out that a tax in Oregon has a specific definition, as outlined in the state constitution. It requires a higher number of votes to pass than a fee and must raise revenue for the general treasury. The expert refers to the Legislative Counsel opinion that the nickel charge on paper bags does not meet this definition.", "Comparison to the bottle bill deposit": "The expert mentions that the bag charge is most similar to the bottle bill deposit in Oregon. Under the bottle bill, consumers have to pay an extra nickel for certain beverages, but the money stays with distributors unless the bottle is returned. The expert suggests that the bag charge operates in a similar manner, further supporting the argument that it is not a tax.", "Comparison to the": "public purpose charge\" on utility bills: The expert brings up the example of a \"public purpose charge\" imposed on electricity and gas bills by state lawmakers. This charge does not count as a tax or a fee because the money does not go into state coffers. Instead, it is used for specific purposes, such as weatherizing schools and low-income homes. The expert implies that the bag charge falls into a similar category, as the money does not go to the state but can be spent by grocers as they choose.", "Agreement with former legislative counsel": "The expert mentions that former legislative counsel Greg Chaimov agrees with the current Legislative Counsel opinion that the nickel provision is neither a tax nor a fee. Chaimov states that it is whatever the grocers want to call it, and for constitutional purposes, a fee or tax is only at issue if it brings money into the government. This agreement with a legal expert adds weight to the argument that the bag charge is not a tax."}
