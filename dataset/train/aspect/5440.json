{"The claim was reported by The People of Lancaster website": "which is known for publishing satire articles. This suggests that the claim may not be authentic.", "The article included a quote from a Weather Channel photographer": "Ernie Schwartz, who claimed to have captured the image. However, further investigation revealed that Ernie Schwartz is not a real person associated with The Weather Channel, indicating that the quote was fabricated.", "The expert found that the first photograph used to support the claim was actually taken in 2004 during Hurricane Frances": "and the second photograph was taken in 2005 as Hurricane Dennis approached Florida. This evidence proves that neither of the images originally featured flying dolphins, undermining the authenticity of the claim.", "The People of Lancaster website later reposted the first image in September 2019": "falsely claiming it was taken during Hurricane Dorian. This demonstrates a pattern of misinformation and further calls into question the credibility of the claim."}
