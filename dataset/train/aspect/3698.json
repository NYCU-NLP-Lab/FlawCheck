{"The claim is based on a tweet by Moneycontrol that attributed a statement to Congress MP Kapil Sibal": "where he supposedly said that B R Ambedkar had agreed to the two-nation theory perpetrated by VD Savarkar. The tweet provided a direct quote from Sibal's speech in the Rajya Sabha opposing the Citizenship Amendment Bill.", "The live blog on the Parliamentary proceedings": "tweeted by Moneycontrol, does not mention Sibal's supposed statement on Ambedkar agreeing with Savarkar on the two-nation theory. This raises doubts about the accuracy of the claim.", "OpIndia": "a right-wing website, published an article referencing the Moneycontrol tweet and misquoted Sibal, attributing a statement to him that he did not make. This highlights the possibility of misinformation or misinterpretation of Sibal's actual words.", "Alt News": "a fact-checking website, investigated the claim and found that Kapil Sibal had been misquoted. They provided the exact words spoken by Sibal in the Rajya Sabha, which did not mention Ambedkar agreeing with Savarkar on the two-nation theory. Alt News' verification adds credibility to their conclusion that the claim is not authentic."}
