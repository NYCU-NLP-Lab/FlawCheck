{"Election returns": "The expert verified the authenticity of the claim by checking the official election returns posted on the website of Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted. These returns showed that there was no county in which President Obama received 106,258 votes or any similar number. Additionally, the expert found that the vote for Obama did not exceed the number of eligible voters.", "Online search": "The expert conducted an online search to find the origin of the claim. They discovered that the claim was a twist on numerous blog postings, many of which were worded identically. These blog posts made the odd assertion that Obama \"won the majority of Wood County's 108 percent of registered voters.\" The expert traced the source of these blog posts to a right-leaning blog called frontpagemag.com.", "Source analysis": "The expert analyzed the source of the claim, frontpagemag.com, and found that the blog post headline stated, \"Voter Fraud: Obama Won %108 of Registered Voters in Ohio County.\" However, upon reading the text of the blog post, the expert determined that the numbers were misleading and did not support the claim of voter fraud. The blog post mentioned a situation well known to election officials, indicating that it was not a credible source.", "Comparison with eligible voters": "The expert compared the number of votes received by President Obama (106,258) with the number of eligible voters (98,213) in the county mentioned in the claim. By doing this comparison, the expert determined that the claim of Obama receiving more votes than there were eligible voters was not accurate. This comparison further verified the inauthenticity of the claim."}
