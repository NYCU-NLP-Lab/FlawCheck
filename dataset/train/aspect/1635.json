These posts are created to provoke anger and outrage on the internet.", "Origins on 4chan": "The expert mentions that the origins of the #PitbullDropOff campaign can be traced back to 4chan, an anonymous message board known for uniting trolls, \"incels,\" and neo-Nazis. This suggests that the campaign is driven by individuals with malicious intentions rather than a genuine phenomenon.", "Use of reverse image search": "The expert mentions that many of the images shared with the #PitbullDropOff hashtag can be easily found through reverse image search and predate the hashtag by years. This indicates that the images are unrelated to the campaign and have been falsely associated with it.", "Political ideology": "The expert points out that the underlying motivations for the #PitbullDropOff campaign align with the political ideology of the /pol/ message board, which holds the belief that women, liberals, and minorities are destroying America.
