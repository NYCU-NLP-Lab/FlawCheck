{"The direct mail piece and campaign TV ad specifically mention that Sandy Pasch": "voted to allow public school employees to use taxpayer dollars to pick up the tab for\u2026Viagra.\" This indicates that the claim is based on a specific vote or action taken by Pasch.", "The expert mentions that Darling": "s camp was asked to explain the connection between a nearly decade-old dispute over MPS coverage of Viagra and Pasch, but they did not cite a specific vote on the issue. This suggests that there may not be concrete evidence or a direct link between Pasch's vote and the claim.", "The expert also notes that Pasch is pro": "union and has supported a reversal of collective bargaining limits, but there is no mention of her specifically advocating for Viagra coverage or supporting the use of taxpayer dollars for it. This indicates that there may be a lack of evidence supporting the claim.", "The expert": "s verdict highlights the discrepancy between the TV ad's claim about Pasch voting to allow public school employees to use taxpayer dollars for Viagra and the response from Darling's campaign manager, who offers a more general explanation about collective bargaining and the power of unions. This suggests that the claim may be exaggerated or misleading."}
