{"Comparison to historical data": "The expert compared the claim to historical data from the 1920s to verify the authenticity of the statement. They examined the income distribution in 1928 and 2012, finding that these were the two years where the top 1 percent of the richest Americans earned the greatest share of the nation's income.", "Research from an expert": "The expert referenced research conducted by Emmanuel Saez, a University of California-Berkeley economics professor who studies wealth and income inequality. Saez's research, cited in a report by the Pew Research Center, provided data on the distribution of top incomes for more than 20 countries, including the United States.", "Comparison to a contrasting viewpoint": "The expert highlighted that the claim made by Bernie Sanders was similar to a statement made by Senator Ted Cruz, a politician from the opposite end of the political spectrum. By noting this similarity, the expert aimed to provide additional credibility to the claim.", "Cautionary note and potential factors": "The expert acknowledged the need for caution and mentioned two reasons that could potentially affect the authenticity of the claim. They pointed out that other recent years did not rank as high on the list of income inequality, suggesting that the 2012 result may have been a temporary anomaly. Additionally, the expert mentioned the impact of tax hikes in 2013, which may have influenced taxpayers' behavior and affected income distribution."}
