{"The commercial advertisement": "The expert mentions that the claim was initially presented through a commercial advertisement produced by TBWA Worldwide. This commercial depicted a pickup truck saving a plane after its landing gear malfunctioned. The expert highlights that the advertisement was designed to resemble a breaking news story, including witness reports, shaky handheld footage, and an interview with the driver who insisted he was not a hero.", "Fictionalization disclaimer": "The expert notes that the commercial included a disclaimer in small letters at the bottom of the screen stating \"Fictionalization. Do not attempt.\" However, many viewers missed this disclaimer and believed they had watched a real news segment. This aspect highlights the presence of a disclaimer that indicated the event shown in the advertisement was not real.", "Implausibility of the event": "The expert refers to a Jalopnik article that raises doubts about the feasibility of the event shown in the advertisement. The article argues that the weight of the airplane landing on the pickup truck would exceed its maximum capacity, potentially causing damage to the tires, rims, suspension, and more. This aspect highlights the technical implausibility of the claim.", "Misleading advertisements": "The expert mentions that the landing gear failure ad was one of several deceptive television spots created by Nissan and TBWA Worldwide in 2011. Another ad titled \"Hill Climb\" was specifically criticized by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) for misrepresenting the performance of the Nissan Frontier pickup truck. The FTC stated that the ad portrayed the truck rescuing a dune buggy on a steep hill, but in reality, both vehicles were dragged by cables. This aspect highlights the pattern of misleading advertisements created by Nissan and TBWA Worldwide."}
