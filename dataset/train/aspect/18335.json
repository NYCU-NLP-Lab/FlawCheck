{"Inability to verify price and ingredients": "The expert mentioned that they could not verify the price or the ingredients of the InteliGEN supplement, which raises concerns about the authenticity of the claim.", "Synthetic ingredient": "The expert highlighted that one of the ingredients, vinpocetine, is not all-natural but rather a synthetic alkaloid derived from the periwinkle plant. This contradicts the claim made by the product's website that it only contains \"all-natural, pure and safe ingredients.\"", "Lack of patents and clinical evidence": "The expert found no patents registered in the United States for a product called InteliGEN, and they were unable to locate any evidence of clinical trials or testing on the supplement. This casts doubt on the product's claim of being \"carefully crafted with patent ingredients\" and \"clinically proven.\"", "Vagueness and lack of transparency": "The InteliGEN website was described as vague and lacking a label or full list of ingredients. This lack of transparency makes it difficult for potential customers to make informed decisions about the product's authenticity and safety."}
