{"The claim was based on a doctored photograph": "The expert's verdict states that the image used to support the claim was manipulated. The original photograph was from a news story about a hacker, not George Soros in handcuffs before a judge.", "Lack of evidence for ownership of voting equipment": "The claim suggests that George Soros owned stakes in a particular brand of voting equipment, Smartmatic, which was allegedly tampered with. However, the expert's verdict states that there was no truth to this claim.", "Inconsistent sources and repetition of the claim": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim appeared on multiple websites, including The People's Resistance and Daily USA Update. These sources repeated the same information about Soros being indicted for tampering with voting machines, indicating a lack of reliable and diverse sources supporting the claim.", "Verifiable facts contradict the claim": "The expert's verdict mentions that the state of Ohio found tampered voting machines in more than a dozen counties but did not tie them directly to the George Soros Corporation. Additionally, the Federal Election Commission did not issue an indictment against Soros related to this matter. These verifiable facts contradict the claim's assertion of Soros' involvement in tampering with voting equipment."}
