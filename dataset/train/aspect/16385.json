{"Lack of evidence": "The expert found no evidence to support the claim that Qassem Soleimani was part of the group that stormed the American embassy in Tehran in 1979 and took 52 hostages. The image used in the viral meme does not name anyone in the picture, and there is no documentation, at least in English, that Soleimani was involved.", "Historical context": "The expert provides background information about the Iranian hostage crisis in 1979, highlighting that it was a significant event during the Iranian revolution and the overthrow of the U.S.-backed Shah of Iran. Given the intense coverage and lasting tensions between the U.S. and Iran over the hostage crisis, it seems unlikely that Soleimani's alleged involvement would have gone unnoticed.", "Soleimani": "s rank and role: The expert mentions that Soleimani was a major general of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps and described as the Iranian government's second-in-command. Given his high rank and position, it is unlikely that his alleged involvement in the embassy storming would have been undocumented or unnoticed."}
