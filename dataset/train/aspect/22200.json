{"The expert referred to a news article from The Hill newspaper on July 28": "2011, which mentioned the comparison of Pell Grants to welfare by House conservatives who were stalling legislation to raise the national debt limit. This article provided some context for the claim being made.", "The expert cited a statement made by Democratic U": "S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse on the Senate floor, where he defended the increase in Pell Grant funding and mentioned the history and purpose of the grants. This statement supported the claim and provided additional information about the intention behind Pell Grants.", "The expert mentioned a document from the Federal Education Budget Project of the New America Foundation": "a left-leaning think tank, which stated that in fiscal year 1976, a full Pell Grant covered 72 percent of the cost of attendance at a typical four-year public college. This document provided specific data to support the claim.", "The expert cross": "referenced the think tank's numbers with the U.S. Department of Education, which administers the Pell Grant program. The department confirmed that the maximum grant amount was $5,350 in a specific year, which indicated a decrease in the purchasing power of Pell Grants over time. This verification added credibility to the claim."}
