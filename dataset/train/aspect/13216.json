Constitution's definition of impeachment: The expert mentions that the U.S. Constitution grants the House of Representatives the power of impeachment, while it is up to the Senate to convict and remove a president from office. This aspect highlights the constitutional process and the roles of both chambers in the impeachment process.", "The interpretation of impeachment and conviction": "The expert mentions that impeachment is akin to bringing formal charges against an individual, while conviction occurs when the Senate finds the individual guilty of those charges. This aspect clarifies the distinction between impeachment and conviction and sets the context for the subsequent theories.", "Theory 1": "Nullification of the first term: The expert discusses the first theory, which suggests that if a president is impeached by the House but not convicted by the Senate, their first term is nullified, allowing them to run for office two more times. This aspect explores the hypothetical scenario and the potential implications of a failed impeachment on a president's term limits.", "Lack of historical support for nullification": "The expert presents historical evidence by referring to President Bill Clinton's impeachment in 1998. Despite being impeached by the House, Clinton was not convicted by the Senate. The expert mentions that no serious reporters, historians, or politicians argued that this failure to convict nullified Clinton's previous term or made him eligible to run for office again. This aspect provides a historical perspective and highlights the absence of support for the claim based on past events."}
