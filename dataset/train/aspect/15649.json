{"Historical evidence": "The expert mentions that in the post-World War II era, there have been 10 recessions, and after most of them, employment lagged behind other improving economic indicators. This historical evidence supports the claim that job growth always lags behind economic growth.", "Expert opinion": "The expert quotes William Beach, director of the conservative Heritage Foundation's center for data analysis, who agrees with the claim. Beach states that job growth comes back slowly after a recession, particularly in service jobs. This expert opinion further verifies the claim.", "Comparison with previous jobless recoveries": "The expert mentions that Democrats criticized President George W. Bush for the 2001 \"jobless recovery,\" similar to how some Republicans now criticize President Obama for the current one. This comparison suggests a pattern of job growth lagging behind economic growth in previous instances, strengthening the claim's authenticity.", "Statistical analysis": "The expert refers to a report by the San Francisco Chronicle, which relied on numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The report indicates that in the eight recessions between 1949 and 1991, unemployment rates lagged by an average of about three months. After the last two recessions, it took significantly longer (15 months and 19 months) before unemployment rates peaked. This statistical analysis supports the claim that job growth historically lags behind economic growth."}
