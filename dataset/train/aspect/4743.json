{"Visual evidence": "The expert's verdict mentions that News18 India aired footage of an area drowned in water, showing the calamitous situation in Pakistan's Karachi.

He explains that he jumped into the water to rescue a teenaged boy but arrived after the boy had already been rescued by the municipal corporation.", "Comparison of locations": "The expert's verdict mentions that both the video aired by News18 India and the original footage sent by Jafar show a mosque's minaret in the background. By comparing the two clips and confirming that they were filmed in the same location, it helps verify the authenticity of the claim.", "Social media evidence": "The expert's verdict includes a tweet from Shahnawaz Ansari, who states that the video aired by News18 India is actually a three-day-old video from Indore, not Karachi.
