{"Lack of personal recollection and absence of online evidence": "The expert mentions that they do not remember seeing any signs like the ones described in the claim, and they cannot find any mention of them on Google. This suggests that there is no personal or online evidence to support the existence of such signs.", "Contemporaneous press reports": "The expert refers to contemporaneous press reports that mention the erection of signs along designated roadways as early as 1951. These reports provide historical evidence supporting the claim and indicate that the signs were part of a civil defense preparedness initiative launched by the Truman administration.", "Connection to the Cold War context": "The expert highlights the historical context of the Cold War, where the fear of a nuclear confrontation was prevalent. They mention that the signs were driven by events like the Soviet Union's first atom bomb test in 1949 and the Korean War in 1950. This connection to the Cold War era adds credibility to the claim.", "Civil defense planning and emergency transportation networks": "The expert mentions a section of the Blue Book, which called for the creation of emergency transportation networks to facilitate both military and civilian use of roadways. This indicates that there were plans and procedures in place for emergency traffic control in case of an enemy attack. The mention of police training and the role of local civil defense coordinators further supports the existence of measures taken to ensure controlled movement during emergencies."}
