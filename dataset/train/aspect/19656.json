{"The estimate of job losses tied to NAFTA and China trade deals is based on studies conducted by the Economic Policy Institute": "EPI), a pro-union think tank. These studies use data from employment, census, and trade data to estimate the number of jobs that may have been displaced due to trade deficits.", "The General Accounting Office": "GAO), a nonpartisan agency, has stated that the job losses attributed to NAFTA and China trade deals may have been overestimated.

The CRS also found that various studies by different organizations did not attribute changes in employment levels directly to NAFTA.", "The estimate of jobs lost to China due to trade deals is also based on the concept of": "displaced production\" rather than a direct count of actual job losses. This means that the numbers represent the potential number of jobs that could have been supported by production that was displaced by trade imbalances with China."}
