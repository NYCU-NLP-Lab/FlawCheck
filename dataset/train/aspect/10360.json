{"The claim is based on a video that was posted on YouTube on March 30": "2012, the same day Barrett announced his candidacy. The video presents audio segments of a radio interview Barrett did on WTMJ-AM (620) host Charlie Sykes' annual issues show, \"Insight 2011.\"", "The video shows Barrett offering his solution to the standoff between Walker and the 14 Senate Democrats who had left the state to block action on the measure": "Barrett suggests that collective bargaining changes are not fiscal and could be voted on separately.", "The American Federation of State": "County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), the largest state employees union, released a message to its members on April 3, 2012, expressing their qualms with Barrett. The message claims that Barrett advocated for the strategy Walker eventually used to pass the bill, rather than standing in solidarity with the Democratic heroes who opposed it.", "The claim is supported by the AFSCME message": "which states that Barrett was on right-wing talk radio pontificating about how to undermine the efforts of the Democratic senators who were blocking the bill. This suggests that Barrett did support the passage of Gov. Scott Walker's bill stripping collective bargaining rights from state employees."}
