This was based on election results from 2012, which showed local Democrats winning countywide races in two of the bordering counties.", "Analysis of county demographics": "Although not explicitly mentioned in the expert's verdict, it is possible that the demographics of the surrounding counties were considered to assess their political leanings. Factors such as population composition, voter registration data, and historical voting patterns could have been taken into account to verify the claim."}
