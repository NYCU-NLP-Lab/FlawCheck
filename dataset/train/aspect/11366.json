{"U": "S. Attorney Jeff Sessions' statement: The expert's verdict mentions that U.S. Attorney Jeff Sessions berated Chicago for its sanctuary city status during a speech in Miami on Aug. 16, 2017. This statement by a high-ranking law enforcement officer supports the claim that Chicago has adopted a policy of protecting criminal aliens.", "Lawsuit against the U": "S. Justice Department: The expert's verdict highlights that when Chicago filed a lawsuit on Aug. 7 to block the U.S. Justice Department from withholding federal police grant money from sanctuary cities, Jeff Sessions reacted strongly. This indicates that Chicago's sanctuary city status is being challenged by the federal government, further supporting the claim.", "Chicago": "s Welcoming City Ordinance: The expert's verdict explains that Chicago has a Welcoming City Ordinance, which defines its sanctuary city status. This ordinance states that the Chicago Police Department will not question crime victims, witnesses, and law-abiding residents about their legal status. It also limits interaction between police officers and federal immigration agents. These aspects of the ordinance demonstrate Chicago's policy of protecting immigrants and not using immigration status as grounds for detention.", "Trust": "building between immigrant communities and police: The expert's verdict mentions that Chicago, like other cities with similar policies, believes that its sanctuary city status fosters trust between immigrant communities and the police department. This is because immigrants won't fear coming to the police to report crimes or assist in police investigations. This aspect supports the claim that Chicago's policy aims to protect immigrant populations."}
