{"The claim states that Eric Trump said": "The president should be able to choose governors, senators, and congressmen, just like our founders meant it to be. The only election should be for president.\" This statement is the central claim that needs to be verified for authenticity.", "The expert": "s verdict provides information about Eric Trump's actual statement on Fox & Friends on Nov. 6, 2018. He encouraged Republicans and Trump supporters to vote for other races, but there is no mention of him advocating for the president to have the authority to appoint state and local representatives. This contrast between the claim and the actual statement raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim."}
