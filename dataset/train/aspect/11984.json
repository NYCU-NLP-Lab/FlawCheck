{"Difficulty in obtaining unreleased Beatles material": "The expert explains that prior to the rise of the internet, it was challenging for Beatles fans to collect unreleased material. This was due to the lack of reliable information sources and the prevalence of inaccurate and contradictory publications.", "Reliance on bootleg recordings": "Fans often had to rely on purchasing bootleg records and tapes through mail or swap meets to obtain unreleased Beatles songs. However, this method was unreliable as buyers rarely had the opportunity to listen to the recordings in advance, leading to disappointments such as mislabeled tracks or poor audio quality.", "Lack of an official master list": "The absence of an official master list of all the Beatles' recorded material made it difficult for collectors to determine which songs were genuine. Fans and writers compiled their own lists from various sources, resulting in a growing number of unreleased Beatles titles that were challenging to verify.", "Limited number of completed outtakes": "Contrary to popular belief, the Beatles had only a small number of completed outtakes that were left unreleased. These outtakes were eventually released on the Anthology series of CDs in 1995-96. The engineer John Barrett cataloged all the preserved session tapes, revealing that the treasure trove of lost Beatles recordings was largely a myth."}
