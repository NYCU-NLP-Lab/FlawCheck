{"The polling data was commissioned by the League of Conservation Voters": "an environmental group, and conducted by a polling team that included one Democratic firm and one Republican firm. This indicates that the data was collected by a bipartisan group, adding credibility to the claim.", "The poll was taken between July 8 and July 10": "2013, with 600 respondents, all of whom were registered voters between 18 and 34 who voted in the 2012 general election. This provides specific details about the sample size and demographic characteristics of the respondents, ensuring the claim is based on a representative group.", "The poll asked respondents to describe their view of climate change": "and only 3 percent of the respondents in the 18 to 34 age group stated that climate change is not really happening. This specific response option and percentage supports the claim made by Senator Chris Murphy.", "The fact that the poll was paid for by an environmental group is acknowledged": "but the inclusion of two polling firms, one from each party, adds credibility to the poll. This demonstrates an effort to ensure a balanced approach and minimize bias in the data collection process."}
