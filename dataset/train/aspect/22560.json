This absence of an official statement supports the conclusion that the claim is not authentic.", "Recent race featuring traditions": "The expert mentions a specific race, the Dixie Vodka 400, which took place after NASCAR's ban on the Confederate flag. The race included a pre-race prayer, the singing of the national anthem, and a military flyover. The presence of these traditions contradicts the claim that NASCAR had done away with them, providing further evidence against the claim's authenticity.", "Change in rules regarding national anthem": "The expert notes that NASCAR recently removed its rules requiring team members to stand during the national anthem, allowing racers to peacefully protest.
