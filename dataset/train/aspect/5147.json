{"The claim states that face masks violate US labor standards for oxygen deprivation": "The expert's verdict confirms that this claim is false, as the US Department of Labor Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has made no determination about masks' impact on oxygen levels. OSHA generally recommends that employers encourage workers to wear face coverings at work.", "The claim suggests that cloth masks do not filter anything and trap carbon dioxide": "posing a risk to health. The expert's verdict dismisses this claim as false and misleading. Cloth masks are recommended by the CDC as a means to help stop the spread of the virus. While cloth masks may not provide the same level of filtration as surgical masks or N95 masks, they still offer some level of protection.", "The claim states that surgical masks spread germs": "The expert's verdict contradicts this claim, stating that wearing surgical masks does not cause individuals to breathe in germs from everywhere they went. Surgical masks are designed to help prevent the spread of respiratory droplets from the wearer to others, reducing the risk of transmission.", "The claim suggests that N95 masks expel unfiltered air": "potentially spreading the virus. The expert's verdict does not directly address this specific claim, but it highlights that President Donald Trump, who initially refused to wear a mask, eventually urged Americans to wear one. This implies that the claim may not hold true, as even high-level officials recognize the importance of wearing masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19."}
