{"The image in the tweet shows three couples dressed as brides and grooms in an area with French signage that loosely translates as": "Divorce Hall -- by any means allowed\". The caption states that in Ghana, one must dress like their wedding day to get divorced.", "Another widely shared tweet and a screenshot of the tweet on Facebook also feature the same image": "3. Some social media users pointed out that the sign on the wall is in French, which is not an official language in Ghana. Ghana's official language is English, and it has more than 250 languages and dialects.", "A reverse image search of the picture led to the original version of the photo": "taken in 2009 in northern Uganda, which shows three brides and three grooms praying ahead of a group wedding in a church. This suggests that the image is not related to Ghana's divorce laws."}
