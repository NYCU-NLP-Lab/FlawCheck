{"The claim made by Jim Webb that there was no federal income tax in the United States until 1913": "2. The historical evidence provided that in 1913, the U.S. began a tax on individual incomes, contradicting Webb's claim.", "The mention of the income tax imposed during the Civil War in 1862": "which indicates that income tax existed prior to 1913.", "The explanation of the 16th Amendment": "ratified in 1913, which allowed the federal income tax to be levied without any apportionment among states, further contradicting Webb's claim."}
