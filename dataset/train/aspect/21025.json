{"The claim is supported by statements made by ABC and NPR political contributor Cokie Roberts": "who stated that the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq have cost every American family something like $45,000. This provides a direct source of information for the claim.", "The Cost of War Project": "a nonprofit organization housed at Brown University, has conducted studies on war costs and estimated that the cost of the two wars has reached $4 trillion. This provides an independent analysis and research-based evidence to support the claim.", "The Census data reports that there were almost 115 million households in the country from 2007": "2011. This provides a statistical reference point to understand the potential impact of war costs on American families.", "The claim mentions that wars in the past were financed through war bonds or raising taxes": "while current wars have been funded almost entirely by borrowing. This highlights a distinct aspect of the financial burden associated with the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, emphasizing the long-term implications and potential economic consequences for American families."}
