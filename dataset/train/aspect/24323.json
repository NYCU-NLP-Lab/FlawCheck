{"Multiple articles and websites": "including Your News Wire, Prepare for Change, and the Geller Report, shared false information about France legalizing pedophilia. These articles were widely shared on social media platforms.", "Marlene Schiappa": "France's gender equality minister, publicly denounced the claims as \"fake news\" and denied that the law created a loophole for pedophilia. She emphasized that the law actually provided special protections for underage victims of pedophilia.", "The government website clarified that pedophilia has not been legalized in any situation in France": "It highlighted that more severe penalties are applied when a minor is a victim of pedophilia or sexual aggression committed by adults.", "The alleged": "sex classes\" in schools, claimed to be a result of the law, were not found in the text of the Schiappa law or the published kindergarten curriculum. Sex education is included in the education program for French students, but it is introduced at a later grade level (CM1) when children are around 9 years old. The law from 2001 mandates sexual information and education in primary and secondary schools, but it does not apply to kindergarten."}
