{"Lack of credible news reports": "The expert's investigation found no news reports to corroborate the claim that 59 people died after drinking Dettol in a church to prevent coronavirus. This lack of credible sources raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Deleted article": "The original article from Daily Sun, a leading English newspaper in Bangladesh, that supposedly reported the incident has been deleted from their website. This raises questions about the reliability of the information and casts doubt on the claim.", "Image from 2016": "The image accompanying the claim was found to have been originally posted in 2016 on the website of another Daily Sun, a newspaper in South Africa. The caption of the image suggests that it was unrelated to the alleged incident in the claim, further undermining its credibility.", "Company statement": "Dettol South Africa, through their verified Facebook account, issued a statement clarifying that their product is not for human consumption and urged anyone who drank it to consult a medical professional. This official statement from the company adds weight to the skepticism surrounding the claim."}
