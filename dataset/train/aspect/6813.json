{"Yard signs with the message": "The presence of yard signs displaying the claim about \"500 percent more traffic here\" in connection with a proposed Austin development on May 19, 2015, was observed by the expert. These signs were seen at the southwest corner of Spicewood Springs Road and MoPac Boulevard (Loop 1).", "Planned development details": "The initial plans of the redevelopment project at the mentioned location included the construction of three- to five-story buildings with up to 610 apartments and townhomes, as well as retail and restaurant space. The construction was planned to begin around 2020, after existing office leases expire.", "Lack of originator or sponsor": "The \"500%\" signs did not provide any information about the group or person responsible for creating them. A volunteer from a coalition opposing the redevelopment confirmed that their group did not create these signs.", "Traffic analysis and studies": "The expert discovered a September 2014 presentation by a city planner, Jim Duncan, which mentioned a traffic projection based on an engineering report commissioned by the developer. This report indicated a potential 478 percent increase in daily car trips near the proposed Austin Oaks Planned Use Development. Additionally, the expert received two traffic studies for the project, dated a year apart, from city officials. These studies were conducted to evaluate the traffic impact of the proposed development."}
