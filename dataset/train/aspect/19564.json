{"Rep": "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's financial disclosure reports: The expert mentions that Ocasio-Cortez has filed two financial disclosure reports with the House, both of which show little or no net worth. The reports provide concrete evidence of her financial situation and contradict the claim of her net worth being over $1 million.", "Specific asset and liability ranges": "The expert highlights that members of Congress are required to disclose ranges of their assets and liabilities in their financial disclosure reports. Ocasio-Cortez's reports indicate assets ranging from $2,003 to $31,000 and liabilities ranging from $15,001 to $50,000. These specific ranges further support the expert's verdict that her net worth is not over $1 million.", "Congressional salary": "The expert mentions that Ocasio-Cortez has been paid $174,000 per year as a member of Congress since January 2019. This information suggests that her salary alone is insufficient to accumulate a net worth of over $1 million, further undermining the claim.", "Lack of evidence supporting the claim": "The expert refers to a text image widely shared on Facebook, which asserts that Ocasio-Cortez's net worth is over $1 million. However, the expert's analysis of Ocasio-Cortez's financial disclosure reports and salary contradicts this claim, indicating a lack of credible evidence to support the assertion."}
