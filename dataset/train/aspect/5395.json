{"The claim is based on a statement made by Travis County Sheriff Sally Hernandez": "who argued that sanctuary cities have lower crime rates than other cities. This statement was supported by four other sheriffs from Dallas, Harris, Bexar, and El Paso counties.", "The claim refers to FBI crime statistics that supposedly support the assertion that sanctuary cities experience lower rates of all crime types": "including homicides. However, upon investigation, there was no such FBI report found to validate this claim.", "A study conducted by researchers at the University of California at Riverside and Highline College found that sanctuary policies did not have an impact on crime rates": "including violent crime, property crime, and rape. This study contradicts the claim made by the sheriffs.", "The claim also references a report by the Center for American Progress": "which states that crime in 2015 was significantly lower in 608 \"sanctuary\" counties compared to counties where law enforcement complied more with requests from Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials. This report suggests that focusing on community safety rather than federal immigration enforcement efforts can lead to safer communities and stronger economies."}
