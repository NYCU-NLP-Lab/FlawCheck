{"The claim originated from a warning post on social media": "specifically Facebook, stating that human traffickers use the zip tie stratagem to abduct strangers.", "The towns mentioned in the post": "Bryan and College Station, are located in Texas, USA, not Canada, which contradicts the claim.", "Fact": "checking website Snopes reported that a similar version of the post appeared in the San Angelo, Texas area in October 2018, and local police officially dispelled the tale at that time.", "Local police in College Station": "Texas, also released an official statement addressing citizens' concerns about the claim, stating that the connection between zip ties on cars and human traffickers is \"extremely unlikely.\" They advised people to be aware of their surroundings and report suspicious activity instead."}
