{"Lack of direct evidence": "The expert points out that there were no reports or accounts from neighbors themselves stating that they had knowledge of the San Bernardino shooters planning an attack. The only information available is second-hand reports from a neighbor who heard from another neighbor about suspicious activity.", "Focus on the wrong neighbors": "The expert highlights that the reports mentioned by Christie and sourced from right-leaning news websites were about the neighbors of Farook's mother in Redlands, not the neighbors of Farook and Malik themselves. This raises questions about the relevance and accuracy of the information presented.", "No mention of attack plans": "Despite Christie's claim that the neighbors knew about the shooters' intentions to attack the country, the expert states that no one was reported as saying they believed an attack was being planned. This contradicts Christie's assertion and undermines the authenticity of the claim.", "Descriptions of the shooters": "The expert mentions that neighbors and friends described Farook and Malik as \"quiet, religious people who didn't attract attention or suspicion.\" This characterization contradicts the idea that the neighbors were aware of their intentions to attack the country, further undermining the credibility of the claim."}
