{"The claim was sourced from a release by the National Partnership for Women": "Families, a Washington-based think tank focusing on women's issues. The release stated that in Florida, on average, women who hold a full-time job are paid $33,823 per year, while men who hold a full-time job are paid $40,951 per year. This translates to women in Florida being paid 83 cents for every dollar paid to men.", "The data used to support the claim was derived from the 2011 American Community Survey conducted by the U": "S. Census Bureau. This survey estimated median annual earnings for men and women who worked full-time, year-round over the prior 12 months.", "The expert also mentioned that the data used by the claim had been revised in an April 2014 release by the same think tank": "The updated numbers from the 2012 Census survey estimates indicated that women in Florida were making 84 cents on the dollar, slightly higher than the figure mentioned in the claim.", "The expert compared the claim to national figures": "stating that nationally, the gap between men and women's earnings was about 77 cents according to Census data, while the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported that women make 82 percent of what men make. This comparison suggests that the wage gap in Florida is slightly narrower than the national average."}
