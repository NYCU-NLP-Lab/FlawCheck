{"The claim is supported by a television commercial featuring two women": "Dawn and Alex, discussing Mitt Romney's stance on reproductive issues. The commercial includes statements from both women expressing their belief that Romney opposes requiring employers to cover contraception and would eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood.", "The claim is further supported by video footage of Mitt Romney himself stating his opposition to funding for Planned Parenthood": "The ad includes clips of Romney saying, \"I\u2019ll cut off funding for Planned Parenthood\" and \"Planned Parenthood. We\u2019re going to get rid of that.\"", "The claim is verified through Romney": "s stance on contraceptive coverage during the Republican primaries. It is mentioned that Romney expressed his support for the Blunt amendment, which would exempt employers from providing services that go against their \"beliefs or moral convictions.\" This aligns with the claim that Romney opposes requiring employers to cover contraception.", "The claim is also backed by the fact that the ad is being aired in several states": "indicating that the Obama campaign sees an opportunity to target women voters and believes that Romney's stance on reproductive issues could be a potential weakness for him. This suggests that the claim is strategically employed to appeal to a specific demographic."}
