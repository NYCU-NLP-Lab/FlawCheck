{"Lack of evidence for the claim": "The expert's verdict states that there is no evidence to support the claim of 15 homeless deaths in Chicago. This suggests that no official reports or credible sources have confirmed this information.", "Misleading use of an unrelated photograph": "The accompanying photograph used in the social media post is not from Chicago and is not even from the current year. The image was taken in Toronto in 2013 during a different winter event, indicating that it does not accurately depict the claim being made.", "Verification through fact": "checking: The expert's verdict mentions conducting a reverse-image search, which revealed that the photograph was uploaded to other websites starting in February 2013. This fact-checking process helped confirm that the image was not recent or related to the claim.", "Multiple deaths reported": "but not among the homeless in Chicago: While the extreme cold blast did result in deaths across multiple states, including the Chicago area, none of these deaths were among Chicago's homeless population. The expert's verdict highlights that the reported deaths were due to various causes, such as car crashes, exposure, and accidents, but they did not involve homeless individuals. This aspect helps debunk the claim made in the social media post."}
