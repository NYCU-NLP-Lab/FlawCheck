{"The claim is based on a statement made by GOP Lt": "Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch during a TV interview in which she accused Democratic recall opponent Mahlon Mitchell of sending a letter encouraging a boycott of over 100 companies.", "The expert": "s verdict states that the letter in question was provided by Kleefisch's campaign manager, Rachel Pecor, as evidence to support the claim. The letter was dated March 10, 2011, and signed by Mitchell and six other public employee union leaders.", "The letter was addressed to Tom Ellis": "the president of M&I Bank (now acquired by BMO Financial Group), who was identified as a campaign contributor to Gov. Scott Walker. The letter demanded that M&I Bank publicly oppose Walker's reform law, which limited collective bargaining rights for most state and local government employees.", "The letter threatened that if M": "I Bank did not comply with the demands, the signers would publicly and formally boycott the goods and services provided by the company. While M&I Bank is a single business, it had well over 100 branches in Wisconsin, which could be interpreted as the basis for the claim that Mitchell encouraged a boycott of over 100 companies."}
