{"Comparison of actual vaccination rates before and after Biden took office": "The expert highlighted that on the day Biden was inaugurated, the U.S. was already administering nearly 1.5 million shots, which was close to the pace Biden set as his goal. This comparison verifies the claim by showing that the goal was not a significant increase from the existing rate.", "Achievement of the 1 million doses per day average": "The expert mentioned that by Biden's second day in office, the seven-day average was already at the 1 million doses per day average needed to meet his 100-day goal. This aspect confirms the claim by demonstrating that the administration was on track to achieve the target.", "Initial perception of the goal as ambitious": "The expert referred to a New York Times story that described Biden's goal as \"ambitious\" and stated that fulfilling it would require no hiccups in vaccine manufacturing and distribution, as well as a willingness from Americans to be vaccinated. This aspect supports the claim by acknowledging that the goal was perceived as challenging but achievable.", "Misleading representation of vaccination rates": "The expert pointed out that Biden's speech on December 29th ignored the upward trend in vaccination rates. The CDC reported that 686,411 vaccines were administered that day, which was a significant increase compared to the initial daily average. This aspect challenges the claim by highlighting the misleading representation of vaccination rates and the need for a more accurate assessment."}
