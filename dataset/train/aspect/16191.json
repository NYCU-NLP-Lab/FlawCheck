Spokespersons for both Democratic Governor Roy Cooper and the Republican state Senate leader confirm that North Carolinians are allowed to wear masks and carry concealed weapons, contradicting the claim.", "North Carolina": "s General Statute 14-12.7, which forbids adults from concealing their identities in public, does not mention guns at all and was originally passed to target the Ku Klux Klan.", "The mask law in North Carolina": "which was suspended in May due to the coronavirus pandemic, allows individuals wearing masks for the purpose of ensuring their own or others' physical health or safety to be exempt from the state law prohibiting masks in public. Experts do not anticipate conflicts between mask laws and concealed carry laws, as there is no specific statute treating carrying a concealed weapon while masked differently from any other activity while masked."}
