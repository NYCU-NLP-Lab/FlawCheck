{"The expert mentions that media organizations did not call the 2016 election for Hillary Clinton": "who ultimately lost to Donald Trump. This indicates that the claim is not accurate.", "The expert highlights a Facebook post that claims the media got it wrong in previous elections": "including 2016. This suggests that there is a perception that the media's predictions or projections can be unreliable.", "The expert explains that the media": "calls\" races for candidates based on available information about the ballots cast for each candidate. This implies that the media's declaration of a winner is a projection rather than a definitive outcome.", "The expert provides historical examples of instances where the media incorrectly called election results": "such as the Chicago Daily Tribune wrongly declaring Thomas Dewey as the winner in 1948 and news outlets initially calling Florida for Al Gore in 2000.
