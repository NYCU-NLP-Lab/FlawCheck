{"Research study from Cornell University": "The expert mentions that the claim is based on a research study conducted by Cornell University. This aspect verifies the authenticity of the claim as it suggests that the claim is supported by scientific research.", "Energy loss of 29 percent": "The expert mentions that the Cornell University study concludes that ethanol generates a 29 percent energy loss. This aspect verifies the authenticity of the claim by providing a specific percentage that supports the claim's statement about the energy loss in ethanol production.", "Comparison to gasoline": "The claim states that it takes more than a gallon of gasoline to produce a gallon of ethanol. The expert's verdict mentions this aspect, which further verifies the authenticity of the claim by comparing the energy efficiency of ethanol production to that of gasoline.", "Inclusion of various energy inputs": "The expert mentions that the Cornell University study considered multiple \"energy inputs\" required to produce ethanol from corn, such as the production of pesticides, nitrogen fertilizer, construction of farm equipment, and food for farmworkers. This aspect verifies the authenticity of the claim by highlighting the comprehensive analysis conducted in the study to determine the energy balance of ethanol production."}
