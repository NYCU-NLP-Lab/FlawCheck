{"The claim is based on a statement made by State Sen": "Don Huffines, R-Dallas, who cited a research report by the Texas Taxpayers and Research Association (TTARA) and the Council on State Taxation (COST) as the source of the data.", "The research report by TTARA and COST states that businesses in Texas pay 61": "5 percent of the total state and local taxes, which includes property taxes. This figure is slightly higher than a previous fact check in 2013, which found that businesses were paying roughly 60 percent of all state and local taxes.", "The report does not provide a specific breakdown of the business share of property taxes alone": "but it does mention that Texas had the largest dollar increase in business property tax revenue in fiscal year 2015, collecting $1.3 billion more than the previous year.", "The expert": "s verdict also highlights that verifying the claim was not a straightforward calculation, indicating that determining the exact percentage of property taxes paid by businesses in Texas is challenging."}
