{"The video was originally tweeted by Tarek Fatah with a claim that Muslims in Rajasthan were waving Pakistani flags to celebrate Congress": "victory in the state. This claim was widely shared on social media platforms.", "Tarek Fatah later deleted his tweet and reposted a different version": "changing the phrase \"Pakistan flags\" to \"green Islamic flags.\" This raised questions about the accuracy of the claim and the authenticity of the video.", "Politics Solitics": "a Facebook page, also shared the same video with a message congratulating Congress-supporting Hindu brothers. This suggests that the video was being used to promote a particular narrative and may not accurately represent the events in Rajasthan.", "The Quint": "a news outlet, reported that the video actually belonged to Uttar Pradesh and not Rajasthan. They also mentioned that the flags seen in the video were representative of the 'Indian Union Muslim League' and not Pakistani flags. This information further cast doubt on the authenticity of the claim."}
