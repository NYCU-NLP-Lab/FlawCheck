{"Factual inaccuracy": "The expert points out that President Trump inaccurately stated that the current growth rate of the gross domestic product (GDP) is 3.2 percent. The most recent growth number, for the first quarter of 2018, was actually 2.0 percent.", "Misunderstanding of statistical measurement": "The expert highlights that President Trump seems to misunderstand the statistical measurement he is citing. He confuses 3 percent growth during a single quarter with 3 percent growth sustained over an entire year.", "Historical context": "The expert provides historical data to show that sustained 3 percent annual growth in the U.S. economy has not been achieved since 2005. This challenges President Trump's claim that \"nobody thought\" such growth was possible.", "Expert opinion": "The expert includes a statement from economist Tara Sinclair, who explains that economists do not expect consistent 3 percent annual growth in the U.S. economy due to demographics and current productivity numbers. This further questions the feasibility of President Trump's claim."}
