However, it was noted that the Trump administration had options in place to order more from these companies as well.", "The Trump administration had also contracted for additional doses from other companies": "but the plan depended on those vaccines receiving FDA authorization. This indicates that the previous administration had taken steps to secure a sufficient number of vaccine doses.", "The expert": "s verdict also mentioned that while President Biden claimed that America had no real plan to vaccinate most of the country before he took office, this was not entirely accurate.
