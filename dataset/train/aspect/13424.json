{"The claim is supported by a statement from the comic strip": "Doonesbury\" which mentions the CIA outsourcing the design and implementation of its torture program, and specifically mentions the involvement of two psychologists, Dr. Jessen and Dr. Mitchell, who were paid $81 million for their work.", "The claim is verified by a report from the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence": "which states that the CIA contracted with two psychologists to develop, operate, and assess its interrogation operations. The report also confirms that the psychologists formed a company specifically for this purpose and received $81 million prior to the termination of the contract in 2009.", "The Los Angeles Times reached out to one of the psychologists": "James Mitchell, who rejected the committee's description of his work and stated that much of what was written in the Senate report is taken out of context. This provides additional evidence of the psychologists' involvement in the CIA's torture program.", "The creator of the comic strip": "Garry Trudeau, referred to a Wikipedia link as a source for the claim. While Wikipedia is not always considered a reliable source, the fact that the claim aligns with information from the Senate report and the statement from James Mitchell adds credibility to its authenticity."}
