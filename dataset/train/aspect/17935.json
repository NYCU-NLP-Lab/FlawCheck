{"Sen": "Don Gaetz voted in favor of the septic tank inspection requirement twice, contradicting his claim that he fought against it.", "Gaetz stated that he was misled about the inspection requirement": "but there is no evidence to support this claim.", "The septic tank inspection requirement was not a last": "minute surprise bill, as Gaetz suggested. It was part of a larger conservation proposal that went through the necessary committees and received support from most senators.", "Gaetz": "s assertion that Tallahassee pulled a fast one and he fought back is partially true, but it overlooks the fact that he initially supported the inspections and only later campaigned for their repeal."}
