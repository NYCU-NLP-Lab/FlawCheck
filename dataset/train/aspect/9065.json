{"Verification of the source": "The expert reviewed the source of the claim, which was a website called sciencearticle.website. They found that the website had a history of publishing false information and hoaxes, indicating a lack of credibility.", "Analysis of accompanying photos": "The expert examined the photos included in the article, which showed large rats held by sanitation workers and lying on a table. Through reverse-image searches, they discovered that one photo was from a National Geographic gallery on giant swamp rats, which are not found in New York City. Another photo was altered to make it appear like a news broadcast, but the fake logo and website link indicated fabrication.", "Expert opinion from health department": "The expert reached out to the city's health department to gather information about the claim. A health department spokeswoman confirmed that the story was a hoax and clarified that the largest rats in New York City are Norway rats, which are much smaller in size and pose no threat to humans.", "Lack of reports on rat attacks": "The expert found that the health department had not received any reports of rat attacks, further debunking the claim. This lack of evidence supported the conclusion that the story was false."}
