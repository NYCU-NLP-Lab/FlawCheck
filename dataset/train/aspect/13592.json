{"The claim inaccurately states that": "deep, automatic cuts\" to Medicare could be made by \"unelected Washington bureaucrats.\" The expert's verdict clarifies that these cuts are not expected to be implemented until 2023 and would only amount to a small percentage of Medicare growth that year.", "The ads use scare tactics by warning of cuts that could": "restrict access to doctors\" and \"deny care,\" without providing any specific details about what the cost-cutting measures would entail.", "The ads are funded by Majority Forward": "a 501(c)(4) organization affiliated with the Senate Majority PAC, and are airing in Montana, North Dakota, and Indiana to support Democratic senators Jon Tester, Heidi Heitkamp, and Joe Donnelly. The ads claim that these senators are working to stop the cuts and have co-sponsored legislation to do so.", "The ads fail to mention that the reductions to Medicare growth are still several years away and are referring to the Independent Payment Advisory Board": "IPAB), which was created by the Affordable Care Act. The IPAB has been the target of criticism and calls for its repeal, with some referring to it as a \"death panel\" and others criticizing it as \"unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats.\" However, fiscal groups such as The Concord Coalition and the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget have supported the IPAB as a necessary measure to control healthcare costs."}
