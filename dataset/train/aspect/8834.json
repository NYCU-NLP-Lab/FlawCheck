{"Misreading of U": "S. Postal Service data: The expert's verdict highlights that the 27% figure mentioned in the claim is based on a misinterpretation of the USPS data. This suggests that the claim's basis is flawed and lacks authenticity.", "USPS skipping steps to expedite ballot delivery": "The expert mentions that the USPS had acknowledged skipping some steps in order to ensure faster delivery of ballots to election offices. This information contradicts the claim that the USPS failed to deliver 27% of mail-in ballots, indicating that the claim is not accurate.", "Verification by local officials": "The expert states that officials from the two largest counties in South Florida, Broward and Miami-Dade, visited postal facilities to ensure that every ballot was received. This verification process conducted by local officials adds credibility to the conclusion that the claim is not true.", "Confirmation from postal service representatives": "The expert cites statements from representatives of the postal service, including lawyers and the National Association of Letter Carriers chief of staff. These representatives affirm that the ballots were not undelivered but were directly pulled out from the rest of the mail and delivered on the same day. This confirmation further discredits the claim's authenticity."}
