{"Rep": "Debbie Wasserman Schultz's claim that \"40% of Americans know someone who has been killed by a gun\" was made in a Medium post where she expressed the need for stricter gun legislation to prevent future gun violence fatalities.", "The 40": "figure was sourced from an October 2015 Huffington Post article that cited a YouGov poll. YouGov is an online market research organization that conducted a survey of 1,000 U.S. adults selected through a random sample stratified by age, gender, race, education, and region.", "The survey asked participants if they personally knew anyone who had been killed by another person with a gun": "22% of respondents answered yes, with 6% saying the person was in their family and the remaining 16% saying it was someone else they knew.", "The survey also asked participants if they personally knew anyone who had committed suicide using a gun": "28% of participants answered yes, with 7% knowing a family member who used a gun to commit suicide and 21% saying they knew someone else who committed suicide with a gun. The 40% figure mentioned in the claim takes into account the overlap between respondents who knew both a homicide and a suicide victim."}
