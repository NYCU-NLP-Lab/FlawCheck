{"Inaccurate claim": "The expert's verdict highlights that the claim of 18 million illegal immigrants receiving benefit checks during the government shutdown is factually inaccurate. This is based on the expert's knowledge of the number of undocumented immigrants in the United States and their ineligibility for most government benefits.", "Source identification": "The expert identifies the initial source of the claim as a Facebook post by \"Miles Dalton\" on January 20, 2019. The post had limited shares, but verbatim copies were found on numerous other social media accounts. This helps establish the origin of the claim and its subsequent spread.", "Data from credible sources": "The expert refers to data from reputable sources such as the Pew Research Center and the Department of Homeland Security to provide accurate statistics on the number of unauthorized immigrants in the United States. This data contradicts the claim of 18 million illegal immigrants receiving benefit checks.", "Ineligibility for government benefits": "The expert explains that undocumented immigrants, including DACA holders, are generally ineligible for most federal public benefits. They are not eligible for means-tested benefits like SNAP, Medicaid, SSI, TANF, or health care subsidies under the ACA. This further discredits the claim of illegal immigrants receiving government checks during the shutdown."}
