{"Time period": "The expert notes that the claim refers to the past 12 months, but the most recent data available from the Metropolitan Police Service is only until December 2018. This raises questions about the accuracy of the claim.", "Actual knife crime statistics": "The expert mentions that during the calendar year of 2018, there were 14,700 recorded knife crimes in London, which is more than what the Facebook post claims. This contradicts the claim's assertion that 13,000 knife attacks were committed in London in the past 12 months.", "Offenders": "demographics: The expert highlights that the claim specifically implicates Muslim immigrants as responsible for the majority of knife attacks in London. However, the expert points out that a police analysis cited in a knife crime plan does not mention Muslims or immigrants as offenders. Instead, it states that almost 90 percent of offenders were male, and of those, 62 percent had black, Asian, and other minority ethnic backgrounds.", "Lack of data on offenders": "religion and immigration status: The expert mentions that a public information request seeking information about the religion, ethnicity, and immigration status of offenders in 2018 was not immediately answered by the Metropolitan Police Service. Additionally, the police spokesman confirms that such information is not released by the service. This lack of data further questions the claim's assertion about the religious and immigration backgrounds of the offenders."}
