{"Testimony from Ramey Ko": "Ramey Ko, a lawyer and prospective Texas House candidate, claimed at a meeting of the Austin Young Democrats that some Austin schools lack electrical outlets in their classrooms. This firsthand testimony serves as one aspect of verifying the authenticity of the claim.", "Statement from Catherine Crago": "Catherine Crago, a board member of the Greater Austin Asian Chamber of Commerce, mentioned research she helped compile in the early 1990s that inventoried the features of Central Texas schools, including the number of outlets per classroom. While Crago did not specifically mention Austin district classrooms, her statement provides additional evidence to support the claim.", "Confirmation from Austin district representative": "According to Catherine Crago, at the same meeting where she mentioned the research on outlets per classroom, she asked an Austin district representative if the information was still true. Crago claims that the representative nodded yes, indicating that the lack of outlets could still be an issue in Austin schools. This confirmation from the district representative adds credibility to the claim.", "Lack of denial or contradiction": "The expert's verdict does not mention any denial or contradiction from the Austin school district regarding the claim of classrooms lacking electrical outlets. The absence of a response disputing the claim can be seen as another aspect supporting its authenticity."}
