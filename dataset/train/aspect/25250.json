{"Misinterpretation of the Novaya Gazeta article": "The claim of the \"Blue Whale\" suicide game causing over 130 suicides in Russia originated from a misinterpretation of a May 2016 article from the Russian site Novaya Gazeta. The article reported on suicides of children in Russia and mentioned a connection to an online game community, but did not definitively link the suicides to the game.", "Lack of definitive evidence": "Investigations by Radio Free Europe and other sources found no definitive evidence linking any suicides to the \"blue whale\" game. Despite the presence of profiles and self-injury photographs associated with the game, no deaths in Russia or Central Asia have been definitively tied to the game.", "Provisional links to suicides": "While there have been reports of dozens of suicides and attempted suicides provisionally linked to the game in Russia, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan, upon closer inspection, none of them have been found to have a conclusive tie to the \"blue whale\" game.", "Criticism of the Novaya Gazeta report": "The Novaya Gazeta report was highly criticized for its methodology and conclusions. Critics argued that the suicides may be more attributed to depressed or suicidal teenagers being drawn to the same social media groups, rather than the groups causing them to commit suicide. This criticism highlights the need for caution when interpreting the claims made in the Novaya Gazeta article."}
