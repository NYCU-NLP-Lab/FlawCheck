{"Historical evidence": "The expert mentions that they have collected examples of the list of howlers dating back to as far as 1998. This historical evidence helps verify the claim's authenticity by showing that similar stories have been circulating for a long time, indicating that it is not specific to current politicians.", "Comparison to earlier versions": "The expert notes that earlier versions of the list presented the geographically challenged individuals as \"a client,\" \"a secretary,\" \"a man,\" etc., rather than members of Congress. This comparison helps verify the claim by showing that the stories have been modified to target politicians specifically, indicating a possible political bias or agenda.", "Change in preface": "The expert points out that earlier versions of the list were presented as \"Actual stories from a variety of Travel Agents,\" while the modified version is presented as \"Actual stories provided by a retiring Washington, D.C. travel agent of 30+ years.\" This change in preface suggests a deliberate repositioning of the stories to give them more credibility and authenticity.", "Specific examples": "The expert provides specific examples of the howlers allegedly made by members of Congress, such as a congresswoman asking for an aisle seat to protect her hair from the window's wind or a congressman's staffer confusing Cape Cod with Capetown. These specific examples help verify the claim by providing concrete evidence of the alleged geographical ignorance displayed by members of Congress."}
