{"Statements from David Alameel": "The expert's verdict mentions multiple statements made by David Alameel, the Democratic U.S. Senate nominee in Texas, where he claims that John Cornyn dodged the draft during the Vietnam War. These statements provide the initial basis for the claim and contribute to the assessment of its authenticity.", "Confirmation of student deferment": "The expert's verdict mentions that John Cornyn's campaign confirmed that he had a student deferment during his college years. This confirmation adds credibility to the claim as it aligns with the practice of seeking and receiving student deferments during that era.", "Historical context of draft deferments": "The expert's verdict highlights the historical context of draft deferments during the Vietnam War. It mentions that more than 2 million college-going men, including John Cornyn, sought and received student deferments to legally avoid military service. This context provides evidence that supports the claim of Cornyn's draft avoidance.", "Selective Service System information": "The expert's verdict includes information from the Selective Service System, stating that men who received a draft notice had the opportunity to request a hearing for a deferment. This information suggests that John Cornyn, like many others, had the opportunity to claim a deferment if he was eligible for it, further supporting the claim of his draft avoidance."}
