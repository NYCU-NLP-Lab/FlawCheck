{"The claim is based on the testimony of a U": "S. Postal Service contractor named Ethan Pease, who alleges that USPS workers told him about 100,000 \"missing\" ballots and a move to backdate them.", "The claim is being promoted by conservative news outlets and personalities": "including President Donald Trump, as part of an ongoing effort to discredit and overturn election results in Wisconsin.", "The backdating claims": "even if true, would not have affected the Wisconsin election results, as absentee ballots had to be received by the time polls closed on Election Day to be counted.", "The Wisconsin deadline for ballot counting is based on when the ballots are received": "not when they are postmarked, making it impossible for backdated ballots to be counted."}
