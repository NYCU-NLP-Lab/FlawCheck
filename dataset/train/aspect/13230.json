{"The photograph": "s source and credibility: The expert verified that the photograph was originally shared by marine biologist Jimmy Bernot, a reputable scientist specializing in crustacean phylogeny and parasite evolution. Bernot confirmed that he captured the photo during a scientific survey in Moreton Bay, Australia.", "The identification of the organism": "The expert identified the organism in the photograph as a cymothoid isopod, a type of marine parasite. The expert explained the characteristics of cymothoid isopods and their behavior, including their ability to attach to a fish's tongue and function as a pseudo tongue.", "Supporting evidence from tooth imprints": "The expert pointed out that tooth imprints on the back of the isopod in the photograph indicated that the fish was using the parasite in a similar way to how it would use its tongue. This provided additional evidence of the authenticity of the claim.", "Scientific research on cymothoid isopods": "The expert cited research published in the International Journal for Parasitology: Parasites and Wildlife, which provided information on the cymothoidae family of isopods. This research supported the existence and characteristics of cymothoid isopods as parasitic organisms."}
