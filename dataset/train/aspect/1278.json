{"The historical timeline": "The expert examined the claim by comparing the invention of the modern bicycle (19th century) with the age of the Panchavarnaswamy Temple (over 2,000 years old) to determine if the carving of a bicycle was plausible.", "Examination of temple records": "The expert referenced the 7th-century text called Tevaram, which mentions the temple, to establish its existence during ancient times and refute the argument that the temple was a recent construction.", "Renovation history": "The expert highlighted that specific portions of the temple were renovated about a hundred years ago, suggesting that the carving of the bicycle might have been added during that renovation period.", "Alternative explanation": "Another expert, Dr. R. Kalaikovan, provided an alternative explanation for the carving, stating that he discovered it on a pillar behind the Amman temple and that neither the officials nor the temple's historian could explain its presence."}
