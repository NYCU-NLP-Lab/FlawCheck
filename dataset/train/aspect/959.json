The fact that multiple individuals shared the same information on different platforms suggests a level of consistency and supports the claim.", "Visual evidence": "The expert's verdict mentions that local news channels, such as Arambagh TV and Anandabazar, ran videos showing stone-pelting during the incident. These videos provide visual evidence of the violence and can help verify the claim.", "Contradictory evidence": "The expert's verdict mentions that the Facebook post claimed TMCP members set ablaze motorcycles, but video footage shows individuals in saffron t-shirts setting the bikes on fire outside the campus.
