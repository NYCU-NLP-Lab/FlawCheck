{"Verification through primary and general election records": "The experts scrolled through internet archives, reached out to the state's political parties, and consulted a librarian to examine the primary and general election records of North Carolina Secretary of State Elaine Marshall. They found that she has been elected secretary of state seven times since 1996 and has also competed in U.S. Senate primaries.", "Comparison with other candidates": "The experts compared Elaine Marshall's statewide election victories with other prominent candidates in North Carolina. They found that Marshall's closest competitor in terms of statewide races won is Governor Roy Cooper, who has won six statewide races dating back to 2000.", "Consideration of all candidates living or dead": "The experts also took into account the possibility of other candidates, both living and deceased, who might have won more statewide races in North Carolina. They found that Elaine Marshall does not hold the record for winning the most statewide elections in the state. Thad Eure, who served as secretary of state for 53 years and won the position 13 times, likely holds that record. Former agriculture commissioner Jim Graham, with nine wins, appears to have won the second-most statewide races.", "Inclusion of primary elections": "While the experts primarily focused on general elections due to the difficulty of accessing official primary records, they did consider Elaine Marshall's performance in primary races. Including the three primaries she has won, Marshall appears to be tied for winning the most races for statewide office in North Carolina."}
