{"The images of the building with the Pakistani national flag were shared on social media platforms": "including Facebook and Twitter, with claims that it is the rooftop of Gurudwara Darbar Sahib Kartarpur.", "A Google reverse image search was conducted": "which led to the discovery that the building shown in the images is the immigration centre at the Kartarpur border. This information was verified through a report published by The Express Tribune.", "The immigration centre at the Kartarpur corridor is situated at a distance from Gurudwara Darbar Sahib Kartarpur": "as confirmed by Google Maps. This indicates that the flag on the rooftop does not belong to the gurudwara.", "The purpose of setting up the immigration centre was to maintain control and security on both sides of the border": "as stated by Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) Deputy Director Mufakhar Adeel.
