{"Creation of unofficial Facebook pages": "The expert's verdict mentions that the Facebook pages \"Embassy of Kenya Washington DC\" and \"Liberia Embassy in Washington DC\" are not official pages of the respective embassies. This indicates that the authenticity of the claim is questionable, as it originated from unofficial sources.", "Lack of activity on the Facebook pages": "The expert's verdict highlights that both Facebook pages were created on the same day as the posts were published and have had no other activity since then. This suggests that the pages were potentially created solely for the purpose of spreading the false information.", "Denial by the embassies": "The official embassies of both Kenya and Liberia have issued statements dismissing the announcements as false and fraudulent. Their statements contradict the claim made on the unofficial Facebook pages, further casting doubt on the authenticity of the claim.", "Warning against sending money": "The Kenyan embassy explicitly warns the public against sending money to the phone numbers provided in the posts. This indicates that there may be a scam or fraudulent activity associated with the claim, further undermining its credibility."}
