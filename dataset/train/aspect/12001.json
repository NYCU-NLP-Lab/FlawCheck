{"Longitudinal data": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim is based on longitudinal data, which indicates that the research has been conducted over a significant period of time to gather evidence and establish a correlation between Superfund sites and birth defects/autism rates.", "Superfund studies": "The expert's verdict states that Sen. Cory Booker's press team provided two Superfund studies to support the claim. These studies specifically focus on the association between toxic landfills and autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) as well as congenital anomalies (birth defects).", "Mapping of Superfund sites": "In the autism paper, researchers mapped the location of Superfund sites in New Jersey and found that cases of ASD appeared in higher frequency closer to these sites. This spatial analysis provides evidence of a potential link between the proximity of Superfund sites and the prevalence of autism.", "Expert opinions": "The expert's verdict mentions that they spoke to environmental health researchers who were unaffiliated with the studies. These experts expressed the difficulty in proving a causal relationship between being born near Superfund sites and the occurrence of birth defects or autism. This inclusion of expert opinions adds credibility to the assessment of the claim's authenticity."}
