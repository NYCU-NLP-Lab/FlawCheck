{"The total defense budgets for the last four fiscal years were examined": "which showed that the amount of money allocated for defense under Trump was nearly $2.7 trillion, slightly higher than his claim of $2.5 trillion.", "It was found that not all of the allocated money had been spent": "as Trump included the $738 billion approved in December 2020 in his cost estimate. These funds would take time to serve their purpose.", "Rebuilding the military would require significant time and resources": "including the development and acquisition of new equipment. It was unlikely that the funds allocated for 2020 had already been used for this purpose.", "Only a portion of the defense budget was dedicated to procurement": "with approximately $562.5 billion spent on buying and upgrading equipment. The remaining funds were allocated for research and development, military personnel, and operation and maintenance costs."}
