{"Comparison of average salaries": "The expert compared the average salaries of federal employees and private employees to verify the authenticity of the claim. They found that the average federal employee compensation, including salary and benefits, was $123,049, while the private-sector average was $61,051.", "Consideration of benefits": "The expert highlighted the importance of considering both salary and benefits when comparing federal and private-sector pay. They found that when benefits were excluded, the average salary of federal civilian employees was $81,258, compared to $50,464 for private-sector workers.", "Explanation of phrasing": "The expert pointed out that the phrasing used by the claimant, stating that the average federal employee makes $120,000 a year, was problematic. They clarified that the $120,000 figure included both salary and benefits, which may have misled people into thinking it referred to salary alone.", "Consideration of job types": "The expert mentioned that there is an imbalance in the types of jobs between the federal workforce and the private-sector workforce. They noted that the federal workforce has a higher proportion of employees with higher educational attainment, which could contribute to the pay disparity between the two sectors."}
