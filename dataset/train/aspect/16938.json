{"The expert": "s statement: The expert stated that he has yet to see any incontrovertible proof that speed, in and of itself, is the contributing factor to increasing fatalities. This indicates that the authenticity of the claim is being questioned and requires further evidence to support it.", "Use of the 85th percentile rule": "Engineers determine the proper speed limit using the widely accepted 85th percentile rule, which states that the safest speed is the one at which 85 percent of drivers travel. This rule suggests that speed alone may not be the sole contributing factor to increasing fatalities.", "Input from public affairs officer": "The public affairs officer from the Florida Highway Patrol (FHP) stated that they reached out to other states that increased their speed limits and did not find a dramatic impact on the number of fatal crashes. This input provides evidence against the claim that increasing speed limits alone leads to more fatalities.", "Input from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety": "The vice president of communications of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety pointed to a 2002 study that found a correlation between higher speed limits and increased deaths per million vehicle miles traveled. However, he also acknowledged that speed is not the only cause of fatal accidents and that other factors exacerbate the risks associated with higher speeds. This suggests that while speed may contribute to fatalities, it is not the sole cause."}
