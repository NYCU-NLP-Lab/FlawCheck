{"Double": "counting votes and tallying tricks: The expert found that Mack's campaign double-counted votes and used tallying tricks to inflate the number of times Nelson voted for higher taxes. This included counting multiple votes on the same budget resolution and counting multiple votes on actual legislation as separate instances.", "Democratic budget resolutions": "The expert noted that about half of the votes on Mack's list were Democratic budget resolutions, which are non-binding and do not change tax law. Therefore, it was technically incorrect to say that these resolutions raised, lowered, or kept taxes the same.", "Opposing tax cuts vs": "voting to raise taxes: The expert pointed out that Mack's list included instances where Nelson opposed tax cuts, but opposing a tax cut does not necessarily mean voting to raise taxes. Some of these instances were minor, such as Nelson's vote to table an amendment to eliminate the medical device tax.", "Input from federal budget experts": "The expert mentioned that Mack's list was sent to three federal budget experts for analysis. This suggests that the authenticity of the claim was verified by consulting with knowledgeable individuals in the field."}
