By searching for highways running through Vadodara, Gujarat, they found a similar image on gujaratmoney.com, which conclusively established that the image shared by BJP Chhattisgarh was not from Chhattisgarh but from the Mumbai-Vadodara Expressway.", "The expert conducted another reverse image search on Google and found that the same photograph had been shared by other sources": "such as a News18 report from 2014 on the Delhi-Jaipur Highway and a 2016 Amar Ujala link captioned as \"Road in Chamba.\" This further undermined the authenticity of BJP Chhattisgarh's claim.", "The expert": "s analysis and verification process involved cross-referencing multiple sources and examining the details in the images to establish that the claim made by BJP Chhattisgarh was not accurate.
