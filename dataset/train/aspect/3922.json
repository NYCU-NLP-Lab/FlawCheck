{"The expert mentions that in 2017": "State Sen. Caleb Rowden voted for an amendment that fully funded K-12 education for the first time in the current formula's history. This aspect verifies the claim by providing evidence of a specific action taken by Rowden to support K-12 education funding.", "The expert explains that the previous formula used for K": "12 education funding was fully funded from 1994 to 2001. This aspect provides historical context and shows that while the claim may be true for the current formula, it may not be accurate for the entire history of K-12 education funding in Missouri.", "The expert mentions that Missouri": "s K-12 education is funded by a mix of local, state, and federal sources, with state sources accounting for about 40% of the total funds each year. This aspect highlights the complexity of education funding and emphasizes the importance of considering all funding sources when evaluating the claim.", "The expert states that to be considered fully funded": "the legislature has to meet the total dollar amount determined by the formula for K-12 education. This aspect emphasizes the importance of meeting the funding requirements set by the formula and suggests that simply passing an amendment may not be sufficient to fully fund K-12 education."}
