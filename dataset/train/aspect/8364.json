{"Rep": "Peter King's repeated statements: The expert's verdict highlights that Rep. Peter King has made multiple statements over the years claiming that the Islamic State attempted to attack Fort Knox. These statements serve as the initial source of the claim.", "Lack of evidence from credible sources": "The expert's investigation found that neither the Heritage Foundation nor the University of Maryland National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism have any records of an attempted attack on Fort Knox. This lack of evidence from reputable sources raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Absence of additional information from Rep": "Peter King's office: Despite multiple attempts to contact Rep. Peter King's office for more information, no response was received. The lack of additional details or evidence from King's office further undermines the claim's authenticity.", "Details of the 2011 arrest of two Iraqi nationals": "The expert's verdict mentions the 2011 arrest of two Iraqi nationals in western Kentucky on federal terrorism charges. While this event is not directly linked to an attempted attack on Fort Knox, it serves as the basis for Rep. Peter King's claim. The details of this arrest, including the involvement of the FBI and the alarming nature of the case, add some weight to the claim but do not provide conclusive evidence of an actual attack attempt on Fort Knox."}
