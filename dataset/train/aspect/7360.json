{"Lack of evidence": "The expert's verdict states that there is no evidence to support the claim that the Chinese military developed the 2019 coronavirus as a bioweapon. This highlights the importance of relying on factual evidence rather than speculation or conspiracy theories.", "Genetic similarity": "The expert mentions that there are dozens of viruses in a national database with genetic material similar to the coronavirus. This suggests that the genetic makeup of the coronavirus is not unique and does not necessarily indicate a military bio-weapon.", "Unreliable source": "The claim is based on an article from the Hal Turner Radio Show, which is known for promoting conspiracy theories. The expert's verdict emphasizes the need to critically evaluate the credibility of the source before accepting the claim as authentic.", "Inconclusive evidence": "The screenshots provided in the Hal Turner article, showing two entries in a database for coronavirus proteins, are deemed as inconclusive evidence. The expert explains that the presence of similar envelope proteins does not prove that the two viruses are the same, as there are multiple types of coronaviruses that can infect humans. This highlights the importance of considering all available evidence and not jumping to conclusions based on isolated data points."}
