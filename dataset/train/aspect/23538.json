{"The video was originally posted on Facebook by the page Trend Media": "with a caption stating that it was an inscription found on a bus in the UK. It has been shared by nearly 1,000 Facebook users and viewed over 12,000 times.", "Multiple versions of the video were shared on YouTube and Twitter": "indicating a wider circulation and potential manipulation.", "The video shows signs of being doctored": "such as the brightness of the white part of the sign and the absence of moving shadows, which would be expected if the sign was on a moving bus.", "Transport for London": "TfL), the authority that operates the bus network, confirmed that they do not allow overtly political advertising and have guidelines against promoting party political causes or electioneering. This suggests that the claim of the bus advert calling out election rigging is not authentic."}
