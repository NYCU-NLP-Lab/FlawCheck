Chan School of Public Health dismissed the claim, stating that it is \"completely fanciful and not evidence-based\" to believe the virus will go away without a vaccine.", "Lipsitch also mentioned that while it is theoretically possible for the virus to disappear with a large uncontrolled epidemic leading to permanent immunity": "it is highly unlikely due to the lack of evidence of permanent immunity in human coronaviruses and the presence of susceptible populations worldwide."}
