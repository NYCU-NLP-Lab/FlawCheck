{"Pelosi": "s claim is misleading because it implies that repealing the ACA would directly impact all Americans who get their health benefits through their workplace, when in reality the ACA primarily expanded coverage for the previously uninsured, not those already covered through employer-based insurance.", "The nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation estimates that in 2015": "49 percent of the total population had employer health insurance coverage, based on the Census Bureau's Current Population Survey for March. This figure contradicts Pelosi's claim of 75 percent.", "The Census Bureau": "s annual report found that in 2015, 55.7 percent of the population had employer-based insurance for part or all of the year. This figure also contradicts Pelosi's claim."}
