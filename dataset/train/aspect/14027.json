{"The image in question is from June 2016 and shows Michelle Obama receiving an honorary degree from City University of New York Chancellor James Milliken during a commencement speech": "This verifies that the image is not recent and does not depict her earning a doctorate after leaving the White House.", "Michelle Obama has been awarded several honorary degrees during her time as the first lady": "including an honorary doctorate of public health from Oregon State University in 2012 and an honorary doctorate of laws from Bowie State University in 2013. This demonstrates that she has received honorary degrees, but not a doctorate earned after leaving the White House.", "A spokesperson for Michelle Obama confirmed in June": "when a similar claim was circulating, that she had not earned any new degrees since leaving the White House. This statement contradicts the claim that she earned a doctorate after leaving the White House.", "The expert": "s verdict rates the claim as false and provides additional sources such as Popsugar, The Associated Press, and The White House to support their assessment. This indicates that there is no evidence to support the claim and that it has been debunked."}
