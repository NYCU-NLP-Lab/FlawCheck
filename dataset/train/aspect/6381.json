{"The Elton John AIDS Foundation provided evidence backing up the claim": "including a link to a Washington Post article from September 2014. The article quoted the then-executive director of the nonprofit Southern AIDS Coalition, who stated that Southern states have the highest rates of new HIV diagnoses, the largest percentage of people living with the disease, and the most people dying from it.", "The Southern HIV": "AIDS Strategy Initiative (SASI) published a report in November 2012, using 2010 data from the CDC and other government agencies. The report focused on nine states in the South that were particularly affected by HIV, and it found that these states had the highest rates of HIV diagnoses in the United States. The South, despite comprising only a third of the country's population, accounted for more than half of the new HIV diagnoses.", "The CDC data supported the claim by indicating that the South had the highest rates of HIV diagnoses in the country": "The report mentioned that nine out of the ten metropolitan areas with the highest HIV incidence rates were located in the South.", "The claim was further supported by the fact that the Elton John AIDS Foundation and the Southern AIDS Coalition": "both reputable organizations in the field, endorsed the claim and provided evidence to back it up."}
