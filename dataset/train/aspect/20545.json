{"Comparison to previous General Assemblies": "The expert compared the number of anti-women's choice bills introduced in the first half of the current session to those introduced in the last three General Assemblies. This involved analyzing data from previous sessions to determine if there was an increase in such bills.", "Identification of specific legislation": "The expert provided specific examples of bills that would restrict abortion rights, such as HB 125 and HB 153. By listing these bills, the expert demonstrated the existence of legislation targeting women's choice in the current session.", "Verification of the provided list": "The expert and PolitiFact Ohio independently checked the list of anti-abortion legislation provided by State Rep. Armond Budish's office. This involved using the search engine for laws, acts, and legislation on the legislature's website to confirm the inclusion of the identified bills.", "Comparison of bill numbers across General Assemblies": "The expert compared the number of bills affecting abortion rights in the current session (11) to the number of bills in the three previous two-year sessions (8 in the 128th General Assembly, 9 in the 127th, and 6 in the 126th). This comparison helped establish the claim's authenticity by showing an increase in the number of bills related to women's choice."}
