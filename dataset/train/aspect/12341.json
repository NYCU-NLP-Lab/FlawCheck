{"Anachronistic dating of the report": "The expert points out that the dating of the report appears to be anachronistic. The term \"horseless carriage\" was not commonly used until the 1890s, while the report claims to be from 1875. This raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Lack of historical evidence": "The expert mentions that they checked \"Committees in the U.S. Congress\" and verified that there was no \"Horseless Carriage Committee\" as mentioned in the claim. This lack of historical evidence casts doubt on the existence of the committee and the authenticity of the report.", "Satirical nature of the claim": "The expert suggests that the claim could be a modern piece of satire intended to highlight the exaggerated fears of 19th-century citizens about new technologies. This aspect raises the possibility that the claim is not a genuine historical document but rather a satirical creation.", "Contradictory content": "The content of the purported report itself raises questions about its authenticity. The report expresses concerns about the dangers of gasoline-powered vehicles, including fire hazards and their potential impact on the environment. However, these concerns are presented in an exaggerated manner, suggesting that they may be intended to ridicule or satirize the fears associated with new technologies. This contradiction further undermines the credibility of the claim."}
