{"Lack of credible sources": "The expert points out that the only publication reporting on the discovery of 22 dead bodies in the Flint River is a disreputable, clickbait fake news site. This lack of credible sources raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Contradictory information": "The expert mentions that officials have not blamed the river's contaminated water on the presence of corpses. This contradicts the claim that the dead bodies were the source of pollution in the Flint River.", "Inconsistencies in the article": "The expert highlights that the image used in the article is unrelated to the claimed event. The photograph was taken from a news report about a murder in Philadelphia, not the search for dead bodies in the Flint River. This inconsistency further undermines the credibility of the claim.", "Lack of mainstream coverage": "The expert notes that if the claim were true, it would have been major news considering the significance of the Flint water crisis. However, there is no mention of this discovery in any reputable news sources, suggesting that it is not a verifiable event."}
