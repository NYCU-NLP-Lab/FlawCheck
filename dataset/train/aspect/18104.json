{"The claim is based on a paper written by researchers in S\u00e3o Paulo": "Brazil, which suggests that a woman likely contracted HIV from her cousin by sharing manicure equipment. This paper was published in the journal AIDS Research and Human Retroviruses.", "The woman did not contract HIV": "during a manicure\" as the claim suggests. The description caused unwarranted fears about visiting nail salons. The researchers did not assert the method of transmission as a certainty.", "The claim originated from a 2015 article published on the Filipino website TheAsianParent": "which reported that a 22-year-old Brazilian woman was diagnosed with HIV after getting a manicure using shared equipment. The case attracted widespread media attention in 2014, including articles by Fox News and the New York Daily News.", "The woman had none of the usual risk factors associated with contracting HIV": "such as having unprotected sex or sharing infected needles. However, further investigation revealed that she had shared manicure instruments with a cousin who was later found to be HIV-positive, suggesting a possible transmission route. Blood analysis also suggested that the woman had been infected with the virus around 10 years ago."}
