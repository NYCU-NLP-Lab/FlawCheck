{"Lack of official issuance": "The expert's verdict states that the poster claiming to be the Independence Day 2020 safety guidelines issued by the state of Maryland was not actually issued by the Maryland governor's office. This lack of official issuance raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Bizarre and harsh rules": "The expert's verdict mentions that the poster contains some pretty bizarre and harsh rules for July 4th festivities, such as limiting citizens to only two sparklers, holding sparklers at a specific angle, and prohibiting all other fireworks. These unusual rules add to the suspicion surrounding the claim.", "Inconsistencies with official guidelines": "The Maryland State Fire Marshal released a statement confirming that the notice is fake and that the governor's office did not issue any specific directives regarding sparklers or limited outdoor celebration time. This contradiction between the fake poster and the official guidelines further undermines the authenticity of the claim.", "Lack of evidence on official platforms": "The expert's investigation found no official 2020 safety guidelines for July 4th on the Maryland state government website. Additionally, the Maryland State Fire Marshal's statement emphasizes the need to follow the latest CDC guidelines on social distancing, rather than the specific rules mentioned in the fake poster. The absence of any evidence or mention of the claim on official platforms casts doubt on its authenticity."}
