{"Lack of evidence in official records": "The expert's verdict mentions that the alleged tweet from President Trump was not found in his Twitter timeline, databases tracking deleted tweets, or any other evidence suggesting its existence.", "Inconsistencies in content and style": "The expert's verdict highlights that the purported tweet contained spelling errors, which is unusual for official statements from the President. This discrepancy in language and style raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Contradictory topic and context": "The alleged tweet discussed personal sacrifices made by President Trump to be in office, while Memorial Day is traditionally observed to honor the sacrifices of service members who died in service to their country. The expert's verdict points out that President Trump's actual tweets on that day were related to different topics, such as mail-in ballots and playing golf during the pandemic. This contradiction casts doubt on the claim's authenticity.", "Fabrication and lack of corroboration": "The expert's verdict explicitly states that the image of the tweet was a fabrication. The claim was not supported by any evidence, such as retweets or mentions on the Twitter platform, further undermining its authenticity."}
