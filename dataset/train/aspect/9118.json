{"Estimates of undocumented workers paying federal income taxes": "The expert's verdict mentions that there is no official count of how many undocumented workers pay federal income taxes, but it is an educated assumption that many experts use. This aspect highlights the reliance on estimates to determine the number of undocumented workers contributing to federal income taxes.", "Social Security contributions": "The Social Security Administration estimated that in 2009, 3.1 million unauthorized workers paid into Social Security via payroll tax, even though they may not be eligible to collect those benefits. This aspect demonstrates one way in which undocumented workers contribute to federal income taxes.", "Use of Individual Taxpayer Identification Number": "ITIN): Undocumented immigrants who are unable to obtain Social Security numbers can use an ITIN to pay income taxes. In 2013, 4.3 million people filed tax returns using ITINs, contributing $9 billion in payroll taxes in 2014. This aspect highlights the role of ITINs in enabling undocumented immigrants to fulfill their tax obligations.", "Growth in ITIN usage": "The expert mentions that the number of people signing up for ITINs and paying taxes that way has grown over the past few years.

This aspect emphasizes the increasing trend of undocumented workers contributing to federal income taxes."}
