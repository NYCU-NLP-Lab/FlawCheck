{"Verification of the debt increase": "The expert checked the U.S. government's Treasury Direct website to track the national debt from the time Sheldon Whitehouse took office to the date the video was posted. The expert found that the debt increased by $6.56 trillion, not \"almost $8 trillion\" as claimed.", "Projection of future debt increase": "The expert used the yearly increase in the national debt for the past five years to project the debt by January 2013 when Whitehouse's first term would expire. The projected range was from $7.5 trillion to $8.9 trillion, supporting the claim of \"almost $8 trillion\" debt increase.", "Comparison with federal budget prediction": "The federal budget for 2012 predicted that by September 30, the gross federal debt would be $16.6 trillion, which is $8 trillion more than when Whitehouse took office. This aligns with the claim made in the video.", "Attribution of debt increase to Whitehouse": "s leadership: The expert reached out to the Hinckley campaign to understand how Whitehouse could be held responsible for the debt increase. The campaign issued a statement suggesting that Whitehouse had not made a difference in controlling the debt and had compliantly increased it, implying a failure of leadership."}
