{"False confessions": "The expert's verdict states that evidence suggests the young men made false confessions that they later recanted. This indicates that their initial admission of guilt may not have been authentic.", "Lack of physical evidence": "The prosecution's case against the Central Park Five relied heavily on the defendants' statements, as there was no physical or forensic evidence connecting them to the attack. This undermines the authenticity of their supposed admission of guilt.", "Exoneration and new evidence": "The expert's verdict mentions that the Central Park Five have been exonerated, implying that new evidence emerged after their conviction that disproved their guilt. This suggests that their initial admission of guilt may have been incorrect or coerced.", "Confession by another perpetrator": "The expert's verdict highlights the confession of Matias Reyes, who was already in prison for a separate rape and murder case. Reyes confessed to raping and beating the Central Park jogger alone, providing specific details that matched the crime scene. This confession further challenges the authenticity of the Central Park Five's supposed admission of guilt."}
