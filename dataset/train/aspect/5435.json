{"The claim of": "180 people so far charged with arson\" was widely reported in the media, including by reputable sources such as The Sun, Breitbart, and The Australian.", "The claim was also shared on social media platforms": "including Facebook, where it gained significant attention and was shared over 600 times.", "However": "the expert's investigation found that the claim is false. The Australian Federal Police (AFP) reviewed all publicly available police statistics and found that far fewer than 180 people have actually been charged with arson specifically related to the current bushfires.", "Different police departments across Australia record bushfire": "related offenses differently, with some states not releasing any figures at all. For example, Victoria did not provide any available statistics, and the Queensland Police Service reported that 109 people have been dealt with for offenses relating to \"recklessly and/or deliberately setting fires,\" which include a range of fire-related offenses beyond arson."}
