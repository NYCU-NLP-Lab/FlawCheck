{"The claim is based on a statement made by President Barack Obama on December 3": "2013, regarding his health care law and its impact on health insurance premiums.", "The claim refers to U": "S. Senator Ron Johnson's assertion that under President Obama's health care reforms, the average premium for a family plan did not decrease by $2,500 per year but instead increased by about $2,500 per year.", "The claim is supported by figures from the Kaiser Family Foundation": "a nonpartisan health policy research group, which show that the average annual premium for an employer-sponsored family plan was $2,581 higher in 2013 compared to when the Affordable Care Act was adopted in 2010.", "Experts note that while premiums did increase after the adoption of the health reform law": "it is difficult to solely attribute these increases to the Affordable Care Act, as other factors such as the recession and economic recovery also influence premium costs. Additionally, the long-term effects of the Affordable Care Act on premiums, especially for employer-sponsored plans, are still uncertain."}
