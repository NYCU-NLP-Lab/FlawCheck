Although initially skeptical, the park staff went to count the penguins and confirmed that one was missing, indicating that the boy's claim may be authentic.", "Verification of the boy": "s condition: Both accounts mentioned that the boy has Down's Syndrome or a mental age equivalent to that of a 12-year-old.
