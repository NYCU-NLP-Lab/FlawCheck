{"Analysis of Spectral Modulations": "The experts employed spectral analysis techniques to examine the data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and identify 234 stars that were producing peculiar signals. These signals were found to have the exact shape of an Extraterrestrial Intelligence (ETI) signal predicted in a previous study by Borra.", "Exclusion of Instrumental Defects": "The experts ruled out the possibility of the detected signals being caused by instrumental defects or other obvious explanations. They carefully examined the data and considered alternative explanations before suggesting that the findings might confirm Borra's theory.", "Correlation with Borra": "s Prediction: The experts observed that Borra had previously proposed a highly speculative theory suggesting that ETI could send light pulses with specific time separations to signal their existence. The detected signals were found to align with this prediction, further supporting the hypothesis that they could be caused by ETI.", "Publication in Scientific Journal": "The experts' findings were published in the November 2016 issue of the scientific journal Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific. The fact that their research underwent peer review and was deemed worthy of publication adds credibility to the authenticity of their claim."}
