{"Confirmation from a witness": "The claim was supported by the testimony of a 21-year-old woman named Cassia Schultz, who described a group called \"Righteous Invasion of Truth\" (RIOT) that she identified as being created by homeschooling families. She mentioned their involvement in Bible study, carrying knives, and learning how to shoot guns.", "Corroboration of homeschooling background": "The claim was further validated by the fact that the suspect, Mark Anthony Conditt, was confirmed to have been homeschooled by his mother. This information aligns with the alleged association with a homeschooling group like RIOT.", "Role": "playing and interest in weapons: Schultz's statement highlighted that the RIOT group engaged in role-playing activities, including using foam weapons and acting out battles. They were also interested in weapons and discussed topics related to science, chemicals, and dangerous mixtures. This aspect adds credibility to the claim.", "Lack of explosives discussion": "Although the claim suggested that RIOT members were interested in weapons and chemicals, Schultz clarified that she did not remember them discussing how to make explosives. This detail provides a nuanced perspective and helps to verify the authenticity of the claim by presenting both similarities and differences between the alleged group and the suspect's actions."}
