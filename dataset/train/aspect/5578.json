{"The source of the claim": "The expert examined the origin of the claim, which was found to be a viral post on social media. The claim was initially made by The Siliguri Mirror page and was shared by other Facebook users as well.", "Verification of the photographs": "The expert analyzed the photographs accompanying the claim and conducted reverse image searches. It was found that the photographs were not representative of the raids on eateries in Kolkata in May 2018. One photograph was found to be from Vietnam in 2012, another from a report on dog meat in Southeast Asia in 2013, and the third from an Iranian news website in 2011.", "Examination of news reports": "The expert searched for news reports related to the raids on eateries in Kolkata in May 2018. While stale meat was recovered from several restaurants, there was no reference to dog meat being found. This information contradicted the claim made in the viral post.", "Lack of credible evidence": "Based on the analysis of the source, photographs, and news reports, the expert concluded that the claim of dog meat being recovered from a hotel in Howrah, Kolkata was baseless. The photographs used to support the claim were found to be old, unrelated, and not from India."}
