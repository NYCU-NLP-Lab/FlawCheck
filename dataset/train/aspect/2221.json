{"Reverse image search": "Alt News conducted a reverse image search on Google to verify the authenticity of the claim. They found that one of the images had been in circulation since April 2018, indicating that it was not representative of the recent protests against CAA.", "Comparison with previous posts": "Alt News found that a Twitter user had posted the same image in 2018, which was retweeted by a Delhi-based Sub Inspector. This further confirmed that the image was not recent and had been circulating for some time.", "Verification of other images": "Alt News also verified the authenticity of the other two images shared in relation to the claim. They found that one image was used in an article by India Today, which attributed it to Press Trust of India. The other image was used by Times of India in their article. This verification added credibility to the images.", "Corroboration with news reports": "Alt News cross-referenced the information from the images with news reports. They found that the images were from the Shah-E-Alam area in Ahmedabad, where violent protests against CAA were reported on December 19. This alignment with news reports further supported the authenticity of the images."}
