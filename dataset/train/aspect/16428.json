{"The United States Code": "The expert refers to Title 4 of the United States Code, which outlines the occasions on which flags should be flown at half-staff. This legal document serves as a reference to verify the authenticity of the claim.", "Presidential Proclamations": "The President of the United States has the authority to issue proclamations directing flags to be flown at half-staff on occasions other than those specified in the United States Code. The expert mentions several examples of such proclamations, including the death of Pope John Paul II and the shootings at various locations.", "State Governors": "Authority: State governors also have the power to direct flags to be flown at half-staff within their jurisdictions. They can do so to mark the death of state officials, members of the armed forces, or other prominent state residents. The expert explains the criteria for flag-lowering set by state governors.", "Comparison of Cases": "The expert compares the deaths of Chris Kyle, Nancy Reagan, and Whitney Houston to highlight the differences in the treatment of their flag-lowering. Chris Kyle, although a highly respected figure, did not meet the criteria for a statewide flag-lowering by the governor. On the other hand, the deaths of Nancy Reagan and Whitney Houston were notable events that warranted flag-lowering based on the United States Code and Presidential Proclamations."}
