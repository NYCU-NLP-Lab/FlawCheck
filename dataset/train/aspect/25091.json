{"The New York City comptroller": "s office study found that 53% of all \"frontline\" workers in the city are immigrants, supporting the claim that immigrants make up a majority of essential workers in places like New York City.", "However": "the comptroller's definition of \"frontline workers\" does not include government workers such as first responders, and it differs from the state's definition of \"essential workers.\" This suggests that other methods of analyzing the data might produce a lower percentage of immigrants among essential workers.", "Gillibrand": "s communication's director stated that the senator was defining essential workers based on the way the New York City comptroller's office defined \"frontline workers\" in their report. This indicates that Gillibrand's claim is based on the specific definition used by the comptroller's office.", "The New York State Department of Economic Development issued guidance on the term": "essential worker,\" which listed several categories of workers that would not be covered under the categories used in the comptroller's report. This suggests that there may be additional categories of essential workers that were not included in the comptroller's study, potentially affecting the overall percentage of immigrants among essential workers."}
