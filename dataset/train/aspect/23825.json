{"Aiken": "s list vs. Ellmers' list: Aiken's office provided a list of 21 votes they counted as evidence for their claim. However, Ellmers' staff provided a list of 24 votes that she gave \"to keep the federal government open.\" This discrepancy in the lists raised questions about the accuracy of Aiken's claim.", "Congressional votes analysis": "The fact-checkers combed through congressional votes during the fall of 2013 to independently verify the claim. They came up with their own list of 26 votes related to funding the Affordable Care Act and the government shutdown. This analysis provided additional information to assess the accuracy of Aiken's claim.", "Understanding the nature of the votes": "It was noted that there was never a direct vote to shut down the government. Instead, it was a series of votes on measures supported by the House but opposed by the Senate and President Obama, which ultimately led to the shutdown. This context was important in evaluating the impact of Ellmers' votes and determining if they aligned with Aiken's claim."}
