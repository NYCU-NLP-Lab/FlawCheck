{"The claim states that the city of Columbus would save": "41 million a year if employees had to contribute to their own pensions. This specific dollar amount is being used as evidence to support the claim.", "The claim mentions that Senate Bill 5": "SB 5) would require government employees to contribute at least 10 percent of their salaries towards their pensions. This aspect of the claim is important in understanding how the savings would be achieved.", "The claim highlights that the new rules under SB 5 would ban": "pension pickups,\" which is a perk in some contracts that calls for the public employer to cover a portion of the pension costs. This aspect suggests that the savings would come from ending the city's practice of paying a portion of the employees' share for pensions.", "The claim references a newspaper survey conducted by The Columbus Dispatch": "which concluded that if SB 5 had been in effect, central Ohio's largest government entities would have saved $74 million in 2010. The survey specifically states that Columbus would have accounted for the biggest chunk of savings, with $41.2 million coming from ending the city's practice of paying much of the employees' share for pensions. This aspect provides additional evidence to support the claim's authenticity."}
