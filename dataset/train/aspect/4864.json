{"The source of the claim": "The expert's verdict highlights that the claim originated from an article published by World News Daily Report on March 25, 2015. This establishes the initial source of the information.", "Testimony of Normand Hodges": "The expert's verdict mentions that Normand Hodges, a retired CIA agent, made a series of confessions while admitted to Sentara General Hospital. Hodges claimed to have committed 37 assassinations for the American government, including Marilyn Monroe.", "Motive and orders": "The article attributed a quote to Hodges, stating that his commanding officer, Jimmy Hayworth, ordered Marilyn Monroe's assassination due to her alleged involvement with President John F. Kennedy and Fidel Castro. The claim suggests that Hodges obeyed orders to eliminate Monroe to prevent the transmission of strategic information to the communists.", "Discrediting evidence": "The expert's verdict points out that the claim was easily disproven by the use of a photograph that was not of Normand Hodges but rather taken from a 2014 article by The Guardian. This discredits the authenticity of the claim and raises doubts about its veracity. Additionally, the expert highlights the disclaimer page of World News Daily Report, stating that it is a satire website known for publishing fictional news articles."}
