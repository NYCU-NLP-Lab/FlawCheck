{"The claim was verified by examining the source of the information": "which was found to be two fake news websites masquerading as legitimate news outlets. These websites were identified by their web addresses, which contained extra letters or slight misspellings.", "The expert also pointed out that there is no actual group called the": "American Amish Brotherhood\" as claimed in the article. The Amish community is divided into Old Order Amish and New Order Amish, but there is no organized group by that name.", "The article referenced a statement supposedly made by AAB chairman Menno Simons": "but there is no evidence of such a person or statement. This lack of verifiable sources raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "The article falsely provided the telephone number for the Pennsylvania Amish Heritage Museum as": "785) 273-0325, which is actually the number for the Westboro Baptist Church. This incorrect information further undermines the credibility of the claim."}
