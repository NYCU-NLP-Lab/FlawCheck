{"Karl Rove": "s statement: Republican consultant Karl Rove claimed that in Texas, Republican nominees \"get 40 percent of the Latino vote on average.\" This statement is the main claim being evaluated for its authenticity.", "National exit polls": "Voter exit polls conducted in 2012 showed that 71 percent of Hispanic voters favored Barack Obama, while only 27 percent supported Mitt Romney. This data suggests that nationally, Republicans did not receive a significant portion of the Latino vote.", "Rick Perry": "s claim: Texas Governor Rick Perry made a similar claim, stating that about 40 percent of his state's Hispanic voters had supported him in the 2010 gubernatorial election. Perry's statement provides some support for the claim that Republicans can attract a significant Latino vote in Texas.", "Polls and surveys": "Austin pollster Mike Baselice conducted a survey in October 2012, which indicated that at that time, Obama had the support of 49 percent of Texas Hispanic voters, while Romney had 40 percent. Another poll by Latino Decisions showed that Republican Senate nominee Ted Cruz had 35 percent of the Hispanic vote in Texas, outpacing Romney's 29 percent. These polls suggest that the claim of Republicans receiving 40 percent of the Latino vote in Texas may be accurate, although the margin of error should be considered."}
