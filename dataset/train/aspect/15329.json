{"The claim made by Pierre Thomas on ABC": "s \"This Week\" was that the number of mass shootings has increased \"three-fold\" in recent years.", "Pete Blair": "director of the Advanced Law Enforcement Rapid Response Training Center at Texas State University, conducted a study on active shooter events from 2000 to 2012 and found that from 2000 to 2008, there were about five events each year, but after 2008 there were nearly 16 each year, matching the tripling described by Thomas.", "However": "Blair's study focused on active shooter events, not specifically mass shootings. In about 20 percent of the cases studied, no one died, and in more than 10 percent of the cases, only one person was killed, which does not meet the definition of a mass shooting.", "Criminologist James Alan Fox from Northeastern University stated that the rate of mass murders has held steady for decades": "with an average of about 20 cases per year and about 100 people killed by mass murderers annually."}
