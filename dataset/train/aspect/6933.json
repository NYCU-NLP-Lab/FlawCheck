{"Historical election data": "The expert analyzed historical election data starting from 1954 to determine the general election turnout in Florida. They found that the claim of the 2012 election being a \"record year of turnout\" was not accurate, as there were 11 instances where the turnout exceeded the 71.2 percent recorded in 2012.", "Comparison to previous elections": "The expert compared the 2012 election turnout to previous elections, specifically highlighting that the highest general election turnout in Florida was 83 percent in 1992. This comparison further supported the conclusion that the claim of a record year of turnout was false.", "Clarification of the claim": "The expert clarified that when the Florida Secretary of State mentioned a \"record year of turnout,\" he was referring to the sheer number of voters (8,491,920) rather than the percentage of voters who participated. This clarification helped to distinguish between the total number of voters and the overall voter turnout percentage.", "Analysis of news sources": "The expert cited a quote from the Miami Herald, which stated that \"Florida in 2012 moved backward when it came to voting.\" This analysis of news sources provided additional evidence to refute the claim of a record year of turnout in the 2012 election."}
