{"The claim made by Judicial Watch that the IRS gave preferential treatment to After School Satan clubs in terms of fast": "tracking their tax-exempt status.", "The lack of evidence provided by Judicial Watch to support their claim": "as the documents they obtained only pertain to Reason Alliance, the organization that sponsors the After School Satan clubs, and not the clubs themselves.", "The statement released by the Satanic Temple": "the group behind the After School Satan program, denying any special treatment from the IRS and clarifying that Reason Alliance had obtained its tax-exempt status before the creation of the clubs.", "The absence of any mention of After School Satan clubs or fast": "tracking in the IRS application and response obtained by Judicial Watch, further undermining the claim."}
