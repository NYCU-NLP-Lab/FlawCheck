{"The publication of the photos on a Facebook post by a page with a large following": "indicating their widespread circulation and potential influence.", "The caption in Hindi accompanying the photos": "which claims that they depict the \"new Kashmir\" after the abolition of Article 370. This suggests a deliberate attempt to link the photos to the recent political development.", "The historical context provided regarding Article 370": "its significance in granting semi-autonomous status to Jammu and Kashmir, and its revocation by the Indian government on August 5, 2019. This information helps to understand the relevance and potential impact of the claim.", "The evidence of the photos": "existence and circulation prior to the abolition of Article 370, as indicated by their appearance in online sources dating back to 2017 and earlier. This undermines the claim that the photos show the current situation in Kashmir and raises doubts about their authenticity."}
