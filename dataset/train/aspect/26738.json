{"Discrepancy in address": "The expert's analysis revealed that the claim of 490 benami companies being registered to the address of Kolkata police headquarters (9/12, Lal Bazar street 1st floor, room no. 9) was false. The actual address of the police headquarters is 18, Lal Bazar. This discrepancy in address casts doubt on the authenticity of the claim.", "Verification from official sources": "The expert cross-checked the address of the police headquarters with the official website of the city police and also contacted Lal Bazar police station. Both sources confirmed that the address mentioned in the claim (9/12 Lal Bazar) actually belongs to the Mercantile Building, which is situated at a distance of 200 meters from the police headquarters. This verification from official sources undermines the credibility of the claim.", "Inconsistencies in company addresses": "The expert examined the list of 490 benami companies provided by Neil Haslam and found that many of them did not have the same address as claimed. Some companies had different floors and blocks, indicating that they were not registered at the address mentioned in the claim. This inconsistency raises doubts about the accuracy of the information presented.", "Lack of supporting evidence": "Despite the claim being viral on social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter, the expert found no concrete evidence or official reports to substantiate the existence of 490 benami companies registered at the address mentioned. The absence of supporting evidence weakens the credibility of the claim."}
