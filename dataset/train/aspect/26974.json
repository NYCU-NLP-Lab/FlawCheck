{"The expert checked Debbie Halvorson": "s official biography to determine when she first entered politics. They found that she served as clerk of Crete Township from 1993 to 1996 and then ran for state Senate and won in 1996, serving until 2008. In 2008, she was elected to her first term in the U.S. House. This verified the claim that Halvorson has been in politics.", "The expert consulted the U": "S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) to obtain employment and unemployment statistics for Illinois. They specifically looked up the non-farm, seasonally adjusted employment figures, which is the most widely used job statistic. The BLS data showed that from 1993 until the present, Illinois gained a net 310,500 jobs, contradicting the claim that the state lost hundreds of thousands of jobs.", "The expert acknowledged that if the job count was started from Halvorson": "s swearing-in as a state senator in 1997, the state had lost 135,000 jobs. Similarly, if the count began from the start of her term in Congress, the state had lost 208,000 jobs. These alternative starting points were considered to provide a different perspective on the claim.", "The expert highlighted the debate over whether the position of Crete Township clerk should be considered": "in politics\" as it was noted that the position had little or no influence on the statewide economy. However, since it was an elected position serving a geographical entity with a significant population, the expert concluded that it counted as being \"in politics.\" This aspect addressed the argument made by a Kinzinger spokesman regarding the relevance of the position to the claim."}
