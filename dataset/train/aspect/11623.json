{"The claim that Sen": "Kamala Harris is not eligible to serve as U.S. President due to her parents' legal residency status for five years prior to her birth was investigated and debunked by Snopes, a reputable fact-checking website.", "The theory resurfaced after an opinion piece published by Newsweek": "in which law professor John C. Eastman argued that Harris may not be eligible to serve as president despite being born in the United States. However, this argument was based on an arcane interpretation of the 14th Amendment's citizenship clause and was refuted by legal experts.", "UCLA law professor Eugene Volokh pointed out that the Supreme Court": "s interpretation in U.S. v. Wong Kim Ark reaffirmed that individuals born in the U.S. are natural-born citizens, regardless of their parents' citizenship. This further discredited the claim against Harris's eligibility.", "The initial claim was made by Jacob Wohl": "a Twitter political troll with a history of failed smear campaigns. His lack of credibility and expertise in constitutional law further undermined the authenticity of the claim."}
