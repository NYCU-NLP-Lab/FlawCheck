{"The statement was made in court on March 3": "2011, by an attorney for the state Department of Administration, Cari Anne Renlund, and it was attributed to Secretary Mike Huebsch. This attribution helps establish the source of the claim.", "The estimate provided by Renlund in court included": "6 million for repairing damaged marble inside the Capitol, $1 million for damage outside, and $500,000 for inspection costs. This breakdown of the estimated costs adds credibility to the claim by providing specific details.", "The damage was attributed to the adhesive of tape used to put up protest signs": "which was said to be acidic and could etch the marble over time. This explanation for the cause of the damage provides a logical explanation for the claim.", "Other testimonies and news reports from the Capitol indicated that there were doubts about the extent of the damage and the accuracy of the claim": "This suggests that there were conflicting accounts and raises questions about the authenticity of the claim."}
