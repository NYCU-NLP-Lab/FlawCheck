{"David Jolly": "s statement: David Jolly explicitly denied ever lobbying for offshore oil drilling during a public forum, stating, \"I have never lobbied for offshore oil drilling, and I'd be interested in what information you might be suggesting because that's never happened.\"", "Association with Free Enterprise Nation": "The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) linked Jolly and his lobbying firm, Three Bridges Advisors, to Free Enterprise Nation, an advocacy group supporting the Roadmap for America's Energy Future, which included offshore drilling. The DCCC cited a Weekly Standard article mentioning the Roadmap's intention to open the Outer Continental Shelf to offshore drilling.", "Lobbyist disclosure": "A lobbyist disclosure revealed that Jolly had worked with Free Enterprise Nation in the past. Although the exact details of his involvement were not mentioned, this association raises questions about his stance on offshore drilling.", "Existing restrictions and recent leasing announcement": "Offshore drilling is currently restricted within certain distances from Florida's coastline. The Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act prohibits drilling within 230 miles of Tampa Bay and 125 miles from the Panhandle. However, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management announced in December that 465,000 acres, including areas near Pensacola, would be leased for drilling in March. This context highlights the relevance and potential impact of Jolly's alleged lobbying activities."}
