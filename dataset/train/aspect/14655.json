{"The meme inaccurately states the date of first United States landfall for three of the four hurricanes mentioned": "2. Depending on the time zone used, the fourth date mentioned in the meme is also inaccurate.", "The meme focuses solely on the damage caused by hurricanes in the United States": "disregarding the devastation they often first cause in the Caribbean.", "The search for numerical patterns in the midst of tragedy is considered spurious": "as hurricanes are complex phenomena that evolve and make landfall at various geographic locations over the course of days and weeks."}
