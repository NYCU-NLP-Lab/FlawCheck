The video showed Rahul Gandhi saying, \"Will install such a machine that if a potato is inserted from one end, gold will come out from the other end.\" This video provided direct evidence of the claim being made.", "The expert": "s verdict also mentioned the Modi government's response to the opposition's criticism of the farm bills. It highlighted the government's release of a full-page advertisement in newspapers accusing the opposition of misleading farmers. This suggests that the claim made by Rahul Gandhi was part of a larger political debate and had implications for the government's policies."}
