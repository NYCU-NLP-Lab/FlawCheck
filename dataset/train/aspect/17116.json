This helps establish the timeline and reach of the claim.", "Translation and description of the post": "The expert highlights that the Burmese-language title of the post translates to English as a warning about the negative effects of \"WY\" or Yaba tablets. The post describes the drug's smell, addictive nature, and potential consequences. This provides insight into the content and intent of the claim.", "Comparison with authoritative sources": "The expert mentions that the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime defines \"yaba\" as methamphetamine tablets, primarily available in East and South-East Asia. This reference to a reputable source helps verify the accuracy of the claim's description.", "Reverse image searches and source analysis": "The expert conducted reverse image searches and found that the photos used in the claim were unrelated to drug abuse. One photo was from a Human Rights Watch report on abuses against people with psychosocial disabilities in Indonesia, another was from a Thai media outlet's report on two brothers with polio, and the third was from a Chinese-language blog unrelated to drugs. This thorough analysis of the photo sources debunks the authenticity of the claim."}
