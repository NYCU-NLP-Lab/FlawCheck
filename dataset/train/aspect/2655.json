{"Lack of credible sources": "The expert's verdict highlights that the claim of finding children's bones on Epstein's island originated from a conspiracy website known for spreading disinformation. The website and its author have a history of constructing fake narratives without credible sources.", "Absence of media coverage": "The expert's verdict mentions that no credible media outlet reported the discovery of children's bones on Epstein's island. This absence of media coverage further supports the notion that the claim is fabricated.", "FBI investigation findings": "The expert's verdict states that a group of FBI investigators raided Epstein's island but found no evidence of human bones, including below the alleged \"satanic temple\" mentioned in the article. This suggests that the claim is not supported by the findings of the official investigation.", "Conspiracy theory proliferation": "The expert's verdict highlights that the claim emerged among a rush of conspiracy theories following Epstein's death. This context suggests that the claim may be part of a larger pattern of unfounded speculation and misinformation surrounding Epstein and his activities."}
