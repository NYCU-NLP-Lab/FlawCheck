{"Wide range of estimates": "The claim states that there are between 9 million and 50 million undocumented immigrants in the United States. This wide range of estimates raises questions about the accuracy and reliability of the claim.", "Lack of specific sources": "The expert's verdict mentions that the Texas Federation of Republican Women, the group behind the claim, did not provide a specific source for the lower estimate of 9 million. This lack of specific sourcing raises concerns about the credibility of the claim.", "Methodology for the higher estimate": "The expert's verdict mentions that the higher estimate of 50 million was provided by a former fellow with Rice University's James A. Baker Institute for Public Policy, Joan Neuhaus Schaan. Schaan's methodology for reaching this estimate is based on assumptions about the percentage of apprehensions of border crossers. This methodology may be subjective and lacks concrete evidence.", "Border Patrol apprehension data": "The expert's verdict also mentions that the Border Patrol reported a decline in apprehensions of border crossers, which may suggest a lower number of undocumented immigrants in recent years. This data contradicts the claim's higher estimate and further questions the accuracy of the claim."}
