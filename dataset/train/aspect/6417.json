{"Lack of evidence": "The expert's verdict states that there is no evidence to suggest that a combination of Motrin and Robitussin causes heart attacks in otherwise healthy children. This lack of evidence undermines the authenticity of the claim.", "Origin of the claim": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim originated from a decade-old email chain that has been circulating since at least 2008. This information raises doubts about the accuracy and reliability of the claim.", "Discrediting the source": "The expert's verdict highlights that the email chain included a signature from \"Lisa Lopez M.A. Children\u2019s Medical Center of Dallas Pulmonary Clinic.\" However, the Children's Medical Center in Dallas came out in 2010 to dispel the rumor and clarify that the information did not come from a reliable source at their institution.

In this case, the expert's opinion suggests that the claim is a rumor and lacks scientific evidence.
