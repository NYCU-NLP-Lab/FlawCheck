{"The expert considered the statements made by Florida leaders": "including Governor Rick Scott, Senate President Don Gaetz, and House Speaker Will Weatherford, regarding raises for state workers. These statements indicated that raises were being discussed and considered, suggesting that state workers may not have had across-the-board raises in recent years.", "The expert mentioned a bill filed by Rep": "Michelle Rehwinkel Vasilinda, which proposed 7 percent raises for all state employees. This bill further supported the claim that state workers had not received raises in six years, as it was introduced as a response to the lack of raises.", "The expert referred to a previous evaluation by PolitiFact Florida": "which rated a similar claim as \"Mostly True.\" This evaluation took into account the last general pay adjustment for state workers, which occurred in 2006, more than six years prior to the evaluation.", "The expert mentioned contacting the Department of Management Services to verify the authenticity of the claim": "The department confirmed that the last across-the-board raise approved for all state employees was in 2006, aligning with the claim made by the reader."}
