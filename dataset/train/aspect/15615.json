{"Democratic state Sen": "Jos\u00e9 Rodr\u00edguez's claim that El Paso had been named America's \"Safest Large City\" was found to be Mostly False. The claim was based on a local press release and the police department had dropped the label of \"safest\" city. Additionally, the other mentioned cities (San Antonio, Houston, and Dallas) did not have the highest overall crime rates, only in comparison to a few huge cities.", "The claim made by El Paso": "s county judge, Veronica Escobar, that El Paso is the safest city of its size in the nation was based on the 2013 CQ Press rankings. These rankings listed El Paso as having the lowest crime-rate ranking among U.S. cities with populations over 500,000. The claim was supported by a press release from the city of El Paso and several news articles that highlighted the CQ Press crime-rate rankings.", "The expert": "s verdict highlighted the use of FBI Uniform Crime Reporting data for 2011, which was released in 2012. This data was used by CQ Press to determine the crime rate rankings of cities. The fact that the claim was based on official crime data adds credibility to the authenticity of the claim."}
