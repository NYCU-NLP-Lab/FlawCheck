{"The claim originated from a single quote published in various entertainment and auto publications in 2008": "where Daniel Craig mentioned his good relationship with Aston Martin and how they allowed him to drive their cars on a track.", "The quote did not explicitly state that Craig received free cars for life": "and the rumor has never been officially confirmed by Aston Martin.", "In August 2013": "it was reported that Craig purchased an Aston Martin V12 Vantage Roadster for $225,000 on his 45th birthday, suggesting that he did not take advantage of any supposed lifetime automotive gratuity.", "Aston Martin": "s CEO, Dr. Andy Palmer, stated in December 2014 that while Craig may not receive a lifetime of free cars, he would continue to drive Aston Martin cars as long as he played James Bond in the movies. This suggests that his access to the fancy automobiles is tied to his role as the iconic spy."}
