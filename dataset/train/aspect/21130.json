{"The claim made by President Donald Trump regarding late": "term abortions and the decision to \"execute the baby\" was found to be a misrepresentation of the actual practice and circumstances of late-term abortions.", "Late": "term abortions are uncommon and typically performed in cases where the pregnancy poses an immediate threat to the life of the mother or when the infant has severe abnormalities that make survival unlikely for more than a few days. In rare cases when the baby is born alive, the parents make the decision whether to request efforts to keep the baby breathing, not to execute the baby.", "Medical researchers and experts emphasize that living infants": "including those born after attempted abortions, receive care and that the notion of executing infants after birth is preposterous.", "Federal and state statutes": "including the Born-Alive Infants Protection Act of 2002, already establish the duty to provide care for children born at any stage of development, including after an abortion. Therefore, the claim that there is a need for a bill to punish doctors who don't try to preserve the life of an infant born alive after an attempted abortion is misleading."}
