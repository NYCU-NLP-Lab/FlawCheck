{"The claim made by the Republican National Committee": "RNC) states that illegal traffic has dropped by at least 90% in four specific Customs and Border Protection (CBP) sectors (El Paso, Yuma, Tucson, and San Diego) where physical barriers have been expanded.", "The RNC": "s claim is based on the assumption that the expansion of physical barriers in these four sectors is solely responsible for the decrease in illegal traffic, without considering other factors that may have contributed to the decline.", "The increase in border fencing was not limited to the four CBP sectors mentioned in the claim": "Both the El Centro sector and the Rio Grande Valley sector also experienced an increase in fencing, but were not included in the RNC's analysis.", "The RNC did not specify the years they were comparing when stating that illegal traffic had dropped by 90": "in the mentioned sectors. Without this information, it is difficult to determine the accuracy of the claim and whether the decrease in apprehensions is solely attributed to the expansion of physical barriers."}
