{"Historical anecdotes": "The expert mentions that there have been anecdotal claims dating back decades earlier regarding the use of coconut water as an intravenous substitute for blood plasma. These anecdotes include stories from World War II where British and Japanese troops allegedly used coconut water for emergency intravenous treatments.", "Medical claims": "The expert refers to a 2002 column in the Sri Lankan Sunday Observer and health-related websites like Body Ecology and Listverse, which make claims about the medical properties of coconut water. These sources state that coconut water is sterile, pyrogen-free, does not produce heat, and does not destroy blood cells, making it a potential substitute for blood plasma.", "Humorous online post": "The expert mentions a humorous online post about \"vegan vampires\" discussing the use of coconut water as an emergency blood transfusion. While not a scientific aspect, it highlights the circulation of the claim in popular culture.", "Expert opinion": "The expert cites the opinion of George Yaghmour, a licensed doctor and assistant professor of clinical medicine at the University of Southern California's Keck School of Medicine. Yaghmour states that coconut water and plasma are not equal fluids and that studies have shown coconut water to mimic intracellular fluids rather than extracellular plasma. He emphasizes that using coconut water as a plasma substitute can have concerning consequences, particularly when given intravenously."}
