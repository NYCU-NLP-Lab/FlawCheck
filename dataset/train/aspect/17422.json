{"Hyatt": "s decision following AForA's conference: Hyatt's policy announcement came shortly after one of their hotels hosted AForA's annual conference. This event, during which AForA's leader, Brigitte Gabriel, claimed to have regular meetings with President Donald Trump, prompted activist groups to campaign against Hyatt hosting AForA. Despite receiving a petition with 100,000 signatures urging them not to host the conference, Hyatt proceeded with the event. This sequence of events reinforces the connection between Hyatt's decision and AForA's activities.", "ACT for America": "s statement: ACT for America (AForA) responded to Hyatt's decision by releasing a statement on October 4, 2018. The statement accused Hyatt of banning all conservative Americans from their hotels and claimed that the decision was a result of a \"Soros-funded smear campaign.\" This statement adds context to the claim and provides insight into AForA's perspective.", "AForA": "s classification as a hate group: The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) has designated AForA as a hate group. The SPLC argues that AForA promotes anti-Muslim conspiracy theories, denigrates American Muslims, and conflates mainstream and radical Islam. This classification further supports the authenticity of Hyatt's decision to ban AForA."}
