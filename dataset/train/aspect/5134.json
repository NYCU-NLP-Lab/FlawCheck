{"The lack of credible sources": "The claim was made by a website called St. Lucian Times, which has no \"about\" page or social media accounts. This lack of credible sources raises suspicions about the authenticity of the claim.", "Inconsistencies in filming location": "The claim stated that Saoirse Ronan died after an on-set accident in St. Lucia while filming the movie Mary Queen of Scots. However, it was found that the film was actually shot in the United Kingdom, not in St. Lucia. This inconsistency further questions the veracity of the claim.", "Fabricated quotes and non": "existent sources: The article included quotes from British film producer Tim Bevan and a coroner named Bradley Cyril. However, it was discovered that there is no known coroner named Bradley Cyril in St. Lucia, and the quotes attributed to Tim Bevan were fabricated. These false sources and quotes cast doubt on the credibility of the claim.", "Contradictory information about other actors": "The claim also mentioned injuries suffered by actress Charlize Theron, who was not even part of the movie Mary Queen of Scots. This contradiction in information about other actors involved in the film adds to the suspicion that the claim is not authentic."}
