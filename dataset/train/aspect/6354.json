{"The amount of money spent by President Barack Obama on the stimulus package was approximately": "816 billion, which is close to a trillion dollars when considering the added debt incurred to support the spending.", "The majority of the stimulus funds were not allocated towards": "make-work government jobs.\" More than two-thirds of the total spending went towards tax benefits and entitlement payments for individuals and businesses to spend as they saw fit.", "A significant portion of the stimulus funds": "worth $261.2 billion, was used to fund work carried out by the private sector, such as road-building companies and hazardous-waste cleanup contractors. This indicates that the claim of \"make-work government jobs\" is dubious.", "The stimulus package was primarily focused on providing contracts": "grants, and loans in areas such as education, transportation, infrastructure, energy, science, and health. Funding for government jobs, such as teachers, was included but was not the sole focus of the stimulus spending."}
