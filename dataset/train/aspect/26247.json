{"Analysis of data from the Center for Responsive Politics": "The expert examined data from the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks campaign contributions from individuals and political action committees. This data was used to determine the amount of money donated to Pete Buttigieg by the health care industry.", "Comparison of contributions in the health sector": "The expert compared the contributions received by Pete Buttigieg and Bernie Sanders in the health sector. While Sanders received more overall donations, Buttigieg came out ahead in contributions from pharmaceutical companies and health services/HMOs.", "Consideration of different definitions of the health care industry": "The expert acknowledged that the definition of the health care industry can vary. OpenSecrets, the source of the data, defined the health sector based on contributions from PACs and individuals working in various health industries. This broad definition was used to analyze the donations.", "Acknowledgment of nuanced factors": "The expert recognized that the analysis of contributions is nuanced. For example, Joe Biden received the most money from the pharmaceuticals and health products sector when contributions from his leadership political action committee were included. This highlights the complexity of determining the exact extent of Buttigieg's support from the health care industry."}
