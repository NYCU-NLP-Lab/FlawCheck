{"Analysis of state": "by-state federal tax burdens and spending: The expert referred to a state-by-state analysis conducted by the Tax Foundation, a business-backed tax policy group based in Washington. This analysis covered a 25-year period from 1981 to 2005 and provided data on the amount of federal taxes paid by Texans and the amount of federal spending received by the state.", "Examination of federal tax data and spending data": "The expert also considered the most recent federal tax data posted by the IRS and federal spending data from the U.S. Census Bureau. By comparing the tax payments collected from Texans and the federal spending received by the state in fiscal years 2008 and 2009, the expert assessed the net gain or loss for Texas.", "Expert opinion from a budget analyst": "The expert consulted Eva DeLuna Castro, a budget analyst at Austin's Center for Public Policy Priorities, who provided insight into the factors contributing to Texas receiving more federal funds in recent years. DeLuna Castro mentioned an increase in military spending, tax cuts and tax credits, modest growth in federal health spending, and a spike in social services funding as reasons for the increase in federal funds received by Texas.", "Comparison of tax payments and federal spending on an annual basis": "The expert noted that there were only six years between 1981 and 2005 when Texas residents paid fewer dollars in federal taxes than they received in return. By considering the annual data, the expert assessed the consistency of Texas receiving more federal spending than it pays in taxes."}
