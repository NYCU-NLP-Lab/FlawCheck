{"The photo shows Cynthia Patag": "a Philippine actress known for her comedic roles, holding a sign that says \"ZERO VOTE\" written across the faces of eight opposition candidates.", "The sign also lists the names of the eight opposition candidates and highlights certain letters from each name in yellow to spell out": "OCHO GAGO,\" which translates to \"EIGHT FOOLS\" in English.", "The statement at the bottom of the poster": "when translated to English, says \"Easy to remember: EIGHT FOOLS,\" which is a play on the name of an opposition alliance called \"Otso Diretso\" (Straight eight).", "A comparison of a photo from Patag": "s official Facebook page on April 29, 2019, shows her in the same pose, against the same background, and wearing the same clothes, but the sign she is holding is in support of candidates from the Otso Diretso alliance."}
