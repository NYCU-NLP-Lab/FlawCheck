{"Increase in arrests and terror": "related offenses: The expert's verdict highlights that there was an increase in the number of arrests relating to \"international terrorism\" and the number of terror-related homicides and attempted murder offenses in the year ending June 2017. This suggests a connection between these offenses and the overall increase in crime.", "Limited contribution to overall crime increase": "The expert points out that the crime figures mentioned in the claim relate specifically to England and Wales, not the entire United Kingdom. Even if there was a maximum possible increase in terrorist-related offenses, it would only have made a very small contribution to the overall increase in crime.", "Lack of specific data on Islamist terror": "related offenses: The expert mentions that the exact number of Islamist terror-related offenses recorded by police in the year ending June 2017 is not provided. This implies that there is insufficient evidence to support the claim's assertion that the rise in crime is linked to \"radical Islamic terror.\"", "Misleading nature of the claim": "The expert criticizes President Donald Trump's claim, stating that it is grossly misleading. The claim attributes the 13 percent rise in crime in the \"U.K.\" to the \"spread of radical Islamic terror,\" but the expert clarifies that the increase in crime only pertains to England and Wales. This highlights the misleading nature of the claim and the need for accurate information."}
