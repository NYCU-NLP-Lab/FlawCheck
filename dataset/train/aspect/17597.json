{"The claim that North Carolina banned sharia law is misleading": "as the First Amendment of the Constitution ensures the free exercise of religion, including Islam.", "North Carolina passed a law in 2013 preventing state judges from using foreign law": "which may include sharia law, to decide cases. However, this law does not ban individual religious practice.", "The legislation targeting": "Sharia law\" has been deemed \"totally useless\" by a senior research analyst at the Southern Poverty Law Center, as the US Constitution already denies authority to foreign law.", "Twelve other US states have passed similar laws": "and 43 states have proposed or passed bills of this kind, according to an Islamophobia report by the Council on American-Islamic Relations."}
