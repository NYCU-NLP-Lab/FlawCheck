{"The size discrepancy": "The expert points out that the photograph shows a spider that is claimed to be a \"Giant Hawaiian Cane Spider\" with a potential size of up to six feet across. However, the expert explains that even the largest known spider species have a legspan of no more than about 12 inches, much smaller than the one depicted in the image.", "Inaccurate descriptions": "The expert highlights that the same image has been circulated multiple times with different descriptions, such as a Giant Hawaiian Cane Spider, an Angolan Witch spider, and a Columbian Diablo spider. This inconsistency raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Realistic size of cane spiders": "The expert states that while cane spiders do exist in Hawaii and other parts of the U.S., they are only about an inch long with a leg span of up to 5 inches. This information contradicts the exaggerated size of the spider shown in the photograph.", "Original image source": "The expert mentions that the artist responsible for creating the image, Paul Santa Maria, provided a copy of the original photograph he used, which features a wolf spider. This suggests that the image of the giant spider was digitally manipulated and not an authentic representation."}
