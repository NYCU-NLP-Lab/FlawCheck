{"Nidhi Razdan": "s announcement and subsequent confirmation from Harvard University: Nidhi Razdan publicly announced in June 2020 that she was leaving her job as a television news anchor to join Harvard University as a journalism professor. Harvard later confirmed that there was no evidence of the university hiring her, verifying the claim that the job offer was a hoax.", "Harvard University": "s programs and journalism degrees: It was verified that Harvard University's graduate and undergraduate programs do not offer journalism degrees. However, it was noted that their school of continuing education, which is a separate program, does offer journalism courses. This information adds credibility to the claim that Razdan's claim of being offered a professorship in journalism at Harvard was not legitimate.", "Lack of additional evidence": "Apart from Razdan's own posts detailing the incident, no further evidence of the phishing attack was provided. This aspect highlights the need for additional supporting evidence to fully verify the authenticity of the claim.", "Filing a complaint with Delhi Police": "Razdan filed a complaint with the cybercrime cell of the Delhi Police, mentioning offenses such as forgery, cheating, identity fraud, and impersonation. The fact that a formal complaint was filed adds weight to the claim and indicates that legal action is being pursued in response to the alleged hoax."}
