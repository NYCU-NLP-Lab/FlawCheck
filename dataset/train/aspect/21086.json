{"Multiple instances of Trump expressing his desire for falling real estate prices": "The expert's verdict mentions that there are many examples from 2006 to 2009 where Donald Trump spoke about the \"great opportunity\" that came with falling real estate prices. This includes instances from a Trump audiobook from 2006, where he explicitly states that he hopes for a real estate bubble burst so that he can buy properties and make money.", "Confirmation from a Trump interview": "The expert's verdict mentions a specific interview with Trump on CNN in 2009, where he again talks about the economic situation being a \"great opportunity\" for buying real estate. This interview serves as additional evidence to support the claim made by Hillary Clinton.", "Context of the housing crisis": "The expert's verdict highlights that the housing crisis was already underway during the time Trump made these statements. This context strengthens the claim that Trump's desire for falling real estate prices was tied to the ongoing crisis.", "Verification from the Trump campaign": "The expert's verdict mentions that they reached out to the Trump campaign for their response or clarification on the claim. While the specific response from the campaign is not mentioned, the fact that they sought verification from the campaign adds credibility to the claim."}
