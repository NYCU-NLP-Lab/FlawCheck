{"The online advertisement featured an outdated claim about Costco closing stores in 2020": "indicating that it had been displayed prior to the new year and was not current.", "The slideshow article on the Housecoast website": "which the ad led readers to, was poorly written and contained grammatical errors. It also did not mention Costco closing its stores.", "Costco": "s e-commerce business experienced a 50% increase in sales, particularly in areas like same-day and 2-day grocery deliveries, prescription medications, electronics, and office supplies. This indicates that the company was actively meeting members' needs and expanding its online presence, contradicting the claim of store closures."}
