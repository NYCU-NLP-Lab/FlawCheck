{"Social media sharing": "The expert noted that the claim originated from social media users who shared the graphic image and caption in February 2016. This aspect suggests that the claim gained traction through online platforms.", "Previous circulation of similar stories": "The expert mentioned that versions of the \"fetuses found in a Chinese restaurant freezer\" story had been circulating for several months. This aspect indicates that the claim was not a new phenomenon and had similarities to previous stories about soup made from fetuses or babies in China.", "Miscaptioning and misinterpretation": "The expert highlighted that the photograph in question was linked to a separate instance of miscaptioning. The image was initially associated with claims of fetuses discovered in a dumpster outside an abortion clinic in Michigan, but it actually dated back several years and was related to a discovery in Nepal. This aspect reveals that the image was wrongly attributed to the Chinese restaurant context.", "Connection to a different incident": "The expert mentioned that the image was likely one of several taken following the discovery of 2,000 fetuses in a temple in Thailand in 2010. The fetuses were hidden at the temple by illegal abortion clinics. This aspect suggests that the image was unrelated to Chinese food or meat markets, further questioning the authenticity of the claim."}
