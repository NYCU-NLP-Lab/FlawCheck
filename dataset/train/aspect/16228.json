{"The expert used a recording service that chronicles and time": "stamps live television programming to verify the timing of Patricia Smith's speech at the Republican National Convention and Khizr Khan's speech at the Democratic National Convention.", "The expert found that Patricia Smith": "s speech was aired live by CNN and MSNBC, but not on Fox News. Fox News went to commercial right before Smith took the stage and returned to a phone interview between Donald Trump and Bill O'Reilly.", "The expert also found that Khizr Khan": "s speech was aired live by CNN and MSNBC, but not on Fox News. Fox News was in a commercial when Khan began speaking and showed pictures of Khan speaking on the side without audio.", "The expert compared the coverage of both speeches and concluded that they were covered the same way by CNN": "MSNBC, and C-SPAN. Therefore, Brian Kilmeade's statement that \"nobody\" aired Patricia Smith's remarks live, but \"almost everybody\" covered Khan's remarks live was rated as false."}
