{"The misleading online advertisement on the Outbrain advertising network falsely claimed that U": "S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was married in early February 2021.", "The article on the Hollywood Tale website": "which the ad led readers to, did not mention anything about Ocasio-Cortez being married or having a husband.", "Near the end of the article": "there was an incomplete and poorly written page that described Ocasio-Cortez's boyfriend, Riley Roberts, indicating that she was not married at the time.", "The 2018 Vogue profile of Ocasio": "Cortez confirmed that she was living with her boyfriend, Riley Roberts, in a one-bedroom apartment, further supporting the fact that she was not married in early February 2021."}
