{"The claim is based on mischaracterizing an old image": "The expert's verdict states that the claim is using an old image to falsely suggest that the Republican incumbents are victims of voter fraud. The image in question is from a Dec. 3 committee hearing that focused on unfounded allegations of election fraud.", "The image does not show the two sitting senators counting ballots": "The expert's verdict clarifies that the image of the poll workers is from footage taken by the Associated Press in Pittsburgh on Nov. 7, and it does not show \"CCTV footage of the election count in Georgia\" as claimed in the Facebook post.", "Democrats Elena Parent and Jen Jordan are not pictured in the Pennsylvania footage": "The expert's verdict mentions that both Parent and a spokesperson for Jordan confirmed that they are not pictured in the footage from Pennsylvania. This contradicts the claim made in the Facebook post.", "Reliable sources confirm the election results": "The expert's verdict includes references to reputable sources such as The New York Times, Georgia Public Radio, and YouTube, which provide information about the actual election results in Georgia. These sources support the authenticity of the claim that Rev. Raphael Warnock beat Sen. Kelly Loeffler and Jon Ossoff was leading in the race against Sen. David Perdue."}
