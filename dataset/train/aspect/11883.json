{"Rep": "Jason Chaffetz projected a chart during a congressional hearing that compared the number of prevention services and cancer screenings performed by Planned Parenthood in 2006 and the number of abortions performed in 2013.", "The chart featured two lines crossing": "one representing the upward trend in abortions and the other representing the downward trend in cancer screenings and prevention services.", "Chaffetz used the chart to highlight the increase in abortions and reduction in breast exams": "stating that it reflected the changes happening within Planned Parenthood.", "The chart used a dual": "axis format, with cancer screenings and prevention services plotted in the millions on the left side and abortions plotted in the hundreds of thousands on the right side. This format is typically used to compare different measures, but in this case, it compared equivalent measures using different scales, which experts found inappropriate and misleading."}
