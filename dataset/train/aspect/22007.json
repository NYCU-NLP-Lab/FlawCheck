{"The tax bill passed by President Trump does not stack up as the largest tax cut ever": "as stated by the Joint Committee on Taxation, Congress's nonpartisan arbiter of tax analysis.", "The Treasury Department has published a list of the biggest tax bills in history": "and the recent tax bill ranks as the fourth-biggest since 1940 when measured using inflation-adjusted dollars.", "When ordered from highest to lowest as a percentage of GDP": "the recent tax bill ranks seventh among the largest tax cuts.", "The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget noted that an earlier tax cut from 1921": "not included in the Treasury Department analysis, accounted for 1.1 percent of GDP, suggesting that surpassing the record set in 1981 would require a tax cut costing roughly $6.8 trillion over ten years."}
