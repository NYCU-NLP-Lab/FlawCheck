{"Media reports": "The expert examined media reports from the events and found that they did not mention any buses or transportation of protesters. The reports only mentioned local teachers and supporters protesting at the designated locations.", "Eye": "witness account: The expert received an email from a journalist who was present at one of the protest sites. The journalist stated that there were no buses around and they did not perceive anyone had been bused in. They recognized many of the teachers, indicating that the protesters were local and not transported from outside.", "Lack of evidence": "The expert noted that there was no concrete evidence provided by the Florida Chamber of Commerce or any other sources to support the claim of union bosses busing in protesters. The chamber spokesperson mentioned reports about event-planning but did not provide specific details.", "Union affiliations": "The expert mentioned that the protests were organized through large union e-mail lists that included affiliations with groups like MoveOn.org and former members of ACORN. While this suggests some level of organization, it does not necessarily prove the claim of busing in protesters."}
