{"Testimony of the journalist": "The expert's verdict mentions that a journalist, Santosh Kumar, claimed to have witnessed a scuffle near the Constitution Club and stated that Umar Khalid was not present at the spot when the incident took place. This testimony is one aspect used to verify the authenticity of the claim.", "Video evidence": "The expert's verdict refers to a video posted by journalist Vikas Bhadauria, which shows Santosh Kumar making the claim about Umar Khalid's absence during the incident. The video serves as another aspect employed to verify the claim.", "Social media reaction": "The expert's verdict mentions the quick reaction on social media to the incident, with the video of Santosh Kumar's testimony being widely circulated. The fact that the video gained significant attention and was shared by prominent right-wing social media users is another aspect used to assess the authenticity of the claim.", "Lack of evidence supporting the attack": "The expert's verdict states that Santosh Kumar claimed there was no attack on Umar Khalid and that it was just a scuffle between two other people with an air fire. The absence of evidence supporting an attack on Khalid and the assertion that the incident was staged for sympathy and to target the Prime Minister is another aspect considered in verifying the claim."}
