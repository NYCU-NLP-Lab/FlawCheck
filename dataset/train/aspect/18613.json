{"The claim made by U": "S. Sen. Ron Johnson is that prior to Obamacare, 95 percent of Wisconsinites were covered by insurance, and after Obamacare, 95 percent of Wisconsinites were still covered by insurance, implying that Obamacare had no impact on the number of uninsured individuals in Wisconsin.", "The supporting evidence provided by Johnson": "s team confirms that the numbers he mentioned were incorrect. The correct figures are that 94 percent of Wisconsinites were insured before Obamacare, and 95 percent were insured after.", "The data used to support Johnson": "s claim comes from the 2010 and 2014 Wisconsin Family Health Survey, conducted by the Wisconsin Department of Health Services. However, using the 2010 survey is problematic due to changes in methodology, and the 2012 survey showed the same 94 percent insured rate as 2010.", "More recent data from the U": "S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey contradicts Johnson's claim. It shows a significant drop in the number of uninsured Wisconsinites since Obamacare took effect, with the uninsured rate decreasing from 9.4 percent in 2013 to 5.7 percent in 2015, a drop of nearly 40 percent."}
