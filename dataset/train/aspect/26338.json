{"The claim involves a collage of seven photos featuring Bavarian Minister": "President Markus S\u00f6der receiving vaccinations, purporting to show evidence of \"fake jabs\" during Covid-19 vaccination campaigns.", "The photos actually show S\u00f6der receiving different vaccinations at separate events between 2009 and 2020": "as confirmed by the expert's investigation.", "The post was shared on Facebook on February 23": "2021, and has been shared more than 200 times, indicating its potential reach and impact.", "Reverse image searches on Google revealed that five out of the seven pictures show S\u00f6der receiving a flu vaccination": "one is from a vaccination against swine flu, and another one is from a vaccination against ticks. This further supports the authenticity of the claim's debunking."}
