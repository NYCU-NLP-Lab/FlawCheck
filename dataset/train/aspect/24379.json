{"Lack of specific job data for the city of Buffalo": "The expert mentions that neither the state nor the U.S. Department of Labor tracks the number of jobs specifically for the city of Buffalo. Instead, they provide job data for the Buffalo-Niagara Falls metropolitan area.", "Availability of job data only from 1990 onwards": "The expert points out that job data before 1990 cannot be accurately compared with the figures from the past 25 years due to changes in the way job data is compiled. Therefore, the comparison of current job numbers with historical data is limited.", "Increase in private sector jobs in Buffalo": "The expert mentions that the federal and state labor departments reported 479,500 private sector jobs in August in the Buffalo Niagara region, which is higher than the 439,000 jobs reported in 1990. This indicates an increase in private sector jobs over the years.", "Cuomo": "s claim supported by data: The expert states that the data from the federal and state labor departments back up Cuomo's claim that there are currently more private sector jobs in Buffalo than at any other time dating back to at least 1990. This suggests that Cuomo's assertion is supported by available job data."}
