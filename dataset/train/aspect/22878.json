{"The photo was taken by Getty Images photographer Mark Mainz in December 2003 in New York City": "The caption clearly states that the person in the photo is Ghislaine Maxwell with an unidentified male companion attending the opening of the Asprey Flagship store on 5th Avenue. This provides evidence that the claim of the photo showing Wayfair president of operations Bill Hutcherson with Ghislaine Maxwell is false.", "Wayfair does not have a president of operations listed on its website": "The company's executive leadership team does not include anyone named \"Bill Hutcherson,\" further discrediting the claim.", "The post was flagged by Facebook as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation": "This indicates that the claim is likely to be false and lacks credibility.", "Tatler magazine identifies the man in the photo as George Bamford": "the founder of Bamford Watch Department. This contradicts the claim that the man in the photo is Bill Hutcherson, further undermining the authenticity of the claim."}
