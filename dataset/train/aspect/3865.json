{"The claim is supported by a fundraising letter written by Cathie Adams": "the chair of the Republican Party of Texas, which accuses Bill White of offering sanctuary to illegal immigrants.", "The Republican Party points to a report from the Congressional Research Service in 2006 that lists Houston as one of the 32 localities with sanctuary policies": "However, Houston's officialdom, including Bill White and the Police Chief, dispute this characterization and note that there is no city ordinance designating Houston as a sanctuary city.", "A 2007 U": "S. Department of Justice report, brought to attention by Bill White's campaign, states that only two jurisdictions receiving at least $1 million a year in federal aid to incarcerate \"criminal aliens\" had official sanctuary policies posted online, namely San Francisco and the state of Oregon. Harris County, where Houston is located, was receiving more than $2 million in annual aid at the time, suggesting it may have been included in the DOJ review.", "Despite the lack of an official sanctuary policy": "the report from the Congressional Research Service explains that sanctuary cities often adopt a \"don't ask-don't tell\" policy where employees, including law enforcement officers, are not required to report unauthorized immigrants to federal officials. Houston's officialdom denies implementing such a policy."}
