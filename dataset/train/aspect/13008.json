{"Lack of evidence": "The expert states that there is no evidence to support the claim that Hillary Clinton was to be indicted in the Whitewater scandal or had any connection to the Oklahoma City bombing. This lack of evidence undermines the authenticity of the claim.", "Government denials": "Government officials denied that any documents associated with the Whitewater case were in the Murrah building. This denial, as reported by the Washington Post, contradicts the claim that all documents were lost in the bombing.", "Competing conspiracy theories": "The expert mentions that there were multiple conspiracy theories surrounding the Oklahoma City bombing, including one that implicated President Clinton. This indicates that the claim about Hillary Clinton's involvement is just one among many unsubstantiated theories.", "Historical context": "The expert provides historical context by mentioning the investigation of the Clintons in the 1990s. This suggests that the claim may be part of a pattern of scandalous theories attributed to the Clinton family, further casting doubt on its authenticity."}
