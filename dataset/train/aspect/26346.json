{"U": "S. Sen. Ron Johnson's voting record: The expert mentions that Johnson voted for a Senate bill amendment in 2012 that would have eliminated the authority of the Agriculture Department to increase federal grants for broadband access in rural areas. In 2013, Johnson also voted against a Senate bill amendment that aimed to expand high-speed broadband service to rural areas. These voting records suggest a stance against faster broadband internet in small towns.", "Opposition to rural broadband as a public utility": "The expert notes that Johnson opposes the idea of rural broadband being treated as a public utility, which is supported by his opponent, former U.S. Sen. Russ Feingold. This opposition further indicates a reluctance to support faster broadband internet in rural areas.", "Campaign contributions from telecom special interests": "The claim states that Johnson received nearly $90,000 in campaign contributions from telecom special interests. The expert's verdict mentions this fact, highlighting the potential influence of these contributions on Johnson's stance on faster broadband internet in small towns.", "Letter to the FCC chairman": "The expert mentions that Johnson and five other Republican senators wrote a letter to the FCC chairman arguing that the definition of broadband was \"too fast\" and expressing concerns about increased regulation and disincentivizing telecommunications companies to offer higher speeds. This letter suggests a lack of support for faster broadband internet in rural areas."}
