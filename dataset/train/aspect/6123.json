{"The origin of the claim": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim originated from a tweet by Jitu Patwari, who is the in-charge of Gujarat Congress and working president of Madhya Pradesh Congress. This establishes the initial source of the claim.", "Multiple social media posts": "The expert's verdict highlights that the picture of the airplane was widely circulated on Twitter and Facebook by various individuals and political leaders, including Rakesh Sachan, Imran Pratapgrahi, Pankaj Punia, and the UP East Youth Congress. This indicates that the claim gained traction and attention on social media platforms.", "Reference to previous controversy": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim was made in response to Union Minister Hardeep Singh Puri's swipe at Congress MP Rahul Gandhi over images showing him sitting on cushioned seats on a tractor. This suggests that the claim was made as a counterpoint to criticize the government and draw attention to perceived discrepancies.", "Verification through image search": "The expert's verdict states that a reverse image search was conducted, which revealed that the luxurious airplane in the picture is Mexico's Boeing 787 Dreamliner, and not PM Modi's private aircraft.
