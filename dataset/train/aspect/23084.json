{"Incorrect dates": "The expert's verdict highlights that the dates listed for the outbreaks of most of the diseases mentioned in the claim are incorrect.

This undermines the argument that outbreaks occur specifically in election years.", "Verification through official sources": "To verify the authenticity of the claim, the expert consulted reputable sources such as the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. These sources provided accurate information about the timing and spread of the diseases mentioned.", "Inaccurate portrayal of disease severity": "The claim suggests that COVID-19 is being \"hyped\" to hurt President Donald Trump by comparing it to previous outbreaks.
