{"Lack of verifiable information": "The expert points out that there is a lack of information about where and when the photograph was taken. No sources have been provided for the photograph, making it difficult to verify its authenticity.", "Inclusion of emotionally manipulative claims": "The claim includes a specific detail about one of the wolves being a mother and leaving behind orphaned cubs. The expert highlights that this detail was not present in the earliest versions of the rumor and questions its veracity.", "Absence of reliable sources": "The expert mentions that the earliest postings of the rumor contained little more than insults, baseless claims, and a request for followers to \"Name and Shame\" the alleged hunter at her place of business. This lack of credible sources raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Suspicious timing": "The expert notes that the rumor surfaced when the story of Cecil the Lion's death was moving out of the national spotlight and Walter Palmer was returning to his dental practice. The timing of the rumor raises suspicions about its intention and credibility."}
