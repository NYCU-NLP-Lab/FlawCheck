{"The claim is made in a video produced by the USF Divest coalition": "which calls on USF administrators to stop investing in industries such as private prison operators, tobacco companies, oil companies, and weapons manufacturers. The video features a student narrator who highlights the issue and urges the university president to implement an ethical review process for investment decisions.", "The claim is supported by statements from individuals in the video who claim that the University of South Florida invests in oil companies like BP": "despite the negative impact on the environment caused by oil spills. They also assert that the university invests in tobacco companies, which contradicts USF's status as a tobacco-free campus. Additionally, the claim states that the university invests in weapons manufacturers.", "The evidence for the claim is said to come from a 2013 document detailing how the USF Foundation": "which manages the university's endowment, invests its share of the funds. The USF Divest coalition claims that this document supports their assertion that the university invests in the mentioned industries.", "The difficulty in verifying the claim lies in the fact that the USF Foundation": "as a nonprofit organization, is shielded from full disclosure of its investment records under Florida laws. This makes it challenging to pinpoint the exact companies in which the foundation invests its money. However, it is known that the foundation's Investment Committee oversees the university's total endowment of over $400 million and hires investment managers who make decisions on specific investments."}
