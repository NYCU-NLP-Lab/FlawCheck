The bill introduced the term \"forcible rape,\" which was not defined in the legislation. This clause drew criticism from women's organizations, who accused the bill's sponsors of trying to redefine rape.", "Removal of the term": "forcible\": Due to the controversy surrounding the term \"forcible rape,\" Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee dropped the word \"forcible\" from the bill.
