{"The number of teachers fell by about 4": "500 over the course of two years after Chris Christie took office in 2010, which contradicts the claim that 6,000 teachers were fired.", "The term": "firing\" is deemed incorrect by the director of communications for the New Jersey Education Association, as the reduction in teacher numbers resulted from a mix of layoffs and retirements due to budget cuts.", "The exact breakdown of how many teachers were laid off versus retired is unknown": "making it difficult to attribute the entire loss of teachers solely to Christie's policies.", "Other factors": "such as a multi-billion dollar state budget deficit and the expiration of stimulus aid, also contributed to the contentious year for school funding in 2010, suggesting that Christie's policies were not the sole cause of teacher reductions."}
