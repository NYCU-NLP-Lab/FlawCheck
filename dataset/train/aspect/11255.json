{"The claim is supported by a statement made by ABC News security consultant Richard Clarke": "who discussed the drone strike that killed two western hostages on ABC \"This Week\" on April 26, 2015.", "The concept of signature strikes": "which are drone strikes targeting individuals believed to be militants without knowing their exact identity, is explained and criticized by government officials and experts.", "Richard Clarke": "a former government official with extensive experience in national security, asserts that the continued use of signature strikes contradicts what President Barack Obama had previously stated he would do.", "Despite efforts to verify the claim": "including searching through Obama's statements and campaign materials, no direct instance was found where Obama explicitly stated he would stop using signature strikes. The lack of concrete details and limited public availability of relevant documents further contribute to the difficulty in determining the authenticity of the claim."}
