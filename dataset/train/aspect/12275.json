{"The claim is based on a statement made by Virginia Rep": "Randy Forbes, who accuses his GOP primary opponent, Scott Taylor, of violating federal election law 19 times.", "The expert": "s investigation reveals that the claim is an overreach by opposition researchers. The Federal Election Commission (FEC) has only cited Taylor's 2010 campaign committee for one violation, which resulted in a fine of $0.", "The other 18": "violations\" mentioned in the claim were actually automatic \"request for additional information\" notices sent by the FEC staff to the defunct Taylor campaign committee. These notices were seeking additional reports and suggesting that the campaign \"may\" be violating reporting requirements. However, the FEC decided in 2015 not to pursue any further enforcement action.", "The Forbes campaign has repeatedly used the claim of 19": "violations\" to attack Taylor, both on a dedicated website and in a TV advertisement. However, the additional 18 \"violations\" are not substantiated and are a result of misinterpreting the FEC's notices."}
