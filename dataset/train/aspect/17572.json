This is presented as a comparison to White's stance.", "Differences between civil unions and marriage": "The expert includes a quote from Yolanda Padilla, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin, highlighting that civil unions do not provide the same protections as marriage in terms of legal and financial rights, benefits, and protections.
