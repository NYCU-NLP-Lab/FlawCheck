{"The video evidence in the claim was analyzed and compared to images and videos of the Church of San Bernardino alle Ossa in Milan": "Italy. It was found that the video matched the images and videos of this church, indicating that the claim about the location of the skeletal remains in the Vatican was false.", "A commenter disputed the claim and shared a link to a Wikipedia article that provided information about the ossuary in Milan": "The article stated that the ossuary was built in the 1200s to store remains when the nearby cemetery filled up. This information further supported the conclusion that the video was taken in Milan, not in the Vatican.", "The expert": "s verdict also highlighted that in Vatican City, two underground ossuaries were unearthed in 2019 during a search for a missing girl. The forensic team concluded that the bones found in these ossuaries dated back to a period no later than the end of the 19th century. This information further supports the fact that the claim of finding skulls and bones in the Vatican is not accurate."}
