{"The presence of BJP workers posing as": "locals' at Singhu border and protesting against the farmers' movement, as reported by Alt News, raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim. This suggests a potential political motive behind the claim.", "The video showing a police officer wearing a mask and expressing his dissatisfaction with the job": "which carries the logo of 'TheFollowUp', is found to be clipped from a September 18, 2020 bulletin by Alt News. This indicates that the video is not recent and may not be directly related to the claim.", "A keyword search on Google by Alt News reveals an ANI report from the same date as the video": "stating that state police clashed with assistant police personnel in Ranchi. The clash was due to the demand for regularisation of their jobs, not directly related to the farmers' agitation in Delhi. This suggests that the video may have been misused to support the claim.", "Another video showing a police officer addressing a constable in riot gear and making remarks about the need to control the situation is shared with the claim": "However, there is no direct evidence linking this video to the claim, and it does not provide substantial proof of the mass resignation of 200 Delhi police officers."}
