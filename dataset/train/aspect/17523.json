{"The source of the claim": "The expert's verdict highlights that the claim originated from Erin Elizabeth's medical conspiracy blog \"Health Nut News\" and was based on Facebook posts by John Kuhles, who runs anti-5G conspiracy websites and social media pages.", "Lack of evidence": "The expert points out that John Kuhles made the claim without providing any evidence to support the connection between the 5G test and the bird deaths. The lack of evidence undermines the authenticity of the claim.", "Alternative explanation": "The expert mentions that the municipal government of The Hague confirmed the occurrence of bird deaths in Huijgenspark but attributed them to unknown causes. This alternative explanation suggests that the claim about the 5G test being the cause of the bird deaths may not be accurate.", "Precautionary measures": "The expert notes that the bird deaths in Huijgenspark led to the implementation of a dog ban as a precautionary measure. This highlights that the local authorities took action based on the occurrence of the bird deaths, but it does not necessarily confirm the claim about the 5G test being the cause."}
