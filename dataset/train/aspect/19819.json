{"Trump": "s tweet: The expert's verdict mentions that U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted on May 31, 2020, stating that the United States would be designating \"ANTIFA\" as a \"Terrorist Organization.\" This tweet serves as a claim made by the President himself.", "Statements by top officials": "The expert's verdict highlights that U.S. Attorney General William Barr, along with other top officials, have blamed antifa and similar groups for the protests without providing evidence. Barr also stated that the violence instigated by antifa during the riots is domestic terrorism. This aspect involves the statements made by high-ranking officials in support of the claim.", "Lack of legal process": "The expert's verdict mentions that the United States currently does not have a process for designating domestic groups as terrorist organizations. This aspect highlights the legal constraints that make it highly unlikely for Trump to enforce such a designation.", "Nature of antifa": "The expert's verdict provides information about antifa as an amorphous movement opposed to fascism. It emphasizes that antifa does not comprise an organized group, lacks visible leadership, and acknowledges its secrecy. Additionally, it mentions that antifa groups have various positions and employ a range of tactics. This aspect focuses on the nature and characteristics of antifa as a movement, which may challenge the claim's authenticity."}
