{"The claim was backed up by a report from the Legislative Budget Board": "which compared spending in the 2012-13 budget with the previous budget cycle and showed a reduction of $15.2 billion.", "The": "15 billion reduction was the largest in the past half-century, according to the spokesman for the budget board's staff.
