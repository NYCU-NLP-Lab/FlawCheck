They highlighted that the current rate of borrowing a million dollars a minute is significantly lower than the rate in 2009 when the government borrowed over $2.6 million per minute.", "Comparison to national income": "To further evaluate the claim, the expert compared the borrowing rate to the income generated by the U.S. economy.
