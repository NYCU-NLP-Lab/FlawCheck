{"U": "S. President Donald Trump's claim: The claim in question is that when Trump took office, the U.S. military didn't have any ammunition. This claim was made by Trump during a news conference and was captured on video.", "Verification through video evidence": "The expert's verdict includes a link to a video posted on Twitter by Vox reporter Aaron Rupar. The video shows Trump making the claim during a news conference where he was discussing his decision to pull U.S. troops out of northern Syria. This video serves as evidence of Trump's statement.", "Contradictory statements by Trump": "The expert's verdict mentions that this was not the only time Trump made such a claim. In September 2019, he also stated that former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis told him the military was low on ammunition. This additional statement by Trump adds to the evidence that he has made similar claims in the past.", "Historical origin of the claim": "The expert's verdict mentions that the idea that U.S. troops had no ammunition originated before Trump took office. It refers to a 2014 article from a now-defunct junk news website called U.S. Report. This historical context provides further insight into the claim's authenticity and its existence prior to Trump's presidency."}
