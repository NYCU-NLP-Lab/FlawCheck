{"Lack of credible reports": "The expert mentions that no credible reports were found in their keyword search that suggested voting rights were being taken away from Muslims in Denmark. This indicates that there is no evidence to support the claim.", "Danish Parliament": "s website: The expert refers to the Danish Parliament's website, which states that Danish citizens with permanent residence in Denmark, Greenland, or the Faroe Islands, who are at least 18 years old, are entitled to vote. There is no mention of voting rights being granted or denied based on religion. This information contradicts the claim.", "Enactment of a law to end citizenship": "The expert mentions that in October 2019, Denmark enacted a law to end the citizenship of Danes who went abroad to work with militant groups like the Islamic State. This information suggests that Denmark is taking measures related to national security, but it does not support the claim of abolishing the Muslim right to vote.", "Improbability and lack of international attention": "The expert points out that the total population of Denmark in 2017 was 5.8 million, with Muslims forming 5.3% of the population. Considering the increase in the Muslim population over the years, it is highly unlikely that the voting rights of such a large section of people would be taken away without gaining international attention. This further discredits the claim."}
