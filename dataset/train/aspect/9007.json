{"Analysis of Wage Data": "The expert likely examined wage data from the past four years to determine if there has been any significant change or stagnation in average wages. This analysis would involve comparing wage levels over time and assessing any trends or fluctuations.", "Comparison with Inflation": "To verify the claim, the expert may have compared average wages to the rate of inflation over the past four years. If wages have barely budged, they would not have kept up with inflation, resulting in a decrease in real wages. This comparison would provide additional evidence of the claim's authenticity.", "Examination of Economic Indicators": "The expert might have looked at various economic indicators, such as GDP growth, employment rates, and productivity levels, to assess the overall economic conditions during the specified period. If these indicators show limited growth or stagnation, it would support the claim that average wages have barely budged.", "Review of Expert Opinions": "The expert may have consulted other economists or researchers in the field to gather their perspectives on the claim. By considering the opinions and analyses of other experts, the authenticity of the claim could be verified or challenged. This step would add credibility to the overall assessment of the claim."}
