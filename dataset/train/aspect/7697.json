{"The expert analyzed the claim made by incumbent Mark Sharpe that he cut property taxes by 17 percent": "This claim was found to be Barely True by the expert.", "The expert also examined the counterclaim made by challenger Josh Burgin": "stating that property taxes are actually 18 percent higher than when Sharpe first took office.", "To verify Burgin": "s claim, the expert obtained the property tax revenue figures for each year Sharpe has been in office since 2004 from Hillsborough County budget documents. The numbers provided by Burgin were confirmed to be accurate.", "However": "the expert discovered a significant issue with Burgin's calculation. The fiscal year used as the base year for comparison was incorrect. The proper base year would be fiscal year 2005, as Sharpe first took office in November 2004 and cast his first budgetary votes in September 2005. Taking this into account, the overall county property tax revenue actually increased by nearly 8 percent during Sharpe's tenure."}
