{"Praying mantis egg cases have been found on occasion on Christmas trees": "but it is not a common or dangerous problem. Christmas tree farms take precautions to prevent \"harmless hitchhikers\" and only 1 in 100,000 Christmas trees has a post-harvest pest.", "A photograph showing a praying mantis egg case on a Christmas tree is frequently shared on social media during the holiday season": "While the picture is authentic and shows a praying mantis egg case on a Christmas tree, it may give the false impression that this is a common or dangerous occurrence.", "Horticulture experts": "such as Chris Enroth from the University of Illinois Extension, and Doug Hundley from the National Christmas Tree Association, confirm that finding mantis egg cases on Christmas trees is rare. They emphasize that Christmas tree farms utilize Integrated Pest Management (IPM) practices to manage pest populations in a smart and environmentally friendly way.", "Claims made by a pest control company in 2017": "stating that \"as many as 25,000 bugs can live in one tree,\" were quickly debunked by entomologists. Adam Dale, an assistant professor of entomology at the University of Florida, clarified that such claims were exaggerated and not supported by scientific evidence."}
