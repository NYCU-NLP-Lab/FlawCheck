{"The claim is supported by a specific source": "The claim made in the ad is supported by an article from the Washington Times, published on September 9, 2010. The article states that the Department of Energy acknowledged that a significant portion of green energy programs and manufacturing tax credits went to foreign firms, including those in China, South Korea, and Spain.", "The source provides specific numbers": "The Washington Times article mentions that as much as 80 percent of some green energy programs, including $2.3 billion in manufacturing tax credits, went to foreign firms. Additionally, a report by American University\u2019s Investigative Reporting Workshop stated that more than 79 percent of the first $2.1 billion in stimulus grants to wind energy companies went to foreign firms.", "The claim is attributed to a specific individual or organization": "The claim is made in a TV ad by Josh Mandel, the Republican candidate running against Sherrod Brown. The ad features an announcer speaking the claim alongside a photo of Sherrod Brown and a blended collage of flags from Panama, China, and South Korea.", "Counter": "evidence is presented: The PolitiFact Ohio expert notes that the Washington Times article does not mention Sherrod Brown specifically. However, it highlights that Brown was actually one of the senators who called for the suspension of the program until it could be fixed to ensure funds flow to projects creating jobs in the United States. This counter-evidence challenges the claim made in the ad."}
