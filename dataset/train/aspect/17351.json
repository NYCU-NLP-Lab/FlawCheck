{"The percentage of female workers": "The expert's verdict confirms that Nike workers in Vietnam are indeed 80 percent female, which verifies the claim made in the statement.", "Working hours": "The expert's verdict states that working between 70 and 80 hours per week is not typical for a Nike worker in Vietnam. This contradicts the claim that workers in Vietnam work 70 to 80 hours per week, suggesting that the claim may not be entirely accurate.", "Wages": "The expert's verdict acknowledges that wages were around 20 cents per hour in the mid-1990s but have increased since then. This partially supports the claim that Nike workers in Vietnam earn 20 cents per hour, although it suggests that the information may be outdated.", "Forced labor": "The expert's verdict mentions that some Nike workers in Vietnam are illegally forced to labor more than the statutory working week of 48 hours. This verifies the claim that there are instances of forced labor among Nike workers in Vietnam."}
