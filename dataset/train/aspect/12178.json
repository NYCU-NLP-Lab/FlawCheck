{"The claim is based on a scene from the South Korean television show": "My Secret Terrius\" that supposedly showed characters using the word \"coronavirus.\" This scene is authentic and was aired in 2018.", "The claim suggests that the show predicted the 2020 COVID": "19 outbreak. However, coronaviruses have been known to scientists since the 1960s, and there have been previous outbreaks like MERS in 2012 and SARS in 2002. Therefore, the concept of a coronavirus outbreak is not a new or prophetic idea.", "The fictional coronavirus portrayed in the show is different from the actual COVID": "19 strain. In the show, the virus was \"tweaked\" to be more deadly, which is not scientifically possible. COVID-19 is not a human-made bioweapon, as debunked conspiracy theories have suggested.", "The mortality rate of the fictional coronavirus in the show is portrayed as 90": "while the actual fatality rate of COVID-19 varies by country and other factors. The show's portrayal does not accurately reflect the real-world fatality rate, which has been observed to be lower, ranging from 1% to 11% depending on the circumstances."}
