{"Comparison with legitimate news outlets": "The expert compared the claim made by the Baltimore Gazette with legitimate news outlets such as the Washington Post, which had published articles explaining how Hillary Clinton had meticulously prepared for the debate. This comparison helped to verify the authenticity of the claim.", "Examination of leaked information": "The expert mentioned that there were multiple reports and leaked information from inside the Clinton camp claiming that the campaign had received the entire set of debate questions a week before the actual debate. This examination of leaked information added weight to the claim's authenticity.", "Investigation of the source": "The expert analyzed the source of the claim, the Baltimore Gazette, and pointed out several factors that indicated it was not a legitimate news organization. These factors included generic features on the website, non-existent social media presence, and a fake physical address. This investigation discredited the source and raised doubts about the claim's authenticity.", "Lack of corroborating evidence": "The expert highlighted that there was no substantial evidence or corroboration to support the claim. The only mention of an NBC intern delivering a package to Clinton's campaign headquarters came from the Baltimore Gazette, which was deemed unreliable. This lack of corroborating evidence weakened the claim's credibility."}
