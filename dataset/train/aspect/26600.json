{"The expert": "s verdict emphasizes that neither House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi nor Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer support abolishing ICE, contrary to what is implied by the ad. This discrepancy further questions the authenticity of the claim.", "The expert points out that the claim misuses a short clip of Democratic candidate Clarke Tucker at a rally": "where he was asked about his position on ICE. The ad falsely portrays Tucker as wanting to abolish ICE, while in reality, Tucker has expressed support for ICE and homeland security agencies in carrying out their mission.", "Furthermore": "the expert highlights that the claim is made by the Republican Majority Fund, which falsely accuses Tucker of being on the side of \"Hollywood liberals\" and \"Washington politicians\" who want to get rid of ICE. This additional attack on Tucker's stance further raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim."}
