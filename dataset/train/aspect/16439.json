{"The verses in question were not actually": "removed\" from the NIV Bible, but rather relocated to same-page footnotes. This was done to distinguish between older and newer versions of biblical texts.", "The claim made by musician Erica Campbell on Facebook": "stating that 45 complete verses and 64,575 words had been removed from the NIV Bible, is not accurate. While there may be differences in the arrangement and translation of some verses compared to other versions, this does not indicate an effort to entirely eliminate those verses from the Bible.", "The Bible is a compilation of various manuscripts written in different times and places": "all subject to variation and translation. There is no single \"original Bible\" housed in one location. Scholars and translators rely on a composite made from the oldest and most reliable ancient manuscripts, which are found in museums and other places worldwide.", "English translations of the Bible can vary due to the complexity of translating the original Hebrew": "Aramaic, and Greek texts into English. Different translators may choose slightly different renditions of the text, considering the nuances and shades of meaning in today's English. Therefore, it is expected that there will continue to be further English translations as translators strive to accurately convey the intended message."}
