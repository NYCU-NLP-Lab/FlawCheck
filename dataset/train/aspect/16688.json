This definition includes specific conditions that must be met for a position to be considered a job opening. By examining this definition, the expert could determine if Rubio's claim aligns with the criteria set by the BLS.", "Consideration of job turnover and hiring processes": "The expert highlighted the phenomenon of job turnover, where people change jobs, even in a healthy economy.
