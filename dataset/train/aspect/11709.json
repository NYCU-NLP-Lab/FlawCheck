{"Social media claims": "The expert examined the claims made by social media users regarding the photo of the Badaun rape victim. This included analyzing tweets, Facebook posts, and other online sources where the photo was shared.", "Age difference": "The expert noted that there was a significant age difference between the actual victim in the Badaun rape case (a 50-year-old woman) and the woman depicted in the viral photo (claimed to be between 20 and 25 years old). This inconsistency raised doubts about the authenticity of the photo.", "Reverse image search": "The expert conducted a reverse image search and found that the viral photo had been circulating since December 2018. The photo was initially associated with a different case in Uttar Pradesh and later linked to the Unnao rape incident. This discovery suggested that the photo was not related to the recent Badaun rape case.", "Corroborating news reports": "The expert found news reports from December 2018 that described a separate incident in Uttar Pradesh involving the murder of a girl. The details of this case, including the location and the names of the accused, did not match the Badaun rape case. This information further discredited the claim that the viral photo was of the Badaun rape victim."}
