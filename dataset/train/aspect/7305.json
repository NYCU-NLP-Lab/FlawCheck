{"The expert": "s verdict mentions that the Clinton-Kaine campaign provided evidence of 16 instances since June 2015 when Trump said that some unauthorized immigrants crossing the Mexican border into the U.S. are hardened criminals and rapists. This suggests that the claim of Trump saying \"all Mexicans are rapists\" is based on multiple instances of his statements.", "The expert also mentions that Trump": "s statements about Mexican immigration have been discredited in fact checks. This indicates that there is a body of evidence and analysis available that contradicts Trump's claims.", "The expert states that there is no evidence to support Trump": "s repeated claims that the Mexican government is sending violent criminals to the U.S. This suggests that there is a lack of credible information or data supporting Trump's assertions.", "The expert mentions that there is strong evidence indicating that unauthorized Latino immigrants usually come to the U": "S. looking for jobs and to reunite with families that are already there. This implies that the motivations and behaviors of unauthorized immigrants do not align with Trump's characterization of them as rapists."}
