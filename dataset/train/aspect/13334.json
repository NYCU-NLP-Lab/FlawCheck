{"The official announcement on KFC": "s social media accounts: The claim was verified by the fact that KFC made the announcement about the Extra Crispy Sunscreen on their official social media accounts. This suggests that the promotion was indeed offered by KFC.", "Confirmation from KFC": "s Chief Marketing Officer: Kevin Hochman, the chief marketing officer for KFC U.S., confirmed the authenticity of the product in a press release. This adds credibility to the claim as it comes directly from a high-ranking representative of KFC.", "Limited availability and high demand": "The fact that KFC produced only 3,000 bottles of the chicken-scented sunscreen and that they were claimed within a few hours of the announcement supports the authenticity of the claim. The limited availability and high demand indicate that there was a real promotion happening.", "Labeling and disclaimer": "The labeling on the product itself, stating that it is not a food product and should not be eaten, adds another layer of verification. The disclaimer reinforces that the Extra Crispy Sunscreen is a real product but emphasizes that it is not meant to be consumed. This detail further supports the authenticity of the claim."}
