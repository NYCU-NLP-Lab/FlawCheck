{"The expert analyzed historical wage data and found that wages": "once adjusted for inflation, have gone up both in the recent past and the longer term. This contradicts the claim that paychecks aren't keeping up with the cost of living.", "The expert examined the primary statistic for measuring wages": "which is median usual weekly real earnings for full-time wage and salary workers, age 16 and up. This measurement of wages has risen and fallen every quarter since 1979, indicating that there have been periods of wage growth.", "The expert pointed out that wage gains have exceeded inflation for lower": "income workers as well as higher-income workers since 2014. This suggests that paychecks are indeed keeping up with inflation for a significant portion of the workforce.", "The expert cited various data sources": "including average weekly earnings of private-sector production and nonsupervisory employees, median household income, and the analysis of Jed Kolko, the chief economist for Indeed.com. All these sources agree that paychecks are keeping up with inflation, further undermining the claim made by Sen. Kamala Harris."}
