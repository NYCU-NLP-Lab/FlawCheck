{"Lack of evidence": "The expert's verdict states that there is no evidence to support the claim that Nancy Pelosi purchased stock in foreign oil companies before the Keystone pipeline project was halted on January 20. This lack of evidence undermines the authenticity of the claim.", "Transaction report": "Pelosi's transaction report filed on January 21 does not list any trades involving oil companies. This official record contradicts the claim and further verifies its inauthenticity.", "Media coverage": "No media outlet has reported on such a transaction, indicating that there is no credible information or news sources supporting the claim. The absence of media coverage adds to the doubt surrounding the claim's authenticity.", "Pelosi": "s staff statement: Drew Hammill, deputy chief of staff for Pelosi, explicitly stated that the claim is false and clarified that Pelosi does not own any stocks. This statement from Pelosi's staff serves as a direct contradiction to the claim and provides additional evidence against its authenticity."}
