{"Kris Kobach": "s claim of voter fraud in New Hampshire is based on the fact that several thousand people who registered to vote on Election Day with an out-of-state driver's license have not obtained a New Hampshire driver's license or registered a vehicle in the state.", "The expert argues that this is not conclusive evidence of voter fraud": "as it is plausible that most of these voters were college students who are allowed to vote in New Hampshire even if they only live in the state part of the year.", "The expert also points out that Kobach": "s claim is based on statistics released by the Speaker of the New Hampshire House of Representatives, which show that only 1,014 out of the 6,540 same-day registrants with out-of-state licenses had obtained a New Hampshire driver's license as of August 30, 2017.", "Furthermore": "out of the 5,526 individuals who did not obtain a New Hampshire driver's license, only 213 registered a vehicle in the state, suggesting that these voters may not be bona fide residents of New Hampshire."}
