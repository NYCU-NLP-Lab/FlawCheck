{"The expert analyzed the historical data from the U": "S. Bureau of Labor Statistics to verify the claim. They found that in 2007, when the minimum wage was raised in Illinois, the state actually added approximately 48,000 jobs overall, contradicting the claim of job loss.", "The expert examined the specific reference made by Senator Dale Righter": "who claimed that Illinois lost 50,000 jobs after the minimum wage increase in 2006. Upon further investigation, it was revealed that the 50,000 figure referred to the increase in unemployment, not job loss. This clarification undermines the claim's argument.", "The expert considered the broader economic context": "including the Great Recession, which occurred shortly after the minimum wage increase in 2006. They pointed out that many states, regardless of their minimum wage policies, experienced comparable increases in unemployment rates during that time. This suggests that attributing job loss solely to the minimum wage increase may be an oversimplification.", "The expert highlighted the need for a more appropriate comparison period": "They argued that instead of comparing employment in 2007 to 2006, it would be more meaningful to compare it to 2008, considering the mid-year effective date of the dollar increase. This perspective challenges the validity of the claim's timeframe and its correlation to job loss."}
