{"The expert": "s verdict includes a statement from Sen. John Barrasso claiming that the American Rescue Plan Act stimulus checks would go to people in prison and illegal immigrants.", "The expert notes that Barrasso": "s claim is misleading, as stimulus checks are not going to the estimated 10.5 million immigrants living in the U.S. illegally. Instead, Barrasso's office clarified that he was referring to the potential for a specific subset of immigrants who overstayed a work visa to receive the checks.", "The expert highlights that Barrasso": "s claim contradicts his previous votes in favor of COVID-19 relief bills, such as the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act and the Consolidated Appropriations Act, which also did not prohibit payments to prisoners.", "The expert explains that individuals who qualify for the stimulus checks need to meet income requirements and provide a Social Security number to the IRS": "The bill explicitly states that \"any nonresident alien individual\" is not eligible for the payments, which aligns with the language used in previous relief bills."}
