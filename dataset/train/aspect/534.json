Aubrey surfaced on the internet. This physical evidence suggests that there was a communication between Kubrick and Aubrey regarding the potential sequel.", "Kubrick": "s threat of legal action and ownership of a prop: In the letter, Kubrick mentions that his attorney informed him that legally there was little he could do to stop a sequel. However, he asserts his ownership of a prop from the original film and threatens to use it against Aubrey if a sequel is made. This suggests that Kubrick had strong objections to the idea of a sequel.", "Lack of aggression and profanity in other correspondence": "The expert mentions that the aggressive and profane tone of the letter is not consistent with other known correspondence from Kubrick. This raises doubts about the authenticity of the letter, as it deviates from Kubrick's usual communication style."}
