{"The claim is supported by the analysis conducted by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center": "which found that under Trump's tax plan, the highest-income households would receive the largest tax cuts, both in dollars and as a percentage of income.", "Another analysis conducted by the liberal Citizens for Tax Justice also supports the claim": "showing that the top 0.1 percent of taxpayers would receive a significant portion of Trump's proposed tax cuts, while the bottom 60 percent would receive a smaller portion.", "The Tax Policy Center": "s report from June 2015 further supports the claim by stating that the top 0.1 percent of taxpayers already pay a significant share of all individual income taxes, indicating that they would benefit more from Trump's tax plan.", "Alan Cole": "an economist with the Tax Foundation, corroborated the claim by running the numbers and confirming that the wealthiest individuals would receive significant tax cuts under Trump's plan."}
