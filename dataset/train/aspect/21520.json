{"Lack of media reports confirming the alleged invitation": "The expert found no media reports confirming that Manmohan Singh had been invited to Joe Biden's swearing-in ceremony. They conducted a keyword search on Google and found no credible sources supporting the claim. If an Indian leader had been invited to such an event, it would have received widespread media coverage.", "Official information about the ceremony": "The expert found an article in The New York Times stating that only American officials and well-known public figures would be participating in Joe Biden's swearing-in ceremony. The Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremony (JCCIC) is organizing the event, and their press release from July 2020 did not mention any list of attendees or invitations.", "Confirmation from Daman Singh": "The expert reached out to Daman Singh, the daughter of Manmohan Singh, to inquire about the claim. She informed them that her father had no knowledge of being invited to Joe Biden's inauguration, suggesting that the claim was not true.", "Rubbishing of the claim by media outlets": "The expert mentioned that a number of media outlets had already debunked the claim of Manmohan Singh being invited to the swearing-in ceremony. This further adds to the lack of credibility surrounding the claim."}
