{"The claim incorrectly identifies the law as the": "McCarran Warner Act of 1952\" when it is actually called the McCarran-Walter Act or the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952. This discrepancy casts doubt on the accuracy of the claim.", "The McCarran": "Walter Act was primarily focused on immigration policies and did not specifically mention religion or Muslims. Therefore, it does not contain any provisions forbidding Muslims from holding office.", "The law aimed to regulate immigration by implementing a quota system and preferences based on skill sets and family reunification": "Its purpose was to restrict immigration from certain countries and not to target any specific religious group.", "The claim falsely associates prominent politicians like Dick Cheney": "Nancy Pelosi, John McCain, Joe Biden, Al Gore, John Kerry, Mitch McConnell, and Chuck Schumer with the repeal of the law. However, there is no evidence to support this connection, further undermining the credibility of the claim."}
