{"The claim states that": "West Virginia spends more tax dollars on public education than all but 13 other states and the District of Columbia.\" The first aspect employed to verify the authenticity of this claim is the reference to the 2016 Annual Survey of School System Finances published by the U.S. Census Bureau. This report is considered a reliable source of data on education spending.", "The second aspect involves examining the raw dollars spent on public education in West Virginia": "By looking at Table 3 in the report, it is found that West Virginia ranked 13th lowest among the 50 states in terms of dollars spent. This contradicts the claim that West Virginia spends more than all but 13 other states.", "The third aspect involves analyzing expenditures per pupil in West Virginia": "Table 4 in the report shows that West Virginia's spending per pupil is around the national average, not among the top 13 states as claimed. In fact, there are 22 states that spend more per pupil than West Virginia.", "The fourth aspect involves considering the factor of state size": "The expert points out that the 12 states ranking below West Virginia in terms of expenditures are all small states. This suggests that state size is a major factor influencing the level of spending and should be taken into account when comparing education spending across states."}
