{"Outdated information": "The expert's verdict states that the claim made by Donald Trump Jr. was based on a six-year-old story that was no longer accurate. The story had been updated to clarify that only 85 noncitizens were actually removed from the voter rolls in 2012.", "Flawed figure": "The expert's verdict highlights that the figure of \"nearly 200,000 Florida Voters May Not Be Citizens\" was deeply flawed. The original list of 180,000 names was reduced to 2,625, and further checks revealed only 85 noncitizens were ultimately removed from the rolls.", "Editor": "s note: The expert's verdict mentions that an editor's note was posted at the top of the story before Donald Trump Jr. tweeted about it. This note made it clear that the figure from state officials was inaccurate, indicating that the claim was not based on the most up-to-date information.", "Errors in the initial list": "The expert's verdict explains that the initial list of 180,000 names of potential noncitizens on Florida's voter rolls was found to contain errors.
