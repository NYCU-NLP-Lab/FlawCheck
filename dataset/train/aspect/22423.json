{"Lack of coal production in Michigan": "The expert found that Michigan is not one of the states that currently produce coal, according to the National Mining Association. This suggests that the claim of losing 50,000 jobs due to the \"Obama-Clinton war on coal\" is unlikely.", "Inconsistent number of mining workers": "The Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows that the number of workers engaged in mining in Michigan over the past decade has varied between 5,000 and 7,000. This makes it highly improbable for the state to have lost 50,000 existing jobs in the mining sector.", "Low number of electricity generation sector workers": "Michigan currently has fewer than 20,000 people working in the electricity generation sector, as noted by the Washington Examiner. This further questions the scale of job losses claimed by Trump.", "Reference to a five": "year-old news release: Trump's speech included a footnote that pointed to a news release from the National Mining Association published in 2011. The news release criticized the \"Beyond Coal\" campaign and mentioned potential job losses in Michigan. However, it is unclear how relevant this information is to the current claim and whether it accurately represents the job losses in the state."}
