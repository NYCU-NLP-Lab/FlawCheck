{"Lack of specific details": "The expert notes that the original claim does not provide any specific details or name the \"Muslim figure\" involved, which raises doubts about its authenticity.", "Use of unrelated images": "The claim includes a picture of Fusion correspondent Alaa Basatneh, taken from a November 2016 interview, which has no relevance to the story. This suggests that the image was used to misrepresent the claim and create a false narrative.", "Misrepresentation of a news story": "The expert points out that the claim is actually a misrepresentation of a news story from France, which has no mention of any specific actions in the United States. This further undermines the credibility of the claim.", "Inconsistent and clickbaity sources": "The expert highlights that the claim was spread by dubious and clickbaity websites with names like \"Freedom Writers\" and \"USA Life Buzz\", which are known for publishing sensationalized and unreliable content. This indicates that the sources promoting the claim lack credibility."}
