{"The expert used a study conducted by the Brookings Institution in 2014 that ranked the top 10 and bottom 10 cities by income inequality": "The study was updated in March 2015, and the expert referred to the updated list based on 2013 data.", "The expert found that out of the 10 most unequal cities identified in the study": "nine had Democratic mayors. These cities included Atlanta, San Francisco, Boston, Washington, New York, Dallas, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Minneapolis. Only one city, Miami, had a Republican mayor.", "On the other hand": "the expert discovered that out of the 10 most equal cities in terms of income inequality, five had Republican mayors. These cities were Albuquerque, Oklahoma City, Mesa (Arizona), Colorado Springs (Colorado), and Virginia Beach (Virginia). The remaining five cities either had nonpartisan mayors or Democratic mayors.", "The expert emphasized that while mayoral policies may have some effect on economic inequality in cities": "there are many other factors at play. These factors include the state and national business cycle, broad demographic patterns, and international business trends. Population size and geographic patterns were also mentioned as important factors influencing inequality patterns in cities, potentially overshadowing the impact of partisan leadership."}
