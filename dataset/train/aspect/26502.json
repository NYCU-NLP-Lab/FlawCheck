{"The expert": "s investigation also found that Patrick was not the only legislator to oppose the measure. Representative Matt Schaefer, a Republican from Tyler, was recorded as the \"no\" vote when the proposal cleared the House Committee on Military & Veterans Affairs. Additionally, five House members asked to be recorded as voting against preliminary approval of the legislation, even though they were initially recorded as voting \"yes.\"", "Patrick": "s campaign manager, Logan Spence, provided an explanation for Patrick's vote against the proposal. Spence stated that Patrick voted against it because he believed it would expand the state's bureaucracy with a new function that could be more efficiently handled by a different agency. The non-partisan House Research Organization also mentioned opponents' concerns that the legislation was unnecessary because similar assistance was already offered by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs."}
