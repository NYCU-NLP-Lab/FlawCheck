{"The claim is based on a viral Facebook video and articles from right": "leaning websites, which may indicate a biased perspective and potential misinformation.", "The claim misrepresents the California Department of Education": "s proposed Health Education Framework, which actually includes guidelines to educate first-grade students, not kindergartners, about growth and development.", "The claim falsely states that parents will not be notified and cannot opt their children out of the supposed indoctrination sessions": "which contradicts the guidelines that emphasize partnering with families and recognizing the role of parents, guardians, and caretakers in education.", "The claim exaggerates the content of the educational resources": "suggesting that they teach children to reject gender stereotypes and embrace a wide range of gender options, including the existence of at least 15 genders, and that it is impossible to determine a baby's gender, which may not accurately reflect the actual content of the resources."}
