{"Expert opinions": "The expert consulted with several climate scientists who expressed their disbelief and criticized the claim, stating that it was laughable, misguided, uninformed, disgusting, and absurd.", "Scientific consensus": "The expert highlighted the overwhelming consensus among respected scientists that anthropogenic (human-caused) global warming is indisputable. They cited studies that found at least 97% of actively publishing climate researchers believe in anthropogenic climate change.", "Expertise of contrarian scientists": "The expert pointed out that the few scientists denying human-caused climate change are a vocal but small minority. They also noted that these contrarian scientists tend to have less expertise in the subject compared to those who believe in it.", "Consensus among earth scientists": "The expert referenced a survey conducted among more than 3,000 earth scientists, where 82% of respondents believed that global temperature shifts are human-caused. Among climate-specific earth scientists, the percentage rose to 97.4%. This survey further supports the consensus on human-caused climate change among experts in the field."}
