{"The claim was found to be a hoax as the same image had previously appeared on a Spanish": "language website, suggesting that the catch was actually in Spain rather than Homosassa, Florida.", "A reverse image search on Google suggested that the photograph was originally uploaded in 2010 and could have been taken or altered much earlier": "The picture was hosted on a website for a fishing club in the Florida Keys, indicating that if such a large catch had occurred, it would have been mentioned by avid sport fishermen.", "The Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission published a status update reporting the capture of a large shrimp": "like creature measuring 18 inches long in the Indian River near Fort Pierce, Florida. However, the photographs of this catch did not match the circulating \"102 lb. shrimp\" image, and the documented catch did not provide any weight information.", "Professor Roy Caldwell": "a biologist specializing in integrative biology, stated that the creature depicted in the circulating image belonged to a species of Lysiosquilla, which is not technically a shrimp. He explained that Lysiosquilla species typically have a distinct yellow and black banding pattern and can grow up to 12 inches long, but they are not the largest of stomatopod species. This suggested that the claim of a 102-lb. shrimp was highly unlikely."}
