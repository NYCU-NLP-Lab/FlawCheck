{"The expert examined the chronology of restrictions placed on religious practices by the Ontario government to determine if Catholic churches were specifically targeted": "They found that this was not the case, as similar restrictions applied to other religious faiths as well.", "The expert highlighted that Catholic churches in Toronto had been closed since March and gradually began reopening in mid": "June. All places of worship were subject to similar restrictions imposed by the provincial government until June 12.", "The expert mentioned the modifications made by the Archdiocese of Toronto in conducting the sacrament of Holy Communion": "These modifications included receiving communion only in the hand, wearing masks while lining up and during the moment of receiving the Host, and maintaining a distance of 2 meters (6 ft.) from others.", "The expert referred to the statement of Neil McCarthy": "the director of public relations for the archdiocese, who confirmed that Catholics had been practicing a modified version of communion since at least mid-June. This suggests that the claim of a complete ban on Catholic churches carrying out the sacrament of Holy Communion in Toronto was not accurate."}
