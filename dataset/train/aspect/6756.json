{"The claim made by Republican Party of Florida chairman Joe Gruters is that": "all the Democrats on the entire stage\" during the first Democratic presidential debate said they want to give free health care to undocumented immigrants.", "The expert": "s verdict highlights that during the debate, candidates were asked to raise their hands if their government plan would provide coverage for undocumented immigrants, but they were not specifically asked if that coverage would be free.", "The expert also notes that candidates Pete Buttigieg and Joe Biden": "who were asked to comment on the issue, did not say they would give \"free\" health care to undocumented immigrants. Buttigieg emphasized the concept of people buying into a system and referred to it as an insurance program, while Biden spoke about the contributions made by undocumented immigrants, including paying taxes.", "The expert concludes that the claim made by Gruters is not supported by the debate itself": "as none of the candidates explicitly stated they would provide free health care to undocumented immigrants. The expert also mentions that a similar attack by President Donald Trump using this claim was rated Mostly False by PolitiFact."}
