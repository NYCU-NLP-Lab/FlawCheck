{"The photo": "s origin and context: The expert verified that the photo was taken in 2014 at a US Customs and Border Protection facility in Texas. It was provided to the Houston Chronicle by US Representative Henry Cuellar for an article about overcrowded immigrant facilities during a surge in border crossings. This information confirmed that the photo was not recent and was not related to the migrant caravans from Central America.", "Identification of the skin condition": "The expert determined that the rash on the man's torso was likely a case of scabies, a contagious but treatable skin disease caused by mites. This identification debunked the claim that the man had smallpox.", "Smallpox eradication": "The expert confirmed that smallpox was officially declared eradicated during the 33rd World Health Assembly. They also mentioned that the last person to die of smallpox was in 1978. This information proved that the claim of the man having smallpox was false.", "Tuberculosis vaccine availability": "The expert clarified that there is a vaccine for tuberculosis called Bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG), which is given to children in countries where the disease is highly prevalent. They also mentioned that the BCG vaccine is not often recommended for use in the United States. This information contradicted the claim that there is no vaccine for tuberculosis and that half of the migrant caravan members were infected with it."}
