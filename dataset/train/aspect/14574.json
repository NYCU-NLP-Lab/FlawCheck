{"The FBI forensic report": "The expert's verdict mentions that an FBI forensic report of Seth Rich's computer was generated within 96 hours after his murder. This report showed that Rich made contact with WikiLeaks through Gavin MacFadyen, a deceased investigative journalist associated with WikiLeaks. The report's existence and findings provide evidence to support the claim.", "Testimony of a federal investigator": "The expert's verdict includes a statement from an anonymous federal investigator who claims to have seen and read the emails between Seth Rich and WikiLeaks. This testimony supports the claim that Rich sent thousands of leaked emails to WikiLeaks before his murder.", "Confirmation by private investigator": "The expert's verdict mentions the findings of a private investigation firm hired by a third party on behalf of Rich's family. The firm's investigator, Rod Wheeler, states that his investigation shows some degree of email exchange between Rich and WikiLeaks. This confirmation from a separate investigation further supports the claim.", "Timing and circumstances": "The expert's verdict highlights the timing and circumstances surrounding Seth Rich's murder and the subsequent release of hacked emails by WikiLeaks. Rich was shot twice in the back in July 2016, and almost two weeks later, WikiLeaks released a batch of hacked emails that caused media frenzy and embarrassed the DNC. The close proximity of these events raises suspicions and adds weight to the claim that Rich may have been involved in leaking the emails."}
