{"FBI Director James Comey": "s statement: The expert cites FBI Director James Comey's statement, where he confirms that the FBI conducted two preliminary investigations on Omar Mateen and took several actions, including recording his conversations, following him, introducing him to confidential sources, and reviewing his communication records. This statement contradicts the claim that the FBI was prevented from investigating Mateen due to political correctness.", "Lack of evidence": "The expert points out that the claim made by the NRA's chief lobbyist, Chris Cox, is unsubstantiated. Cox alleges that political correctness prevented the FBI from fully investigating Mateen, but he fails to provide any evidence to support this claim.", "Comey": "s assessment of the FBI's actions: Comey states that, based on their review of their own work, he does not believe that the FBI agents should have done anything differently regarding their investigations of Mateen. This assessment suggests that the FBI conducted a thorough investigation and did not neglect any potential threats due to political correctness.", "Lack of response from NRA": "ILA: The expert mentions that they reached out to NRA-ILA spokeswoman Amy Hunter to inquire about the evidence Cox has regarding political correctness hindering the FBI's investigation of Mateen. However, they did not receive a response, indicating a lack of supporting evidence for the claim."}
