{"Testimony from experts": "The expert's verdict is based on the testimony of Todd Harrison, a senior fellow in defense budget studies at the independent Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments. Harrison confirms that health care expenses are indeed the fastest-growing part of the Pentagon's budget.", "Nonpartisan research": "The expert refers to a report released by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) that found a 130 percent increase in the cost of providing health care to service members, retirees, and their families from 2000 to 2012. This research supports the claim that health care expenses in the Pentagon's budget have been growing rapidly.", "Projected budget figures": "The expert mentions that for fiscal year 2016, the military's projected health care costs are expected to total $48 billion. This provides concrete evidence of the significant financial resources allocated to health care within the Pentagon's budget.", "Historical comparison": "The expert highlights that military health care costs have grown from being just 4 percent of the Department of Defense (DoD) budget in 1990 to 10 percent today. This historical comparison demonstrates the substantial increase in the proportion of the budget allocated to health care expenses over time."}
