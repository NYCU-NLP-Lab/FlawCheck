This allowed for a comprehensive analysis of the incarceration rates.", "The expert found that at the end of 2013": "there were approximately 5,700 women inmates in jails and prisons in Virginia, which increased to around 6,700 in June 2018. This represents an 18% increase in female incarceration over the 4 \u00bd-year span, contrasting with the claim of a 300% surge.", "The expert discovered that the number of male prisoners in Virginia actually decreased by 1": "4% during the same period, from about 51,200 to 50,500. This divergence in trends between male and female incarceration rates is a significant finding that challenges the claim made by Del. Kaye Kory.", "The expert also investigated the origin of the claim and found that Del": "Kaye Kory initially misspoke on radio, stating a 300% increase when she meant to refer to a five-fold increase in female incarceration nationally since 2001.
