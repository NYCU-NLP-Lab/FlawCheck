{"The amount of mercury in a CFL bulb": "The expert mentions that an average CFL bulb contains 4 milligrams of mercury, which is about enough to cover the tip of a ballpoint pen. This information is provided by the National Electrical Manufacturers Association.", "Comparison with other sources of mercury": "The expert also highlights that older glass thermometers contain about 500 milligrams of mercury, which is significantly higher than the amount found in a CFL bulb. This information is also provided by the National Electrical Manufacturers Association.", "Lack of specific instructions on handling broken CFL bulbs": "The expert mentions that some of the environmental agency websites cited by Del. Bob Marshall do not specifically provide instructions on how to handle a broken CFL bulb. This suggests that there may be a lack of consensus or clarity on whether throwing away contaminated shoes is necessary.", "Legislative context and conservative protest": "The expert mentions the background context of the debate over CFL use, including the passing of a law requiring greater energy efficiency from light bulbs and the conservative protest against government regulations. This context helps to understand the motivations behind Del. Bob Marshall's claim and the potential biases involved."}
