This adds credibility to the claim.", "Confirmation by a scientist": "The expert mentions a blog post by scientist Mike Jech, who confirms the capture of three large strawberry squid during a research cruise. This firsthand account further supports the authenticity of the claim.", "Historical observations": "The expert mentions that cockeyed squid, to which the strawberry squid belongs, have been observed and studied by marine scientists for several decades.
