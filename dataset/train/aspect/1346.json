{"Comparison to other Midwest states": "The claim is verified by comparing Wisconsin's job creation numbers to those of other Midwest states, specifically Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Iowa, Ohio, and Illinois. This comparison is based on the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' Current Employment Statistics for the period of July 2013 to July 2014.", "Raw number of jobs created": "The claim is based on the raw number of jobs created in Wisconsin during the specified time frame (36,100 jobs). This measurement is used by Governor Scott Walker as his measuring stick, rather than the percentage increase preferred by economists.", "Adjustment for data accuracy": "The claim acknowledges that the data used for comparison is preliminary and will be adjusted in one month. A Bureau of Labor Statistics official confirms that comparing the July 2014 figure to the July 2013 figure is reasonable, but cautions that the July 2014 figure will change.", "Use of different measures": "The claim highlights that while the raw number of jobs created places Wisconsin third in the Midwest, even when using the percentage growth measure, Wisconsin only slips to fourth-highest among the 10 Midwest states. This aspect emphasizes that Wisconsin's job growth is still competitive, even when considering the varying size of states."}
