{"The claim is based on a study conducted by the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research": "titled \"The Fading American Dream: Trends in Absolute Income Mobility since 1940.\" The study analyzed millions of Internal Revenue Service records and Census data to compare income between parents and children.", "The study": "s findings show that the percentage of children earning more than their parents has decreased significantly. It reveals that 90 percent of people born in the 1940s ended up doing better financially than their parents, while only 50 percent of those born in the 1980s have a chance of doing better.", "The study accounted for various factors such as inflation": "taxes, and other changes between the generations to provide a comprehensive analysis of income mobility.", "While the study supports the claim about the declining financial prospects of millennials": "it does not directly address the assertion that they are the \"best-educated generation in our history.\" However, a separate survey conducted by the Pew Research Center found that a significant percentage of millennials had completed at least a bachelor's degree by age 33, supporting the claim about their educational attainment."}
