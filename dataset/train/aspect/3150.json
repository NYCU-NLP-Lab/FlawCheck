{"Lack of official estimate": "The expert mentions that they sought an official estimate from the El Paso Police Department and the city government of El Paso, but none was provided. This suggests that there is no official count available to verify the claim.", "Media reports": "The expert refers to media reports that suggested the number of attendees at O'Rourke's speech was in the thousands. Specifically, the Texas Tribune reporters mentioned that about 7,000 people attended the event, according to an aide who cited law enforcement. This indicates that there were significantly more than the 200 to 300 people claimed by Trump.", "Photographic and video footage": "The expert reviewed photographic and video footage of the event. They mention freeze-frame images shared by O'Rourke on Twitter, which showed a crowd extending beyond the claimed number. Additionally, a livestream video published by the El Paso Times, although having a narrower perspective, also suggested a larger crowd than what Trump stated.", "Disagreement with Trump": "s estimate: The expert mentions that law enforcement officials disagreed with Trump's claim of 35,000 attendees at his own rally. An El Paso Fire Department spokesman stated that the venue where Trump spoke holds 6,500 people, and it was filled to capacity. This discrepancy in estimates further questions the accuracy of Trump's statement."}
