These filings showed that Ted Cruz had raised 35% of his campaign funds from outside the state of Texas.", "The Houston Chronicle story also mentioned that Cruz had received donations from every state except Vermont": "indicating a broad base of support from outside Texas.", "The Texas Tribune conducted an analysis that revealed 39": "of Cruz's itemized individual contributions, totaling $1.5 million, came from out-of-state contributors.
