{"The claim is based on an advertisement by Providence Mayor Angel Taveras attacking Gina Raimondo": "one of her opponents in the Democratic primary for governor. The advertisement portrays two men meeting in secret to shake hands, with the words \"SECRET\" and \"No-bid Contract\" displayed prominently. This aspect verifies that the claim was made in a political advertisement.", "The advertisement alleges that Gina Raimondo": "s venture capital firm secured a secret no-bid contract funded by taxpayers. This aspect verifies the specific claim being made in the advertisement.", "The advertisement references a March 1": "2014 story in The Providence Journal that explored the terms of a 2006 investment made by the city of Providence in Point Judith Capital, a venture capital investment firm co-founded by Raimondo. The story reveals that the city invested $1 million in retirement money with Point Judith, with the investment lasting 10 years. This aspect verifies the existence of the investment and Raimondo's involvement with Point Judith.", "The Providence Journal faced difficulties in obtaining details about the city": "s investment with Point Judith, with several portions of the agreement between the city and the firm redacted when it was finally released. This aspect verifies the lack of transparency surrounding the investment and supports the notion that there may be questionable aspects to the deal."}
