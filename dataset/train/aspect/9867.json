{"The level of foreign ownership of the national debt has been steadily increasing since the 1970s": "with foreigners owning less than 5 percent of the debt until the early 1970s and reaching close to 50 percent by the end of last year.", "The U": "S. Treasury website confirms that by June, more than 30 countries, including China, owned nearly $4 trillion in U.S. debt.", "However": "there is a discrepancy in the calculation of the total U.S. debt, as it does not include nearly $4.5 trillion in \"intragovernmental holdings.\" Considering these holdings would lower the percentage of foreign-held debt to 30 percent.", "The definition of debt remains the same regardless of who it is owed to": "raising the question of whether it is appropriate to consider the entire federal debt before calculating the portion owned by foreigners."}
