In this case, the obituary for Dolores Aguilar deviates from this standard by providing additional information that is not of a laudatory nature.", "Negative portrayal of the deceased": "The expert highlights that the obituary expresses not-so-warm feelings about Dolores Aguilar. It describes her as someone who had no hobbies, made no contribution to society, rarely shared a kind word or deed, and whose presence will not be missed by many. This negative portrayal is distinct from the usual loving expression of facts found in obituaries.", "Lack of mourning and closure": "The obituary states that there will be no service, prayers, or closure for the family, indicating a lack of traditional mourning rituals. It also mentions that Dolores Aguilar spent a lifetime tearing the family apart, implying unresolved conflicts and strained relationships.", "Hope for healing and reconciliation": "The obituary concludes with a statement expressing hope for the rest of the family to come together, heal, and learn to be a family again. This aspect suggests a desire for reconciliation and a fresh start after Dolores Aguilar's passing."}
