{"Availability of renewable energy sources": "The expert mentions that Nevada does have enough geothermal and solar resources to potentially replace fossil-fuel powered plants. However, it is stated that it would take longer than three to four years to achieve this.", "Energy storage capacity": "The expert suggests that if Nevada developed sufficient storage capacity for solar energy, it might be enough to provide 24-hour electricity for homes and businesses.", "Net energy exporter vs": "energy independence: The expert points out that being a net exporter of energy does not necessarily mean being \"energy independent\" because vehicles still require fuel, and Nevada does not have enough oil for that. Converting all vehicles to electric and providing in-state fuel for airplanes would be necessary.", "Timeframe for achieving energy independence": "The expert states that it is conceivable that Nevada might be able to export more energy than it imports over the next seven to ten years, but it is not a true definition of energy independence within the immediate future as claimed by Senator Harry Reid."}
