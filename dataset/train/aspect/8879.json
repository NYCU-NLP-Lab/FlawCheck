{"Discrepancy in language and translation": "The expert notes that the Korean-language version of the claim uses awkward diction and appears to have been translated using automatic software from a French poster. This suggests that the claim may not accurately convey the original intent or message.", "Inaccurate claims and false information": "The expert highlights that the claims made in the poster about Covid-19 vaccination are false. They state that vaccines do not prevent the spread of the virus and that there are more dangers than benefits associated with vaccination. This indicates that the claim contains misleading information.", "Lack of authenticity and origin": "The expert states that the poster is not authentic and provides evidence that it originates from a similar French-language version posted on Facebook. They also mention that the Swiss Federal Office of Public Sanitation (FOPH) has denied any association with the misleading posters. This raises doubts about the credibility and origin of the claim.", "Deviation from genuine vaccination promotion posters": "The expert points out that the claim poster deviates from the style of genuine vaccination promotion posters from the FOPH. While the authentic posters state \"I will get vaccinated,\" the claim poster states \"I will not get vaccinated.\" This inconsistency further questions the authenticity and reliability of the claim."}
