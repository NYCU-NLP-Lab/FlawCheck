{"The expert contacted the representative": "s office and obtained information from Flynn's chief of staff, David Erinakes, who confirmed that there is no dedicated class on the U.S. Constitution as early as first grade. This information verifies the claim that children in Texas do not spend any time in school learning about the U.S. Constitution.", "The expert examined the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills for social studies": "which are curriculum standards outlining what students must be taught in Texas classrooms. The standards include about 35 references to teaching students about the Constitution, starting from fifth grade. This verifies that the U.S. Constitution is indeed part of the curriculum in Texas schools.", "The expert found that in high school": "there is a mandatory U.S. government class that focuses significantly on the U.S. Constitution, its underlying principles, and the form of government it created. This further supports the claim that students in Texas schools do learn about the U.S. Constitution at some point during their education.", "The expert also looked at online versions of the Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills": "TAKS) tests, which assess students' understanding of various subjects. The tests include questions related to the U.S. Constitution, indicating that students are expected to have knowledge of it. This provides additional evidence that the claim about children not spending any time learning about the U.S. Constitution in Texas schools is not accurate."}
