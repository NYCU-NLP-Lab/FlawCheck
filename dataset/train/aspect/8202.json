{"The claim was verified by checking the polling data mentioned by Dick Armey": "a former House Republican leader and organizer of the Tea Party movement. The specific poll referenced was the December 2009 NBC-Wall Street Journal poll.", "The poll asked respondents about their opinion of the Tea Party movement": "with options ranging from very positive to very negative. The results showed that 41 percent of respondents had a positive view of the Tea Party movement, while only 23 percent saw it negatively. This data supported the claim that the Tea Party polls higher than the Republicans and the Democrats.", "However": "some political analysts questioned the accuracy of the poll's results. They suggested that the Tea Party's favorable ratings might be exaggerated due to its heavy coverage on Fox News, a conservative news outlet. They pointed out that about 76 percent of those who viewed the Tea Party favorably also relied on Fox News for their news.", "NBC political editor Chuck Todd expressed skepticism about the Tea Party being in the center of American politics": "contrary to Armey's claim. He mentioned that their own polling data indicated that the Tea Party received a significant benefit from Fox News coverage. This raised doubts about the Tea Party's actual popularity and its position within the political spectrum."}
