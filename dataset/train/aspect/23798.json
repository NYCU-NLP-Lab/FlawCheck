{"The claim inaccurately states that a 12": "year-old rape victim in Alabama would be thrown in prison for receiving an abortion. The expert's verdict clarifies that criminal charges could be brought against doctors who perform abortions under a new law, but not women receiving them.", "The Alabama Human Life Protection Act": "signed by Republican Gov. Kay Ivey on May 15, 2019, would ban most abortions in the state. However, the law is not currently in effect as it has been temporarily blocked by a federal judge.", "The law aims to challenge the 1973 U": "S. Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade, which established a woman's right to an abortion until a fetus becomes viable. The sponsors of the Alabama law believe it may provide an opportunity for the Supreme Court to revisit this matter.", "The Alabama law does not provide exceptions for cases of rape or incest": "It only permits abortions when a physician licensed in Alabama determines that it is necessary to prevent a serious health risk to the mother, and this determination must be confirmed in writing by a second physician. The law defines \"serious health risk\" as a condition that complicates the mother's medical condition and could result in death or substantial physical impairment of a major bodily function. Emotional or mental health conditions do not qualify as serious health risks under the law."}
