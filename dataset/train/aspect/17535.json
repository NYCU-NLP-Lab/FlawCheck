{"The claim was posted on Advance New Zealand": "s Facebook page on December 1, 2020, and has been shared more than 260 times.", "The claim suggests that mRNA vaccines intervene directly in the genetic material of the patient and alter their individual genetic material": "comparing it to genetic manipulation in food.", "The claim states that after receiving an mRNA vaccine": "individuals will no longer be able to treat vaccine symptoms in a complementary way, and if they develop Covid-19 symptoms, they will not be able to be treated due to genetically irreversible damage caused by the vaccination.", "Experts": "including Associate Professor Helen Petousis-Harris, a vaccinologist at the University of Auckland, have stated that the claim is false. RNA vaccines cannot alter or interact with a person's genome as our genes are contained in the nucleus of our cells, and there are no instructions in the vaccine that make it possible. The RNA in the vaccine is taken up by cells at the injection site and broken down into its basic building blocks to be recycled."}
