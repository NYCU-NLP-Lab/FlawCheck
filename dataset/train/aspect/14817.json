{"Calculation of the claim": "The expert explains how the claim is calculated using population estimates from the Census Bureau and employment data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The total U.S. population age 16 and over is subtracted from the number of Americans in the labor force to arrive at the figure of 90 million.", "Inclusion of specific groups": "The expert highlights that the 90 million number includes certain groups of people who wouldn't be expected to be working, such as individuals in high school, enrolled in college, or who have reached retirement age. These groups are enumerated and their numbers are provided.", "Exaggeration of the claim": "The expert concludes that the 90 million number is exaggerated because it includes individuals who are not of normal working age, are in college, or have retired. The actual number of people who are of working age, not in college, and not working is stated to be less than one-quarter of the cited amount.", "Concerns of economists": "The expert mentions that while the claim may be exaggerated, the idea that fewer people are joining the workforce is a concern for economists. They explain that economists prefer to see more people working as it contributes to economic growth, but dropping out of school can limit future employment opportunities and earnings potential. The importance of labor force participation rate and employment to population ratio in gauging these trends is also highlighted."}
