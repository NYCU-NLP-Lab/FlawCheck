{"The discovery of bones on Nikumaroro Island": "The claim is based on the hypothesis that bones found on Nikumaroro Island belong to Amelia Earhart. The expert's verdict mentions that these bones were discovered around 1940 and were initially described as belonging to a stocky Polynesian male, not matching the physical characteristics of Earhart.", "TIGHAR": "s hypothesis: The International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery (TIGHAR) has proposed the theory that Earhart ended up on land, specifically on Nikumaroro Island. They have been actively promoting this theory and have found various artifacts on the island that they believe are associated with Earhart and the human remains found there.", "Lack of widespread support": "The expert's verdict mentions that there are two main hurdles undermining widespread support for the TIGHAR explanation. Firstly, the original description of the bones found on Nikumaroro Island does not match the physical characteristics of Earhart. Secondly, the current whereabouts of the Nikumaroro Bones are unknown, which raises doubts about their authenticity and further verification.", "Unresolved mystery": "Despite extensive searches and investigations, the wreckage of Earhart's plane and the remains of both Earhart and her navigator Fred Noonan have never been conclusively located. The expert's verdict highlights that the mystery surrounding Earhart's disappearance continues to provoke impassioned debate and that she was declared dead in absentia two years after her disappearance."}
