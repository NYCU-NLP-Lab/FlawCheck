{"The entry posted on a WordPress blog entitled": "Joel Osteen Ministries\" in April 2013, which carried the purported announcement of Joel Osteen resigning from his post and renouncing Christianity.", "The statement released on Joel Osteen": "s website (https://www.joelostenministries.com), which appeared stripped down and bare, where he expressed his doubts about the faith and stated that he believes the Bible is fallible and flawed.", "The link provided in the blog entry": "which directed viewers to the supposed \"Official Site of Pastor Joel Osteen,\" where his resignation announcement was reproduced along with a news item from CNN headlined \"Pastor of mega church resigns, rejects Christ.\"", "The fact that the": "Official Site of Pastor Joel Osteen\" is a fake, as evidenced by the misspelling of his surname in the URL and the absence of any genuine news coverage or mention of this announcement on Joel Osteen's actual websites, Joel Osteen Ministries and Lakewood Church."}
