{"Lack of evidence": "The expert's verdict highlights that there is no evidence to support the claim that Hillary Clinton knew about the donations made to the campaign of an FBI official's wife. This lack of evidence undermines the authenticity of the claim.", "Source article": "The expert points out that the article from the Wall Street Journal, which first reported the story, does not mention anything about Clinton's knowledge of the donations or any connection between the donations and the FBI's decision regarding Clinton's emails. This suggests that the claim may not be accurate.", "Timing of oversight": "The expert mentions that the Wall Street Journal reported that the FBI official did not oversee the investigation of Clinton's emails until after his wife had already lost the election. This timeline contradicts the claim that the donations were made to influence the investigation, further questioning the authenticity of the claim.", "McAuliffe": "s response: In response to the Journal story, Democratic Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe stated that he supported Jill McCabe's campaign because she was the best candidate for the position. This statement implies that the donations may have been made based on McAuliffe's personal support for McCabe rather than any connection to Clinton or the FBI investigation."}
