{"Lack of a public pledge": "The expert highlights that there is no instance of anyone in the administration making a public pledge to keep unemployment below 8 percent. This suggests that the claim made by President Obama was not a direct promise but rather a projection.", "Source of the claim": "The expert identifies the source of the claim as a report titled \"The Job Impact of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan\" from Christina Romer and Jared Bernstein. This report projected that the stimulus plan would create 3 to 4 million jobs and predicted the unemployment rate with and without the stimulus.", "Projection vs": "promise: The expert emphasizes that the claim was based on projections and not a promise. The report itself included disclaimers stating that the estimates were subject to significant margins of error and uncertainty.", "Rating of the claim": "The expert mentions that the claim has been fact-checked multiple times and consistently rated as Mostly False. This suggests that the claim made by critics of the stimulus bill, including Mitt Romney, is not supported by the evidence and is misleading."}
