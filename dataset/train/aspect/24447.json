{"The claim made by Hillary Clinton is that": "1 percent of all the gun sellers are responsible for more than half of the guns that are used in crimes.\"", "The expert": "s verdict states that the claim is partially true, as the 2000 federal report from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) found that 1.2 percent of licensed gun dealers accounted for over 57 percent of the crime guns traced to current dealers in 1998.", "However": "the expert also highlights that tracing data on crime guns has significantly decreased since 2003 due to the Tiahrt Amendment, which restricts the ATF from sharing information with state and local police agencies unless it is related to a criminal investigation.", "Another aspect to consider is that Clinton": "s claim specifically refers to \"guns used in crimes,\" while the 2000 report mentioned \"crime guns,\" indicating a slight difference in terminology."}
