{"The claim that 43": "of all food stamp beneficiaries are undocumented immigrants has been circulating since at least 2012 on social media, chain emails, and memes.", "The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program": "SNAP), formerly known as the food stamp program, is not open to undocumented immigrants. Only U.S. citizens or eligible, lawfully-present non-citizens can qualify for SNAP benefits.", "Undocumented immigrants can only apply for SNAP benefits on behalf of their lawfully present children": "as stated by the Associated Press in June 2017.", "The Department of Agriculture": "which administers the SNAP program, has reported that even many non-citizens who are eligible for SNAP benefits do not apply due to the incorrect perception that it could affect their immigration status or chances of becoming a U.S. citizen."}
