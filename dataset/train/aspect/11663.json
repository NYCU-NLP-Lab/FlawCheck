{"Lack of substantial evidence": "The expert's verdict highlights that the claim lacked substantial evidence to support the assertion that Senator Kamala Harris is the aunt of actor Jussie Smollett. The most significant piece of evidence presented was the shared surname between Smollett's mother and Senator Harris, which is not sufficient to prove a familial relationship.", "Biographical information": "The expert analyzed the biographical information available for both Senator Harris and Jussie Smollett and found that their family branches do not intersect. Senator Harris has a younger sister named Maya, who is not Smollett's mother. The expert also mentioned that Smollett's mother's first name is Janet, not Maya, and she is from New Orleans, not Illinois.", "Lack of marriage connections": "The expert states that there is no discernible connection between Senator Harris' husband, Douglas Emhoff, or Maya Harris' husband, Tony West, with Jussie Smollett's parents. This suggests that there is no familial relationship through marriage that could support the claim that Senator Harris is Smollett's aunt.", "Geographic and historical inconsistencies": "The expert highlights geographic and historical inconsistencies that contradict the claim. Jussie Smollett was born in Santa Rosa, California, and grew up moving between New York and Los Angeles with his parents and siblings. On the other hand, Senator Harris was born in Oakland, California, and her family branches do not intersect with Smollett's. These inconsistencies further weaken the authenticity of the claim."}
