{"The claim is made by Hillary Rodham Clinton in a speech at Texas Southern University": "where she accuses former Gov. Rick Perry of signing a law that a federal court said was written with the purpose of discriminating against minority voters.", "Rick Perry responds to the claim": "calling it \"way outside the norm of ridiculous\" and suggesting that a federal judge could be found to say anything.", "The law in question is Senate Bill 14": "which requires Texas voters to present government-issued photo IDs at the ballot box, with gun licenses counting but student IDs not being accepted. Perry signed this law into effect on May 27, 2011.", "Federal Judge Nelva Gonzales Ramos strikes down the voter ID law in October 2013": "ruling that it creates a substantial burden on the fundamental right to vote, has a discriminatory effect and purpose, and constitutes a poll tax. She states that proponents of the law were motivated, at least in part, by its detrimental effects on the African-American and Hispanic electorate. However, the law remains temporarily in place for the 2014 midterm elections due to a stay granted by the Fifth Circuit of Appeals, which was backed by the Supreme Court. The case is still ongoing at the Fifth Circuit as of April 2015."}
