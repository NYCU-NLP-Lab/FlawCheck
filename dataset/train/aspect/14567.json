{"Lack of evidence": "The expert's verdict highlights that there is no evidence to support the claim that ISIS/Daesh created a WhatsApp group called \"Interschools\" where users cannot leave. The absence of any credible proof undermines the authenticity of the claim.", "Comparison with previous rumors": "The expert mentions that the \"Interschools\" warning closely resembles earlier rumors about various topics, such as Facebook implementing user fees or the existence of a premium messaging service called \"WhatsApp Gold.\" This comparison suggests that the claim may be just another baseless rumor.", "Logical inconsistencies": "The expert questions the logic behind the claim, pointing out that it doesn't make sense for a militant group like ISIS to entice random people into joining a WhatsApp group or prevent them from leaving. The lack of a clear motive or benefit for ISIS weakens the credibility of the claim.", "Official WhatsApp instructions": "The expert refers to the official WhatsApp FAQ, which provides simple instructions for exiting a group. By highlighting these instructions, the expert emphasizes that there is a straightforward process for leaving a WhatsApp group, contradicting the claim that users would be trapped in the \"Interschools\" group."}
