{"Lack of scientific evidence": "The expert's verdict highlights that there is no scientific evidence to support the claim that drinking cream of tartar mixed with orange juice can flush nicotine out of the body and help people quit smoking.", "Unreliable sources": "The article that promotes the claim lacks credible sources and instead cites dubious health websites and a clickbait mill known for fraudulent practices. This raises doubts about the reliability and accuracy of the information presented.", "Unsupported theories": "The claim relies on unsupported theories about detoxifying the body through diets or cleanses. The expert points out that detoxification diets and therapies have been suggested, but there is no compelling research to support their effectiveness.", "Warning from health authorities": "The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, an office of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, warns against unsafe and falsely advertised detoxification programs. They state that there is no compelling research to support the use of \"detox\" diets for weight loss or health promotion. This warning further undermines the credibility of the claim."}
