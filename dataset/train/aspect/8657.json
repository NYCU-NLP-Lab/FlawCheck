{"Lack of verifiable sources": "The expert mentions that no one has been able to identify a real pastor named Jeremiah Steepek or find any church headed by a pastor with that name. This lack of verifiable sources casts doubt on the authenticity of the claim.", "Inconsistency with known events": "The expert points out that while the specific story about Pastor Jeremiah Steepek may be fabricated, similar incidents did occur in 2013 with other pastors disguising themselves as homeless individuals. This inconsistency suggests that the claim may have been exaggerated or falsely attributed to a specific individual.", "Unrelated photograph": "The expert highlights that the accompanying photograph of \"Pastor Jeremiah Steepek\" is actually an unrelated image of an unidentified homeless man taken by a different photographer. This discrepancy further undermines the credibility of the claim.", "Lack of witnesses or evidence": "The expert mentions that no one has been able to verify the event described in the claim, despite it supposedly being witnessed by several thousand congregants. The absence of witnesses or concrete evidence raises doubts about the truthfulness of the claim."}
