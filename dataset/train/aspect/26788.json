{"Sinema": "s campaign website statement: Sinema's claim that she is \"the only candidate for Senate who refuses to cut Medicare and Social Security or raise the retirement age\" is supported by her own statement on her campaign website. She emphasizes her commitment to protecting these benefits for current seniors and future generations.", "Comparison with other candidates": "The expert's verdict mentions that Sinema is using her stance on Medicare and Social Security to differentiate herself from other candidates in the Arizona Senate race. This suggests that the authenticity of her claim can be verified by comparing her position with that of her Republican challengers, including Rep. Martha McSally, former Arizona state senator Kelli Ward, and Joe Arpaio.", "Voting record": "Sinema's campaign points to her and McSally's voting record on motions and concurrent resolutions related to Medicare and Social Security. While these votes may not directly stop or allow changes to these programs, they can provide insights into the candidates' positions and actions on the issue.", "Impact of nonbinding measures": "The expert's verdict mentions that Sinema's claim overplays the impact of some nonbinding measures voted on by her and McSally. These measures, such as a January 2017 concurrent resolution, may have created the possibility of changes to Medicare that could be interpreted as cuts. However, it is important to consider the limitations of these measures and their actual impact on Medicare, Social Security, and the retirement age."}
