{"The claim inaccurately states that Democratic senators sent a letter to the prosecutor in Ukraine in 2018 asking him to": "investigate Trump.\" The letter actually requested information on why Ukrainian special prosecutor Serhiy Horbatyuk had been prohibited from issuing subpoenas for evidence or interviewing witnesses in four existing investigations into former Trump Campaign Manager Paul Manafort.", "The letter did not concern a request to investigate Trump or the opening of any investigation related to him": "It specifically focused on the Manafort investigations, which involved money flowing either to Manafort or a law firm working with him to improve the image of former Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovich.", "The claim": "s association of the letter with the request made by President Trump to Ukrainian President Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden and his son is incorrect and misleading. The letter predates the events surrounding the Trump-Zelensky phone call and does not involve the same subject matter.", "The three Democratic senators who signed the letter": "Robert Menendez, Dick Durbin, and Patrick Leahy, were responding to a New York Times report that highlighted the blocking of the Manafort investigations from issuing subpoenas and interviewing witnesses. Their intention was to seek information and address concerns regarding these specific cases, not to request an investigation into Trump."}
