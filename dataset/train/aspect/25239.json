{"Reverse image search": "The expert conducted a reverse image search and traced the first image showing a policeman carrying a black box to the photo archives of the American news agency Associated Press. This verification method helped confirm that the photo was not recent and was actually from the 2016 elections in Uganda.", "Comparison with previous reports": "The expert found a similar image of uniformed men in a van in a 2016 report by the Voice of America about vote-rigging. This comparison helped establish that the second image was also from the 2016 elections and not a recent incident.", "Social media analysis": "The expert mentioned that numerous other posts with the same claim had popped up in various African countries, including Uganda, Ghana, Sierra Leone, Zambia, and Kenya. This analysis using the social media tool CrowdTangle helped determine that the claim was being widely circulated but did not provide evidence of its authenticity.", "Dismissal by opposition party": "The expert highlighted that Uganda's main opposition party, the Forum for Democratic Change (FDC), had dismissed the online posts as misleading. The FDC clarified in a tweet that the photos were from the previous 2016 election, emphasizing the importance of being factual and truthful in reporting news about the 2021 election. This dismissal by a credible political party added weight to the conclusion that the claim was not authentic."}
