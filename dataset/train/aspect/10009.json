{"Trump": "s statement: The expert's verdict highlights the claim made by President Donald Trump during his speech at the National Rifle Association convention, where he stated that his support among African-Americans had doubled in a week due to Kanye West's praise.", "Misrepresentation of poll results": "The expert's analysis reveals that Trump misstated the results of a Reuters weekly poll. While Trump claimed his approval rating among black men doubled from 11 percent to 22 percent, the actual poll showed an increase from 11 percent to 22 percent only among African-American men, not African-Americans in general.", "Small sample size": "The expert points out that the sample sizes of the polls in question were small, with one poll based on feedback from 118 respondents and the other from 171 respondents. This small sample size raises concerns about the reliability and accuracy of the results, as smaller samples are more prone to error.", "Limited credibility of the poll": "The expert mentions that Reuters' own polling editor stated that the sample sizes used in this particular poll were too small to reliably suggest any shift in public opinion. The \"credibility interval\" of the poll was +/- 9 percentage points, indicating a significant margin of error. Therefore, it is questionable to conclude, based on this poll, that Trump is experiencing a favorable shift in public opinion among black men."}
