{"The photograph is a genuine vintage image from the early 1900s": "but its origins and context were questioned by the expert.", "The backstory commonly attached to the photograph": "claiming it to be the unveiling of the first Harley-Davidson motorcycles in 1914, was deemed inaccurate and unsupported.", "The image was initially shared online by Ross Hollibaugh": "who believed it depicted his relatives posing at a Harley-Davidson dealership in Minnesota in 1914, rather than the founders of Harley-Davidson.", "The timeline and historical facts surrounding the claim were examined": "revealing that the first Harley-Davidson motorcycle was produced in 1903, and the first dealership opened a year later, making it unlikely for the photograph to capture the unveiling of their first motorcycle in 1914."}
