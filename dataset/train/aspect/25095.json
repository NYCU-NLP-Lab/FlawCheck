{"Research by TargetSmart": "The expert mentions that the claim about surging young-voter turnout is supported by research conducted by TargetSmart, a political data firm. They used official state election figures and analyzed the early turnout data through various demographic categories, including age.", "Increase in early voting": "According to TargetSmart's study, the number of Texans between the ages of 18 and 29 casting early ballots in the 2018 general election was about 5.7 times higher than the figure for the 2014 general election. This increase is close to the sixfold increase that equates to a 500% bump in early voting by young people.", "Youth turnout in Texas": "The expert mentions data from Tufts University's Center for Information & Research on Civic Learning and Engagement, which found that the rate of overall youth turnout in Texas, not just early voting, roughly tripled over 2014. This indicates a significant increase in youth participation in the 2018 election.", "Winning more votes than any Texas Democrat": "The expert confirms that the claim about winning more votes than any Democrat in the history of the state of Texas is correct. However, it is noted that O'Rourke benefited from the state's fast-growing population and high levels of support in counties with a high proportion of young voters, especially Latino youth."}
