{"The claim stated that Obama received 100 percent of the votes in 21 districts in Wood County": "Ohio, where GOP inspectors were illegally removed. The expert's verdict confirmed that neither presidential candidate received 100 percent of the votes in any of the county's 97 precincts. This contradicts the claim and verifies the inaccuracy of the statement.", "The claim mentioned that there were 106": "258 registered voters in Wood County, Ohio, out of an eligible 98,213. The expert's verdict revealed that according to the election board's data from 2012, there were actually 108,014 registered voters in the county. This indicates that the claim's number was incorrect and further undermines its authenticity.", "The claim alleged that Obama won by 108 percent of the total number of eligible voters in one Ohio county": "The expert's verdict did not provide a direct refutation of this specific claim, but it highlighted the presence of ghost registrations due to the large population of college students at Bowling Green. This suggests that the claim's reference to \"one Ohio county\" may be misleading or exaggerated.", "The claim suggested that GOP inspectors were removed during Election Day in Wood County": "Ohio. The expert's verdict included a statement from Terry Burton, director of the elections board in Wood County, denying this allegation. Burton confirmed that no precinct officials were removed during Election Day and no issues were identified during a recount. This contradicts the claim and supports the authenticity of the election process in Wood County."}
