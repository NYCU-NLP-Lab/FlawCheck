{"The claim originated from a satirical website called The Duffel Blog": "which is known for publishing fictional content. The website clearly states that it is a parody news organization and that its content should not be regarded as truthful.", "The accompanying photograph used in the article was doctored and not a real image": "The original photograph, published in 2015, showed floodwaters approaching downtown Houston but did not include a Navy ship.", "The USS Mustin": "the ship featured in the doctored image, was not deployed in the Gulf of Mexico during Hurricane Harvey. It was stationed over 6,000 miles away off the coast of Yokosuka, Japan in August 2017, as confirmed by a news article from the Hanford Sentinel.", "The presence of a former writer for Snopes": "Dan Evon, in the list of authors or contributors to the article does not provide any evidence of the claim's authenticity. The mention of Snopes as a registered service mark does not validate the claim either."}
