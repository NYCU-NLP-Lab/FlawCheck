{"Historical evidence": "The expert points out that throughout history, presidents have never been immune to criticism, regardless of the state of the economy. They highlight that every president, from Washington to Trump, has faced serious criticism from domestic adversaries and various groups.", "Lack of evidence": "The expert mentions that Trump's statement lacks evidence to support his claim. They state that for a quick analysis, they looked at two statistics - the unemployment rate and the president's approval rating - for every post-World War II president. They found four presidents (Truman, Johnson, Nixon, and Bush) who had similar low unemployment rates as Trump but had varying approval percentages.", "First Amendment protection": "The expert notes that criticism of government leaders is virtually inevitable due to the First Amendment, which protects freedom of speech, press, and the right to assemble and petition the government for grievances. This suggests that presidents have never been immune to criticism, regardless of the economic situation.", "Personal anecdotes and tweets": "The expert includes Trump's own tweets and statements as evidence against his claim. They cite a tweet where Trump complains about not getting enough credit for presiding over a strong economy and another tweet where he mentions being immune from criticism in the \"old days.\" These tweets are presented as contradictory and lacking substantial evidence."}
