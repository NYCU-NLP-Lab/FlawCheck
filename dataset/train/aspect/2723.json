{"The claim was made by Bernie Sanders during a speech in Keene": "New Hampshire, where he stated that the CEO of Goldman Sachs said Congress would \"have to cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid and give huge tax breaks to the wealthy and the large corporations.\"", "The Sanders campaign provided supporting documentation in the form of articles about Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein": "s efforts in 2012 to push Congress and President Obama toward a deal averting the fiscal cliff.", "The articles mentioned that Blankfein": "along with other corporate leaders, was part of a group called Fix the Debt, which held private meetings with legislators and the president in November 2012.", "While the timing of Sanders": "claim was off, as Blankfein's lobbying efforts occurred more than three years ago, the aim of Fix the Debt in 2012 was to encourage lawmakers to restrain entitlement spending and change the tax code to bring in more revenue. Some members of the group also advocated for cutting corporate tax rates."}
