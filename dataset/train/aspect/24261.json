{"The claim is based on the recently signed abortion restriction law in Georgia": "which prohibits the procedure once a fetal heartbeat can be detected, usually around the six-week mark.", "The claim is supported by the fact that several other states": "including Ohio, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Dakota, and Iowa, have similar laws in place or have attempted to pass them.", "The claim is further validated by the expectation that reproductive rights activists will challenge the Georgia law": "as many legal experts believe it violates the Supreme Court's abortion standard established in the Roe v. Wade decision.", "While it is difficult to determine exactly when": "most women\" know they are pregnant, experts agree that women who are not actively trying to conceive are less likely to be aware of their pregnancy until well after six weeks, making Swalwell's statement about the law banning abortion before most women know they're pregnant more accurate for unintended pregnancies."}
