{"The claim is based on an interview with Jonathan Saenz": "the president of Texas Values, who stated that legislation supported by gay rights activists would remove the terms \"mother\" and \"father\" from future Texas birth certificates.", "The expert contacted Chuck Smith": "the executive director of Equality Texas, who stated that Saenz's claim is incorrect because the legislation only applies to birth certificates issued in adoption cases, not all birth certificates.", "The expert also reached out to Rep": "Rafael Anchia, the sponsor of the legislation, who confirmed that the bill only pertains to supplemental birth certificates issued in adoption cases and does not affect regular birth certificates.", "The expert obtained information from Christine Mann": "a spokesperson for the Texas Department of State Health Services, who confirmed that nearly 30,000 supplemental birth certificates were filed by the state in a specific time period, and both regular and supplemental birth certificates look the same once issued."}
