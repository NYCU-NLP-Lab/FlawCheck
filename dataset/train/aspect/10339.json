{"Comparison of claim with official sources": "The expert compared the claim made by Tampa Mayor Bob Buckhorn with the official study presented by an airport consultant in March. They found that the claim did not match up with the numbers in the study, indicating a discrepancy in the authenticity of the claim.", "Evaluation of cherry": "picked data: The expert discovered that Mayor Buckhorn cherry-picked certain figures to support his claim. They found that the $150 million economic impact cited by Buckhorn was only predicted for European or Asian flights, whereas the majority of the new routes sought were to Central and South America, which would have a lower economic value. This evaluation of cherry-picked data raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Comparison with similar economic impact studies": "The expert referred to the opinions of John Kasarda, an expert in aviation-driven economic development, who stated that the basic numbers cited in the claim ($150 million and 1,200 jobs) were consistent with economic impact studies of international routes by wide-body jets. This comparison with similar studies adds credibility to the claim.", "Examination of methodology and assumptions": "The expert also spoke with Christina Cassotis, the consultant who presented the study's findings, to understand the methodology and assumptions used in estimating the economic impact. This examination revealed that specific aircraft types, fuel prices, and consumption rates were considered in the study. By evaluating these factors, the expert could assess the reliability of the claim's methodology and assumptions."}
