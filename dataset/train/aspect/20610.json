{"Presence of doctors at the protests": "The claim states that doctors wearing lab coats and carrying clipboards were present at the protests. This aspect was verified by the presence of men and women dressed as doctors in the protests, as reported by the Wisconsin Republican Party and confirmed by video evidence.", "Writing of sick notes": "The claim alleges that doctors were writing phony sick notes to excuse striking union members. This aspect was verified through statements made by individuals in the video, where one woman confirms that they were writing sick notes for anyone who needed them, including teachers and union members.", "Absence of formal strike declaration": "The claim suggests that the teachers' absences due to calling in sick amounted to a strike. However, it was verified that no formal strike declaration was made by state, local government, or public school employees affected by the proposed collective bargaining changes.", "Other evidence of doctors handing out notes": "In addition to the video evidence, other evidence was found indicating that doctors were indeed handing out notes to public workers. This includes the testimony of Dr. Kathleen Oriel, who admitted to issuing the notes and expressed concerns about potential trouble for doing so."}
