Simpson explicitly stated that he has always opposed driver's licenses for illegal aliens, contradicting Hughes' claim.", "Analysis of press releases": "The expert analyzed the press releases issued by both candidates. Hughes' press release stated that Simpson \"actually voted for driver's licenses for illegal immigrants,\" while Simpson's press release denied the claim. The expert took into account the conflicting statements made by the candidates.", "Consideration of context and speculation": "The expert considered the context of the 2011 vote and the reasons behind it. The vote was presented as a measure to bring Texas into compliance with the federal REAL ID Act, which required proof of legal residency for driver's license applicants. While Simpson voted in favor of this measure, it left room for speculation about his consistency on the issue. The expert took this into account while evaluating the authenticity of the claim."}
