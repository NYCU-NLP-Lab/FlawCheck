{"Biden": "s interview: In an interview with \"CBS Evening News,\" Joe Biden explicitly stated that he does not support defunding the police. He emphasized his support for conditioning federal aid to police based on certain standards and the need for police to protect the community. This interview further confirms Biden's stance on the issue.", "Trump": "s claims: President Donald Trump repeatedly claimed that Joe Biden wants to \"defund the police.\" However, there is no record of Biden taking that position at the time of Trump's claims, and Biden has since rejected the idea through a spokesman and in a TV interview. This demonstrates that Trump's claims are not supported by evidence."}
