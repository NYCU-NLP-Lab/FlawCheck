{"The expert refers to Senate Bill 193": "which proposes a universal Education Savings Account (ESA) bill in New Hampshire. This bill would allow parents to use 90 percent of the per-pupil grant given to local public schools for alternative educational expenses, such as private school tuition or homeschooling. This aspect of the claim is used to support the argument that increased competition improves public schools and enhances learning outcomes.", "The expert mentions the support of former Florida Gov": "Jeb Bush and his Foundation for Excellence in Education, which is backing market-based education reform efforts nationwide. This support is cited as evidence in favor of the claim that increased competition benefits public schools and leads to improved learning outcomes.", "A compilation of 30 policy briefs and academic studies by EdChoice": "a school choice advocacy group, is referenced. The studies cited by EdChoice generally found some positive impact on public schools facing competition from voucher programs or tax-credit scholarship programs. This aspect is used to support the claim that school choice, specifically through vouchers, can help public schools improve.", "However": "it is noted that most of the studies compiled by EdChoice only found modest positive relationships between test scores in public schools and competition from voucher programs or tax-credit scholarship programs. This aspect acknowledges that while there may be some positive impact, it is not necessarily revolutionary. The limited scope and eligibility of existing voucher programs are highlighted as potential factors that may restrict the extent of the positive effects on public schools."}
