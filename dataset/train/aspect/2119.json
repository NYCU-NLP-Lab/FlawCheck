{"Discrepancies in the photos": "The expert noted that in one photo, Jenner is shown holding a \"Black Lives Matter\" sign, while in another photo, her shadow does not include a sign, suggesting a poorly executed photo edit. This inconsistency raised doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Source of the edited photo": "The expert found that the edited image was shared on social media as a screenshot of a post from a now-deleted Facebook page named \"20K,\" which was dedicated to posting pictures of Kendall Jenner. The page's name and profile picture matched the screenshot, providing evidence that the edited photo originated from this specific source.", "Confirmation from Jenner": "Jenner herself took to Twitter to deny responsibility for the photo edit, stating that it was photoshopped by someone else. This statement from the person directly involved in the claim added credibility to the argument that the photo was doctored.", "Previous controversies and context": "The expert highlighted that Jenner had previously faced criticism for a Pepsi commercial that was accused of making light of the Black Lives Matter movement. This previous controversy, along with fans' expectations for her to speak up on the matter of George Floyd's death, provided a contextual backdrop for the claim and may have influenced people's perceptions of its authenticity."}
