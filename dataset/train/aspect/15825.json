{"The source of the claim": "The expert investigated the source of the claim, which was a bumper sticker in downtown D.C. The bumper sticker referenced the liberal Institute for Policy Studies and the non-profit group United for a Fair Economy, which have produced ratios of CEO pay to worker pay.", "Outdated information": "The expert discovered that the number on the bumper sticker (431 times) was out of date and referred to CEO pay in 2004. The expert then found more recent data from a September 1, 2010, annual compensation survey conducted by the Institute for Policy Studies (IPS), which showed the ratio had dropped to 263 times by 2009.", "Data collection methods": "The expert explained the data collection methods used by IPS to determine CEO pay and worker pay. CEO data was obtained from an Associated Press online survey for S&P 500 companies, which included various components of compensation. Worker pay data came from the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics, specifically the \"Average Hourly Earnings of Production and Nonsupervisory Employees\" category.", "Corroborating evidence": "The expert mentioned that other studies have also found a significant gap between executive and worker pay. They cited a Financial Times story from August 30, 2010, which reported that S&P 500 chief executives received median pay packages of $7.5 million, while official statistics showed the average worker pay to be significantly lower."}
