{"McDonald": "s denial: McDonald's has denied the claim made by Joe Biden that their employees are required to sign noncompete contracts preventing them from working at other fast-food restaurants like Burger King. This denial by the company itself is an important aspect in verifying the authenticity of the claim.", "Discontinued practice": "The expert's verdict mentions that McDonald's discontinued a related practice in 2017, which involved barring workers from moving from one store inside the company to another. This discontinuation of the practice suggests that the company no longer imposes restrictions on employees working for different branches within the company, further undermining the claim.", "No evidence to support the claim": "The expert's verdict states that there is no evidence to support Joe Biden's claim. This lack of evidence further weakens the credibility of the claim and adds to the verification process.", "No": "poach agreements: The expert's verdict highlights that while there have been instances of \"no-poach\" agreements in the fast-food industry, these agreements do not prevent workers from leaving for another company. This information contradicts the claim made by Joe Biden and provides additional evidence against its authenticity."}
