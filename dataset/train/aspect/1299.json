{"Disputed claims by ruling party and opposition": "The expert's verdict highlights that the ruling All Progressives Congress and the opposition often dispute the gains made in the quality of education in Nigeria's Ekiti State. This suggests that there is a lack of agreement on the authenticity of the claim.", "Lack of evidence and unproven claims": "The expert's verdict mentions that Governor Kayode Fayemi claimed that school enrolment rose to 96% under his previous leadership and fell to the \"least in the South West\" by 2018 under PDP rule. However, the verdict states that these claims are at best unproven and at worst entirely incorrect, indicating a lack of evidence to support the authenticity of the claim.", "Request for evidence and response": "The expert's verdict mentions that Africa Check reached out to Governor Fayemi's office and the state bureau of statistics to request evidence for the claim, but they are yet to respond. This suggests that the lack of response further raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Lack of data from reliable sources": "The expert's verdict highlights that the Nigeria Education Management Information System and the digest of education statistics, which are reliable sources for school enrolment data, do not have enough data for 2018. This indicates a lack of reliable data to verify the claim, further undermining its authenticity."}
