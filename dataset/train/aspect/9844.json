{"The claim was supported by a screenshot published by the page": "Women's Rights News\" which originated from a 15 January 2016 interview between YouTube personality Ingrid Nilsen and President Barack Obama. The comment about feminine hygiene products not being a luxury was made by Nilsen, not the President.", "The topic of feminine hygiene products being subject to sales tax was already popular on social media": "as evidenced by an article published on NYMag.com on 29 April 2016 exploring the tampon tax. The article mentioned various legislative actions and events related to the tampon tax, indicating a widespread interest in the issue.", "A widely circulated map created by Fusion in June 2015 illustrated the tampon tax in different states": "The map showed that most states taxed feminine hygiene products, with only a few having specific exemptions or no sales tax at all.", "The issue of the tampon tax gained significant national legislative momentum": "with bills being introduced in multiple states and the New York Senate unanimously passing the tampon tax bill in April. This legislative activity, along with the growing efforts to destigmatize menstruation and support women's rights, indicated a strong push to address the issue of taxing feminine hygiene products."}
