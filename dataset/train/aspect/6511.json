{"Analysis of tree": "ring records and ice-core samples: The researchers at the University of Geneva analyzed tree-ring records and ice-core samples to gather data on past climatic conditions and volcanic activity. This data was then compared to written historical accounts to verify the claim.", "Comparison with historical accounts": "The researchers compared their findings with written historical accounts dating back to the 12th century. They specifically looked for accounts of the lunar eclipse and any associated climatic changes to see if they aligned with the claim of volcanic eruptions causing the moon to vanish.", "Examination of the Peterborough Chronicle": "The Peterborough Chronicle, a historical document, described the 1110 lunar eclipse that completely blocked the moon. The expert examined this account to understand the nature of the event and determine if it could be explained by volcanic activity rather than a regular lunar eclipse.", "Consideration of atmospheric conditions": "The expert noted that the disappearance of the moon was described on an otherwise clear night sky, suggesting that cloud cover alone could not explain it. This aspect was crucial in ruling out alternative explanations and supporting the claim that volcanic aerosols might have blocked the moon."}
