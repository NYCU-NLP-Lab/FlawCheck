This would provide firsthand accounts and insights into Obama's presence and interactions during his time at the university.", "Analysis of yearbooks or other documentation": "The expert might have examined yearbooks or other documentation from Columbia University to search for any evidence of Obama's presence or involvement in campus activities.
