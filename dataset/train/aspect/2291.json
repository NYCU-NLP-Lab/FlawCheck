This aspect helps to establish the different religious contexts of the two regions.", "Incidence of school shootings": "The expert mentioned that Texas has a fatal school shooting every year, while Japan has never had a school shooting. This aspect highlights the contrasting rates of school shootings in the two regions and supports the claim that the school shooting rate is lower in non-Christian Japan.", "Gun death rate": "The expert mentioned that Japan has a gun death rate more than 500 times lower than that of the United States. This aspect provides additional evidence to support the claim by showing the overall lower prevalence of gun violence in Japan compared to a predominantly Christian region like Texas.", "Population statistics": "The expert referred to the Pew Research Center's data, stating that Christians likely make up less than two percent of the population in Japan. This aspect reinforces the argument that the lower Christian population in Japan could be a contributing factor to the lower school shooting rate."}
