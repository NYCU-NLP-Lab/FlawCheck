{"Donald Trump": "s own admission of evolving political beliefs: Trump himself has acknowledged that he has evolved politically over the years, stating that he has identified with some Democratic positions. This suggests that he has spent a significant amount of time as a Democrat in the last decade.", "Trump": "s party affiliation changes: According to the New York City Board of Elections, Trump has changed his party affiliation multiple times since registering as a Republican in 1987. This indicates that he has switched between being a Democrat and a Republican, further supporting the claim that he has been a Democrat for a significant portion of the last decade.", "Jeb Bush": "s accusation of Trump being a tax-hiking Democrat: Jeb Bush accused Trump of being a tax-hiking Democrat during a town hall meeting. While this statement alone may not be enough to verify the claim, it adds to the overall context and narrative that Trump has had a history of being aligned with Democratic policies.", "Calculation of the time period": "There is a discrepancy in the interpretation of the phrase \"the last decade.\" Bush's campaign claimed it referred to the years 2000 to 2010, during which Trump was registered as a Democrat for 8 years, 1 month. However, when considering the last 10 years from 2005 to the present, Trump has been registered as a Democrat for 3 years, 9 months, and as a Republican for 5 years, 6 months (and counting). This calculation provides additional evidence to support the claim."}
