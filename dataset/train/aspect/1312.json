{"The claim is a meme that quotes Rep": "Ilhan Omar as saying, \"I should not be expected to pledge allegiance to any country ... including America.\"", "There is no evidence that Omar ever said the quote attributed to her in the meme": "3. The quote in the meme is likely a modified version of a remark Omar made in relation to Israel, where she stated, \"I want to talk about the political influence in this country that says it is O.K. for people to push for allegiance to a foreign country.\"", "Omar clarified in a tweet that while she believes she should not have to pledge support to a foreign country": "she did not say the same about the United States, emphasizing her loyalty to her constituents in Minnesota."}
