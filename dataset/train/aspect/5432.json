Jim Doyle and a $14.8 million deposit at the end of Doyle's last budget, which occurred after Walker took office.

However, they note that this projection does not constitute an actual deposit and should not be considered as such.", "Official revenue estimates": "The expert points out that the numbers used to support the claim are not based on the \"official\" revenue estimates from the Legislative Fiscal Bureau, which is the neutral scorekeeper on budget items.
