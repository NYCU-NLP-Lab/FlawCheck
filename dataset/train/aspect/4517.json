{"The source of the claim": "The expert's verdict highlights that the claim originated from an article published on TDAlliance.com, which is an offshoot of the satirical Facebook group Fox News The FB Page. It emphasizes that neither of these sources has any affiliation with the legitimate Fox News cable channel.", "Content of the claim": "The claim suggests that the Obama administration issued a ban on sending Christmas cards to U.S. military members serving overseas because it offends Muslims. The expert's verdict quotes statements allegedly made by Pentagon spokesmen and the White House, which mention monitoring military mail for references to Christmas, Jesus Christ, or pork products.", "Lack of evidence and credibility": "The expert's verdict points out that the above-referenced article is a piece of fiction and that both TDAlliance.com and Fox News The FB Page have a history of publishing false rumors. It highlights examples of other false stories published by these sources, indicating a lack of credibility.", "Clarification of the actual situation": "The expert's verdict clarifies that the claim is false and that families can still send mail directly to their loved ones serving in the military. It also mentions the \"Holiday Mail for Heroes\" program and the ability to send holiday cards to U.S. military personnel through various Red Cross chapters, further debunking the claim."}
