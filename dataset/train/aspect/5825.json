{"The claim was verified by examining the legislative process and negotiations surrounding property tax relief": "It was found that the House and Senate settled on a solution of reducing the rate of property taxes and supplementing spending with more money from state coffers.", "The authenticity of the claim was verified by analyzing statements made by Senator Don Gaetz": "who stated that under President Andy Gardiner, $428 million worth of property tax relief was provided. This statement was confirmed to be true.", "The verification process involved understanding the complex relationship between education funding": "property taxes, and the required local effort. It was determined that the required local effort is paid for through a millage rate set by the Legislature, and local governments must assess that rate on property owners to contribute enough cash for schools and receive state funding.", "The verification process also took into account the economic factors affecting property tax collections": "It was noted that property values had increased, leading to higher tax collections even if the millage rate remained the same. The state's decision to use state tax money instead of increasing local property taxes was also considered."}
