{"Lack of evidence": "The expert's verdict states that there is no evidence to support the claim that a Democratic National Committee staffer was assassinated after providing WikiLeaks with thousands of DNC emails and attachments. This lack of evidence undermines the authenticity of the claim.", "Conspiracy theory": "The expert's verdict highlights that the claim is based on a conspiracy theory surrounding the murder of Seth Rich, who was shot to death in Washington, D.C. The use of a conspiracy theory as the basis for the claim raises doubts about its authenticity.", "Retraction of information": "The expert's verdict mentions that the initial report by Fox 5, which formed the basis of the claim, was later retracted. This retraction suggests that the information used to support the claim was not reliable, further questioning its authenticity.", "Contradictory statements": "The expert's verdict points out contradictory statements made by the private investigator, Rod Wheeler, who was hired to investigate Seth Rich's murder. Wheeler initially claimed to have evidence of communication between Rich and WikiLeaks but later backtracked on his statement. These contradictory statements cast doubt on the authenticity of the claim."}
