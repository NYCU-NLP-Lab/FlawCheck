{"Plagiarism": "The article claiming that Obama was arrested for espionage was found to be largely plagiarized from a news release by the Department of Justice regarding the arrest and charge of a former CIA officer. The article's author replaced the name of the charged spy with Obama's name and altered certain details.", "Lack of credible sources": "No other news outlet reported on the arrest of Obama, and none of his official social media accounts mentioned any such incident. This lack of corroboration from reputable sources casts doubt on the authenticity of the claim.", "Inclusion of satirical tweets": "The article included tweets as evidence, but one of them from a Guardian journalist was confirmed to be a joke mocking the implausible theory. Another tweet denying the Conservative Beaver as the source for the claim did not provide any additional evidence.", "Unreliable source": "The Conservative Beaver, the website that published the article, is a relatively new outlet run by a small team of volunteers in Canada. The lack of transparency and response to inquiries about the article further undermines its credibility."}
