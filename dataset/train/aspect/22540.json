{"The claim falsely states that all rhinoceroses have gone extinct": "while in reality, only the western black rhinoceros subspecies was declared extinct in 2011.", "The claim inaccurately reports a transfer of rhinos from one national park to an ecological reserve": "stating that both rhinos died, whereas the actual incident involved the transfer of 11 eastern black rhinos, all of which eventually died.", "The claim incorrectly attributes the cause of death to human interference": "specifically the transfer, whereas the deaths were actually caused by salt poisoning and an attack by lions.", "The claim mistakenly refers to the population of black rhinos being down to two": "when it is actually the northern white rhino that has only two remaining females."}
