{"U": "S. Rep. Hank Johnson's question: The expert's verdict mentions that U.S. Rep. Hank Johnson questioned Jeanne Monahan, an official with the socially conservative Family Research Council, about their alleged sponsorship of a prayer vigil to stop people from buying Girl Scout cookies. This questioning suggests that there is some evidence or claim regarding the prayer vigil.", "Left": "leaning websites and FRC's website: The expert's verdict states that the expert contacted Johnson's spokesman, who provided links to stories from left-leaning websites about the Family Research Council. Additionally, the spokesman sent a link to a posting on the FRC's website that displayed the text of an email sent out by the organization's Prayer Team. These sources provide additional information and context about the alleged prayer vigil.", "Email content": "The expert's verdict mentions the content of the email sent by the FRC's Prayer Team. The email asks readers to pray against the health care overhaul's contraception coverage requirements, the U.S. military's treatment of religion, and Planned Parenthood. It also mentions Girl Scout cookie sales and suggests a prayer to expose and defund Planned Parenthood. The content of the email supports the claim that the FRC had some involvement or concern regarding Girl Scout cookies and Planned Parenthood.", "Lack of denial": "The expert's verdict notes that Jeanne Monahan, when questioned about the prayer vigil, replied that she was not aware of any prayer vigil organized by her organization to stop people from buying Girl Scout cookies. While this doesn't directly confirm or deny the claim, it suggests that there may be some truth to the claim since Monahan did not outright deny it."}
