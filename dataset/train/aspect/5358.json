{"Historical minimum wage data": "The expert examined historical minimum wage data from the U.S. Department of Labor to determine the actual wage levels during the 1950s and 1960s. The data showed that the minimum wage increased six times during that period.", "Comparison to the poverty threshold": "The expert compared the minimum wage to the poverty threshold to assess whether it was high enough to lift individuals or families out of poverty. They mentioned that the federal poverty level was not developed until the early 1960s, but they used available data to estimate the poverty threshold for different family sizes during the 1950s and 1960s.", "Cost of living calculations": "To further evaluate the minimum wage's impact on poverty, the expert used a cost of living calculator from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. This allowed them to estimate the living costs during the 1950s and 1960s and determine if the minimum wage was sufficient to cover those expenses.", "Conclusion based on calculations": "Based on the historical minimum wage data, comparison to the poverty threshold, and cost of living calculations, the expert concluded that throughout the 1950s and 1960s, the minimum wage was high enough to keep individuals above the poverty level. They specifically mentioned that in 1956, the minimum wage reached a level where it was enough to push a two-person family above the poverty level."}
