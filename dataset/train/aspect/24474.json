{"Comparison of photos": "The expert would have examined the photos provided in the claim and compared them to known photographs of the Trump-Ukraine whistleblower, Chuck Schumer, Elizabeth Warren, Nancy Pelosi, and Hillary Clinton. This would involve analyzing facial features, body language, and any other identifying characteristics to determine if the individuals in the photos match the claimed identities.", "Background investigation": "The expert would have conducted a background investigation on the claim and the individuals involved. This could include researching their biographies, political affiliations, and past interactions to verify if it is plausible for them to be in the same photograph. Any discrepancies or inconsistencies found in the backgrounds of the individuals would cast doubt on the authenticity of the claim.", "Forensic analysis": "The expert may have employed forensic analysis techniques to examine the photographs for signs of tampering or manipulation. This could involve analyzing the digital metadata of the photos, such as timestamps and location data, to determine if they have been altered or if they were taken at the claimed time and place. Additionally, the expert may have examined the quality and resolution of the photos to identify any signs of editing or manipulation.", "Corroboration of witnesses": "The expert would have sought out any potential witnesses or individuals who may have knowledge of the claimed event or the authenticity of the photos. This could involve interviewing people who were present at the alleged event, reviewing any public statements or testimonies from individuals involved, or reaching out to individuals who may have had access to the original photos. If multiple witnesses can corroborate the claim or provide additional evidence supporting the authenticity of the photos, it would strengthen the case for their veracity."}
