{"Lack of attribution": "The claim lacks any attribution as to where or exactly when it was said by Kurt Cobain. This raises doubts about the authenticity of the quote.", "Inconsistency in performance": "The quote is often shared with a black-and-white photo of Cobain during Nirvana's MTV Unplugged performance in 1993. However, there is no evidence or record of Cobain speaking the quoted words during that performance.", "Origin of the hoax": "The claim originated on a Facebook page called Trump Train, which suggests a potential political motive behind spreading the quote. This raises suspicions about the credibility of the claim.", "Testimonies from experts": "Danny Goldberg, one of Nirvana's managers during Cobain's lifetime, debunked the quote and stated that it is a fabrication and a distortion of Cobain's beliefs. This expert testimony further undermines the authenticity of the claim."}
