{"Pocan": "s statement that \"73 percent of new jobs (in Wisconsin) have come from Madison\" was challenged by spokesperson David Kolovson, who clarified that Pocan actually meant to say that Dane County was responsible for 73% of jobs, not just Madison. This raises questions about the accuracy of Pocan's claim and whether he had accurate information on job growth in the state.", "The U": "S. Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that Madison added a net of 13,000 jobs from 2006-2016, while the state as a whole added 87,000 jobs during the same period. This contradicts Pocan's assertion that Madison was responsible for 73% of job growth in the state, suggesting that the actual contribution of Madison to job growth is significantly lower.", "Bureau of Labor Statistics Economist Steve Hipple suggests that the best measure of job growth is the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages": "which is based on state unemployment insurance filings and produces county and state-level employment figures. This dataset may provide a more accurate picture of job growth in Madison and its contribution to the overall job growth in Wisconsin.", "The available employment data": "up until the second quarter of 2016, shows that Dane County is responsible for 58% of the state's job growth. This figure is significantly lower than Pocan's claim of 73% and further undermines the authenticity of his statement."}
