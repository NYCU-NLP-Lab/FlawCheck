{"Independent analysis from the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities": "The expert mentions that the claim was supported by an independent analysis conducted by the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank. This analysis estimated that the president's combination of spending cuts and tax increases would lower deficits by $3.8 trillion over a 10-year period.", "Breakdown of deficit reduction sources": "The expert mentions that according to the center's analysis, approximately 46 percent of the deficit reduction would come from higher revenues, while about 54 percent would come from spending cuts. This breakdown provides a clear understanding of how the claimed deficit reduction would be achieved.", "Detailed and complex plan": "The expert highlights that the president's plan is detailed and complex, mentioning specific measures such as repealing the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method of accounting for inventories, determining the foreign tax credit on a pooling basis, repealing the lower-of-cost-or-market inventory accounting method, and eliminating special treatment of carried interest. This level of detail suggests that the claim is based on a comprehensive and well-thought-out plan.", "Agreement between the president and Congress in 2011": "The expert mentions that the $3.8 trillion deficit reduction estimate includes $1.7 trillion in reductions that the president and Congress agreed to in 2011. This indicates that there is a precedent for bipartisan agreement on deficit reduction measures, adding credibility to the claim."}
