{"The expert": "s verdict highlights that U.S. Rep. Lamar Smith, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) have been involved in frequent debates and discussions regarding environmental policies, including the EPA's Clean Power Plan.", "The expert mentions that Rep": "Lamar Smith claimed that the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) estimated that the Obama administration's Power Plan would cause energy costs in Texas to rise by as much as 16 percent per year. However, the expert points out that the ERCOT report actually states that the increase in energy costs will occur over a longer period of time, specifically by 2030, rather than annually.", "The expert refers to the ERCOT report and accompanying news release": "which states that the estimated increase in energy costs by 2030 is solely due to the Clean Power Plan (CPP) and does not account for other associated costs such as transmission upgrades, higher natural gas prices, procurement of additional ancillary services, and costs related to the retirement or decreased operation of coal-fired capacity in the ERCOT region.", "The expert also emphasizes the importance of understanding the timeline of the Clean Power Plan": "According to the EPA's Clean Power Plan Final Rule, states with fossil fuel-fired electric generating units are required to create plans setting emissions standards for those units. The deadline for submitting these plans is in 2016, with a possible extension to 2018. This information is relevant in evaluating the claim's accuracy and the potential impact on energy costs in Texas."}
