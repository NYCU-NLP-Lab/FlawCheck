{"The claim is supported by a statement from Oregon": "s junior U.S. senator, Jeff Merkley, who wrote in a guest column about the debt burden faced by Oregon's university graduates. This provides a direct source for the claim.", "The": "24,000 figure is backed by a fact sheet from the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning think tank, which states that the average debt per borrower in Oregon is $24,370. This adds credibility to the claim as it is based on data from a reputable organization.", "The statistic is also supported by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York": "s Household Debt and Credit Report, which includes student loan data. The report confirms that the average amount borrowed by Oregon students is slightly lower than the national average, but still significant.", "The Institute for College Affordability": "Success, a nonprofit organization that tracks student debt, provides further evidence by stating that graduates from Oregon colleges in 2011 incurred an average debt of $25,497. This supports the claim by showing that the average debt upon college graduation in Oregon is indeed above $24,000."}
