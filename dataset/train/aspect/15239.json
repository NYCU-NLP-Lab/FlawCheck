{"The claim was based on an article within a Facebook post that reported Nigeria": "s failure to be shortlisted by the World Health Organisation-led COVAX global initiative for the global Pfizer vaccines due to the country's inability to store the vaccines at the required -70 degrees Celsius.", "The claim was repeated in an almost identical version of the article by popular online newspaper Sahara Reporters": "which stated that Nigeria and eight other countries were disqualified from the \"global vaccine bid\" known as COVAX.", "Both reports relied on a statement delivered by WHO Africa regional director Matshidiso Moeti": "who mentioned that Nigeria had failed to make the cut for the first consignment of Pfizer vaccines but did not state that Nigeria had been disqualified from receiving COVAX-supplied vaccines.", "The WHO Nigeria representative": "Walter Kazadi-Mulombo, clarified that the agency had no power to disqualify a member state, further debunking the false claims."}
