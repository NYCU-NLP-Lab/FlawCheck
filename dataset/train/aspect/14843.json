{"The claim is based on a 2012 finding of an Italian court that linked a child diagnosed with autism to the MMR vaccine the child received a year earlier": "However, it is important to note that this finding relied heavily on the discredited and retracted 1998 Wakefield MMR Lancet paper, which was fraudulent and scientifically flawed.", "The court also heard the testimony of Dr": "Massimo Montinari, who was hired by the child's parents and known to encourage parents to avoid vaccinating their children. Montinari has also written a book on how vaccines cause autism and promoted an alleged autism \"cure\" that lacked scientific evidence. In 2017, he was reportedly suspended for six months due to the lack of scientific evidence for his method.", "The claim further suggests that vaccine": "courts\" in the United States are paying off families to buy their silence regarding adverse side effects. However, these \"courts\" refer to the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP), which was established in 1988 to evaluate vaccine injury claims. It is not a secretive or corrupt entity but a mechanism to address vaccine-related injury claims.", "Multiple subsequent studies conducted by scientists have not been able to establish any association between the MMR vaccine and autism": "These studies contradict the claim and provide a strong scientific consensus that the MMR vaccine is safe and does not cause autism."}
