{"The claim originated from a blog post on The Point News": "a British website run by volunteers, which stated that a campaign official for President-elect Joe Biden was arrested for electoral fraud.", "The post cited the National File": "which published affidavits filed as part of a lawsuit claiming to have evidence of an illegal ballot harvesting operation run by Dallas Jones, the \"Democrat director of Texas state political strategy\" for Biden\u2019s campaign.", "Fact": "checkers found no evidence to support the claim. They checked Harris County court records and found no charges or arrests related to electoral fraud against Jones.", "The Biden campaign issued a statement calling the claims": "laughably false,\" and Jones himself denied the allegations, stating that they were completely fabricated."}
