{"The claim states that U": "S. Rep. Mimi Walters \"took $213,000 from insurance interests.\" The expert's verdict found that the claim is slightly misleading as it overstates the amount of insurance donations Walters has received.", "The claim also states that Walters supported a health care plan that": "strips protections for people with pre-existing conditions and slaps an age tax on older Californians.\" The expert's verdict confirms that Walters did vote to repeal President Barack Obama's health care law, known as Obamacare, and replace it with the American Health Care Act (AHCA), which would have allowed insurers to charge higher rates for pre-existing conditions.", "The expert": "s verdict clarifies that under Obamacare, insurers are prohibited from denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions and cannot charge higher rates for such conditions. However, the AHCA would have kept the requirement for insurers to offer health insurance to people with pre-existing conditions but would have allowed them to charge higher rates.", "It is mentioned that Walters voted with Trump 99 percent of the time": "but the expert's verdict does not specifically address this aspect of the claim."}
