{"The claim is based on the rankings of two specific high schools": "Ronald Reagan College Prep and Rufus King International, as mentioned in the 2014 U.S. News and World Report list of the nation's best high schools.", "The claim is supported by the fact that both Reagan and King held the second and third spots in the state of Wisconsin on the U": "S. News ranking, after Middleton High School.", "The authenticity of the claim is further verified by comparing the rankings from different sources": "such as Newsweek and the Washington Post. While Reagan and King were not mentioned on Newsweek's 2014 list, they were ranked third and tenth on the Washington Post's list of Wisconsin schools, respectively.", "The expert also highlights that U": "S. News' rating system is more comprehensive and thorough compared to other media-created \"best high schools\" lists. U.S. News methodology aims to recognize schools that serve all students well, not just the college-bound, and produce measurable outcomes across the student body."}
