{"The": "1 billion-plus recovery in Virginia last year was an anomaly and accounted for more than half of the total $1.9 billion that the Medicaid Fraud Control Unit (MFCU) has recouped since its creation in 1982. This indicates that only fractions of the recovery were related to fraud in Virginia and returned to the state's coffers.", "The MFCU in Virginia has a national reputation for successfully investigating major national cases": "In a news release, the Virginia attorney general's office mentioned that whistleblowers approached Virginia because of the unit's track record in investigating such cases. This suggests that the MFCU's credibility and expertise were employed to verify the authenticity of the claim.", "The settlement of a major case involving Abbott": "a pharmaceutical company, further supports the credibility of the MFCU. The Virginia attorney general's office stated that although neither the whistleblowers nor the defendant in the case were located in Virginia, the whistleblowers approached the MFCU because of its national reputation for successfully investigating major national cases. This indicates that the MFCU's involvement in significant fraud cases adds to its credibility in verifying the authenticity of the claim."}
