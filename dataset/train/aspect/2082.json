{"The photograph purportedly showing Margaret Sanger at a Klan rally is not genuine": "as it was doctored and originally featured a lit cross that was edited out and replaced with a picture of Sanger.", "The original context of the photograph": "which was a fabricated blog post, was largely erased from the internet, leading to confusion about its authenticity.", "Despite the fabricated image": "there is some distorted truth in the assertion that Sanger once addressed female KKK members in Silver Lake, New Jersey.", "While Sanger did support the eugenics movement": "there is no evidence to support the claim that she was an active participant in the Ku Klux Klan."}
