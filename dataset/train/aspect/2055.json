{"Contradictory description": "The expert's verdict highlights that the story begins with a different description, contradicting itself from the outset. This inconsistency raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Denial from Fiji Corrections Centre": "The spokesperson for the Fiji Corrections Centre in Suva confirmed that no such escape had taken place. This official denial adds weight to the suspicion that the claim is not authentic.", "Similarities to unrelated prison break": "The expert's verdict mentions that some aspects of the story appear to be lifted from an October 2016 Reuters report about a prison break in Haiti, not Fiji. This similarity suggests that the claim may have been fabricated by borrowing details from a different incident.", "Lack of official condemnation": "The expert's verdict points out that Meganews360.com claimed the Fijian government \"condemned\" the incident via tweet, but no such condemnation actually occurred. This discrepancy further undermines the credibility of the claim."}
