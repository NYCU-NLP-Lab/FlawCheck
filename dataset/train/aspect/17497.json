{"The use of a spoon to scrape the back of the tongue": "The claim involves using a spoon to scrape the back of the tongue, which is a method described in a 1996 review paper in the Journal of the American Dental Association. This method is believed to provide a rough sense of a person's own breath odor, which is normally not readily perceptible to the person creating the odor.", "Sealing the spoon in a plastic bag": "After scraping the tongue with a spoon, the claim suggests sealing the spoon in a plastic bag. This step is mentioned in the expert's verdict as a way to preserve the sample for further analysis.", "Placing the bagged spoon under a bright light for one minute": "The claim states that the bagged spoon should be placed under a bright light for a specific duration of time. This step is mentioned by the expert as a way to increase the odor causing potential of the material sampled by the spoon.", "Smelling the spoon to assess the odor": "After the spoon has been scraped, sealed, and placed under a light, the claim suggests smelling the spoon to assess the odor. According to the expert's verdict, a healthy tongue coating should be clear, but if the material on the spoon is thick, colored, or has an unpleasant odor, it could be an early sign of problems with the respiratory system, liver, kidneys, hormones, or gut. Different smells could indicate different health problems, such as diabetes or kidney problems."}
