{"The claim states that gay men incarcerated in Nazi concentration camps were forced back into prison even after the Allied forces won World War II": "This claim is supported by the Facebook post on the Lizzy The Lezzy page, which brought attention to the treatment of LGBTQ Germans during and after the war.", "The post includes a picture of a pink triangle": "which was the symbol used by Nazi officials to identify and ostracize gay concentration camp prisoners. This symbol confirms the existence of gay men being targeted and imprisoned during the Nazi regime.", "The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum verifies the accuracy of the claim": "They state that an estimated 100,000 men were arrested for violating Nazi Germany's law against homosexuality, with approximately 5,000 to 15,000 of them being sent to concentration camps. After the war, most prisoners were released except those who wore the pink triangle, who were put back in prison.", "The museum also confirms that although the Allies defeated the Nazi regime": "the law against homosexuality remained in effect after World War II. The revised version of Paragraph 175, which criminalized homosexuality, was not repealed until 1994, and some homosexuals were forced to serve out their terms of imprisonment even after being liberated from the concentration camps."}
