{"The use of two sets of data": "The expert's investigation revealed that the White House used two sets of data to formulate the claim. This included new home sales data measured by the Census Bureau and the U.S. Department of Commerce, as well as existing home sales data compiled by the National Association of Realtors.", "Comparison of average data": "To verify the claim, the White House compared the average of the last six months of available data (ending November 2014) to the lowest point in sales for both new and existing homes. The low points were identified as February 2011 for new home sales and July 2010 for existing home sales.", "Consideration of single": "family homes and condos/co-ops: While the White House provided data for single-family home sales only, the expert also took into account the National Association of Realtors' suggestion to combine both single-family homes and condos/co-ops data for a better overall picture.", "Comparison to pre": "recession levels: The expert noted that the sales figures provided by the White House, even with the increase, were still approaching a return to more normal transaction numbers. This was highlighted by mentioning the peak sales during the housing bubble in 2005 before the market downturn in 2008."}
