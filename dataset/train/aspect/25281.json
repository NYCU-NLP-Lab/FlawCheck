{"Inaccurate number": "The expert found that the claim of Texas gaining 21,000 doctors due to tort reform was incorrect. The accurate increase in the number of doctors between 2003 and 2011 was 12,788, which is significantly lower than the claim made by Governor Rick Perry.", "Source of data": "The expert examined the data used by Governor Perry to support his claim, which was provided by the Texas Medical Association. However, it was noted that not everyone with a medical license issued in Texas actually practices in the state. The Texas Medical Board, which tracks the doctors who work in the state, reported a lower number of doctors than claimed by Governor Perry.", "Population growth": "The expert found that the primary driver behind the increase in the number of doctors in Texas was population growth. Between 2002 and 2010, the population of Texas grew by 20 percent, while the number of doctors increased by 24 percent. This indicates that the increase in doctors can be attributed to the growing population rather than tort reform.", "Analysis filtering out population effect": "The expert considered an analysis conducted by Jon Opelt, the executive director of Texas Alliance for Patient Access, a group supporting tort reform. Opelt's analysis attempted to filter out the population effect and suggested that the higher rate of doctors could be attributed to tort reform. However, the expert did not find this analysis convincing enough to support the claim of tort reform being the main factor behind the increase in doctors."}
