{"The claim is based on Republican state Sen": "Jeff Wentworth's 2003 proposal, which was passed into law, giving students a regular opportunity to pray and requiring them to recite the U.S. pledge of allegiance and the pledge to the Texas flag.", "The law requires students to recite the U": "S. and Texas pledges of allegiance once each school day, followed by a one-minute moment of silence in which students can choose to reflect, pray, meditate, or engage in any other silent activity.", "School employees are responsible for ensuring that students remain silent during the moment of silence and do not interfere with or distract other students": "4. The measure authored by Wentworth resulted in the restoration of daily minutes of silence, permitting prayer, and the recitation of the pledges in schools."}
