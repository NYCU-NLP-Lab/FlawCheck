{"The discrepancy between Scott Pruitt": "s claim of adding almost 50,000 jobs in the coal sector and the actual increase in coal jobs since the end of last year, which was only 1,300 according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data.", "The BLS data shows that the monthly increase in coal jobs in May was only 400": "significantly lower than the 7,000 jobs cited by Pruitt.", "Pruitt": "s claim seems to include not only coal mining jobs but also jobs in the broader \"mining and logging\" sector. However, even by that standard, the increase in the mining and logging sector since the end of last year was 38,000 jobs, far below the claimed 50,000 jobs.", "The American Coal Council suggests that the BLS": "definition of coal-sector jobs may be narrower than the definitions used by states, leading to discrepancies in the reported employment numbers."}
