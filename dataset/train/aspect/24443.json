{"The lack of public record": "The expert's verdict states that there is no public record of Boris Johnson or Mike Pompeo making the comments attributed to them. This suggests that the authenticity of the claim is questionable as there is no evidence to support it.", "Rejection by official sources": "Dean Hurlock, head of communications at the British High Commission in Nigeria, rejected the claim as false. He stated that the UK Prime Minister did not make any of the comments attributed to him and emphasized the UK's respect for Nigeria's territorial integrity. Similarly, a public information officer at the US consulate in Nigeria also stated that the attribution to Secretary Pompeo is false. The rejection of the claim by these official sources adds to the verification process.", "False attribution to other global figures": "The expert's verdict mentions that numerous Facebook pages in support of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) have falsely attributed comments in support of an independent Biafra to various global figures like Bill Gates, Donald Trump, Antonio Guterres, and Emmanuel Macron. This pattern of false attribution raises doubts about the authenticity of the specific claim regarding Boris Johnson and Mike Pompeo.", "Copyright statement": "The expert's verdict ends with a copyright statement from AFP, indicating that the content of the article is protected and cannot be reproduced or distributed without a specific license agreement. While this aspect may not directly verify the authenticity of the claim, it highlights the credibility and reliability of the source providing the verdict."}
