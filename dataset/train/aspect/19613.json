{"The claim made by the Georgia Democratic Party that": "Georgia Republicans have mismanaged unemployment benefits\" was brought to the attention of the fact-checkers by disgruntled Democratic politicos and party officials.", "The claim was countered by Andre Walker on his website": "Georgia Unfiltered, who pointed out that the Georgia Labor Commissioner in charge of unemployment benefits, Michael Thurmond, is a Democrat. Walker also questioned where the mismanagement was, highlighting the funding allocated by the Republican-led state Legislature for unemployment benefits.", "The state Labor Department clarified that the Legislature does not allocate funding for unemployment benefits": "and instead, the funds come from taxes paid by Georgia employers. This information helps verify the claim by providing insight into the source of the funds and the role of the Legislature.", "The Georgia unemployment program is funded by businesses in the state who contribute to a state fund": "which the Labor Department uses to pay unemployment benefits. The fund had a balance of $1.9 billion in 1998, but during the Great Recession in 2009, Georgia paid $1.47 billion in unemployment benefits. This context helps understand the financial strain on the unemployment program and the challenges faced by the state during periods of high unemployment."}
