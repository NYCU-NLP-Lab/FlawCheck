{"Congressman Joaquin Castro": "s statement: The expert's verdict includes the claim made by Democratic Congressman Joaquin Castro during a news conference, where he stated that most people in Texas disagree with the president building a wall across the border. This statement serves as the basis for the authenticity verification process.", "Reference to a poll by Quinnipiac University": "Castro's spokeswoman, Jamie Geller, mentioned a poll conducted by Quinnipiac University in April 2018. The poll reported that 53 percent of respondents surveyed opposed the construction of a wall. This poll is cited as evidence supporting Castro's claim.", "Evaluation of multiple polls": "The expert's verdict mentions that three non-partisan entities, namely the University of Texas/Texas Tribune polls, Texas Lyceum polls, and Quinnipiac University polls, have conducted surveys on the subject since 2016. The verdict states that four out of the five polls showed more respondents opposing the wall than supporting it, with one poll showing an even split. This evaluation of multiple polls helps in assessing the validity of Castro's claim.", "University of Texas": "Texas Tribune poll results: The expert's verdict specifically refers to a University of Texas/Texas Tribune poll conducted in June 2016. This poll showed that 52 percent of respondents either strongly supported or somewhat supported a border wall, while 40 percent either strongly opposed or somewhat opposed it. The inclusion of this poll result adds another aspect to the verification process."}
