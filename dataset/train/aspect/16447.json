{"The claim is based on a scene from the James Bond film Goldfinger": "where the character Jill Masterson is portrayed as dying from asphyxiation after being covered with gold paint.", "The expert": "s verdict highlights the misconception at the time that closing off all the pores in one's body would result in a quick death. It explains that as long as a person can breathe through their mouth and/or nose, they will not die of asphyxiation, regardless of how much of their body is covered with paint or any other substance.", "To verify the authenticity of the claim": "the expert mentions that during the filming of the \"gold corpse\" scene, the studio had doctors present to ensure that the actress, Shirley Eaton, was not overcome by the effects of the paint. This suggests that precautions were taken to ensure the safety of the actor during the filming.", "The expert also mentions that Shirley Eaton did not suffer any ill effects from being covered in paint for the film": "She continued to act in several more films before retiring, indicating that the claim of her death from asphyxiation due to the gold paint is false."}
