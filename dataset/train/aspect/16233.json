{"The monthly average carbon dioxide in the atmosphere exceeded 400 parts per million for the first time in March": "according to a report from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). This report provided evidence to support the claim.", "The NOAA has been compiling data on carbon dioxide levels since 1979 and has never recorded a monthly global average exceeding 400 parts per million until May 6": "when they announced the milestone. This fact reinforces the authenticity of the claim.", "While the NOAA": "s monthly global average had not previously exceeded 400 parts per million, there have been instances of single locations, such as Barrow, Alaska, and Mauna Loa, Hawaii, recording monthly average carbon dioxide levels exceeding 400 parts per million. This information highlights the importance of specifying whether the claim refers to a global or single location average.", "Ice": "core data from Antarctica, which was referred to by Senator Whitehouse's spokesman, can provide additional evidence to support the claim about carbon dioxide levels in human history. However, further information about the specific findings from the ice-core data is needed to fully verify this aspect of the claim."}
