{"The claim states that in the early 1960s": "all levels of government were consuming about 27 percent of the U.S. economy, a number that has risen to 37 percent today. The first aspect employed to verify the authenticity of this claim is the comparison of government expenditures as a percentage of GDP between fiscal years 1961-1963 and fiscal years 2009-2010. The statistics provided by the Office of Management and Budget confirm that government expenditures did increase from 27.4 percent in 1961 to 36.5 percent in 2009.", "The second aspect involves a more detailed analysis of the components of government spending that expanded and contracted between 1963 and 2010": "It is found that defense spending and \"other spending\" decreased as a percentage of GDP, while state and local government increased by about one-fifth. However, the big increases came from Social Security and Medicare, which more than tripled as a share of GDP, and other federal payments to individuals.", "The third aspect highlights the significance of transfer payments": "such as Social Security and Medicare, in the overall increase in government expenditures. These transfer payments are payments made by the government to individuals and can be more or less freely spent by private individuals. The inclusion of Medicare in 1965 contributed to a significant portion of the increase in government expenditures.", "The fourth aspect emphasizes the question of control in relation to transfer payments": "Private individuals have the freedom to spend these payments as they choose, which can impact the economy and the concept of a free economy. This aspect is supported by the insight of economist Gary Burtless from the Brookings Institution."}
