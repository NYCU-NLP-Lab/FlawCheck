{"The claim is supported by the statement of Agriculture Commissioner Todd Staples": "who states that Americans spend less than 10 percent of their disposable income on food. This statement is considered an authoritative source.", "The claim is further verified by a table created by the USDA": "s Economic Research Service, which outlines the proportion of an individual's disposable personal income spent on food from 1929 through 2009. This data shows that the percentage of disposable income spent by Americans on food has consistently dropped over the decades.", "Ephraim Leibtag": "a USDA senior economist, confirms that as income and wealth rise in a country, the percentage of income spent on food decreases. This supports the claim that Americans spend less on food compared to other countries.", "The claim is compared to statistics from a July 2006 article on Salem": "News.com, which lists the percentage of disposable income spent on food at home in various countries. While these statistics focus only on food prepared at home, they still support the general trend that Americans spend a lower percentage of their income on food compared to countries like Mexico, China, and Russia."}
