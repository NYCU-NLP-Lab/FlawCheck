{"The claim that the candidate did not take": "corporate PAC money\" is contradicted by the Federal Election Commission (FEC) records, which show that the candidate received 99 \"discrete PAC contributions\" from 81 different PACs.", "The expert": "Andrew Mayersohn, points out that while the candidate did receive money from labor PACs and Democratic leadership PACs, it is unlikely that he would feel indebted to corporate PACs just because they contributed to other PACs that supported his campaign.", "Adam Bonin": "a political law compliance expert, highlights the difference between accepting money directly from corporate PACs and receiving funds from PACs that have received corporate contributions. This suggests that the candidate may have indirectly received corporate funds through certain PACs.", "Donations from PACs reliant on support from executives": "employees, and their relatives at large companies and conglomerates were made to the candidate's campaign, including contributions from Sen. Joe Kennedy III's 4MA leadership PAC, which has ties to companies like Goldman Sachs, Ford Motor Company, Home Depot, and pharmaceutical companies."}
