{"The claim originated from an entertainment website called Boston Leader": "which published an article about a zoo in China naming a baby gorilla Harambe McHarambeface.", "The Jinhua Zoo": "located in China's Zhejiang province, allegedly held an online naming contest for the baby gorilla, with \"Harambe McHarambeface\" winning over 93% of the votes.", "The Boston Leader article was found to be a hoax": "as there was no evidence of the Jinhua Zoo naming a baby gorilla Harambe McHarambeface. The Boston Leader website itself was also relatively new, starting just a day before the article was published.", "There was no record of any Jinhua Zoo official commenting on the naming of a baby gorilla as Harambe McHarambeface": "nor any mention of the alleged Chinese name \"Heijin\" associated with the gorilla."}
