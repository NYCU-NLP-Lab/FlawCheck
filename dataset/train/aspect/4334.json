{"Nancy Pelosi": "s statement: The expert's verdict mentions that Nancy Pelosi, the House Minority Leader, made a statement in a press conference where she claimed that more than 64 percent of minimum-wage earners are women. This statement serves as the initial claim that needed to be verified for authenticity.", "Source of the claim": "The expert's verdict mentions that the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) is the best source for verifying the claim. The BLS compiles data from the U.S. Census Bureau's Current Population Survey, which provides information on the characteristics of minimum-wage workers. This source was used to verify the claim.", "Data from the BLS": "The expert's verdict states that the BLS figures from 2012, based on census data, support Pelosi's assertion. The BLS data showed that there were slightly over 3.5 million men and women earning minimum wage or less in 2012, with nearly 2.3 million women at those wage levels. Dividing the total by the number of women workers resulted in a percentage of 64.4 percent, confirming Pelosi's claim.", "Small percentage of minimum": "wage workers: The expert's verdict also highlights an additional aspect related to the claim, which is that people earning the minimum wage account for a very small percentage of people working. In this case, it was mentioned that 2.6 percent of working women earned the minimum wage. Although not directly related to verifying the authenticity of the claim, this aspect provides additional context and information about the overall situation of minimum-wage workers."}
