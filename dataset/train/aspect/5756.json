{"The claim is based on a report by the White House Council of Economic Advisers": "which states that the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act \"saved or created between 2.4 and 3.6 million jobs as of the first quarter of 2011.\" This report serves as the primary source for the claim.", "The claim uses a specific figure of": "278,000 per job, which is not mentioned in the White House report. The figure was calculated by dividing the total stimulus bill's outlays and tax cuts ($666 billion) by the low-end estimate of jobs saved or created (2.4 million). This calculation was made by the source cited in the claim.", "The claim is supported by the fact that multiple Republican organizations and politicians": "including House Speaker John Boehner and the National Republican Congressional Committee, used the same report and statistic to target Democrats, including Rush Holt, Frank Pallone, and Sherrod Brown. This suggests a coordinated effort to promote the claim.", "The expert": "s verdict highlights the lack of evidence in the White House report to support the specific figure of $278,000 per job. The expert also emphasizes the political agenda behind the claim, as it was used by Republicans to criticize Democratic politicians and the stimulus package."}
