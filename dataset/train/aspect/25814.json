{"Dewhurst": "s role in writing the state budget: The expert notes that Dewhurst, as the lieutenant governor, does not have a specified role in writing each state budget. While he appoints members of the Senate Finance Committee and negotiates budgetary differences with the Texas House, he is not directly responsible for budget cuts.", "Budget cuts enacted during Dewhurst": "s tenure: The expert mentions that Dewhurst has presided over the Texas Senate during the adoption of five two-year state budgets, including two that were balanced partly by enacting cuts in the face of projected revenue shortfalls. This suggests that budget cuts have been implemented during his time in office.", "Comparison of budget figures": "Cruz, in the debate, compared the state budget figures from when Dewhurst was elected to the post in 2002 to the budget figures for 2010-11, implying that there was an increase in spending during Dewhurst's tenure. The expert confirms that these figures are accurate according to a report by the Legislative Budget Board.", "Limitations of comparing budget figures": "The expert points out that comparing the first and fourth budgets passed into law on Dewhurst's watch is not the only way to determine whether Dewhurst ever cut a penny. The latest state budget shows less spending in 2012-13 than the previous biennium, indicating that there may have been budget cuts. Additionally, the expert highlights that Cruz's cited figures include spending from all sources, including state and federal funds, which may not accurately reflect Dewhurst's control over the state budget."}
