{"The claim attributes a quote to Abraham Lincoln that he did not actually say": "The expert's verdict states that the quote is a corruption of something Lincoln said in one of his speeches, indicating that the claim is not accurate.", "The expert": "s verdict rates the claim as \"Mostly False,\" indicating that while there is an element of truth in the claim (Lincoln did speak about the perpetuation of political institutions), the specific quote attributed to him is not accurate. This rating helps to provide a clear assessment of the claim's authenticity.", "Another expert": "Michael Burlingame, a chair in Lincoln studies at the University of Illinois Springfield, is also cited in the expert's verdict.
