{"The claim is based on an email sent by the Progressive Change Campaign Committee to its Wisconsin members": "stating that Scott Walker \"has threatened to call out the National Guard if workers protest against these cuts!\"", "The claim is supported by a news release issued by Citizen Action of Wisconsin": "which condemned Walker's \"threat of force\" and referenced historical incidents of violence against workers.", "The expert requested evidence from the progressive committee to back their claim": "and they cited three news stories from February 11, but none of those reports directly quoted Walker.", "The expert analyzed Walker": "s statements during a news conference where he announced his proposals and found that while he made reference to contingency plans, he was asked about the National Guard and did not explicitly threaten to call them out in response to protests."}
