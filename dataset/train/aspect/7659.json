{"Verification through CDC statistics": "The expert's verdict mentions that the White House press office referred to statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to verify the claim. The CDC records show an increase in overdose deaths every year from 1990 to 2017, peaking at 70,669 deaths. However, provisional numbers for 2018 show a decrease of 3.8% compared to 2017.", "Confirmation by experts": "The expert cited in the verdict, Andrew Kolodny, a senior scientist at Brandeis University specializing in opioid and heroin addiction, states that the apparent decrease in overdose deaths is significant. He also mentions that the decrease is likely to be verified in the final numbers, which will be released in spring 2020.", "Factors contributing to the decrease": "The expert mentions three factors that have contributed to the apparent downturn in overdose deaths: better addiction treatment, more caution by doctors in prescribing opioids, and greater availability of Naloxone, a drug that counters opioid overdose. These factors suggest a positive trend in combating drug abuse.", "Consistency in provisional numbers": "The expert's verdict highlights that provisional numbers from the CDC show a continuing decrease in overdose deaths. The 12-month period ending April 30, 2019, recorded a 2.8% drop compared to the previous year. This consistency in the provisional data further supports the authenticity of the claim."}
