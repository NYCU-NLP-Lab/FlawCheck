{"Data analysis": "The experts conducted a thorough analysis of data on the motion of the earth's crust, specifically focusing on the San Andreas fault. They used global positioning system (GPS) data and applied statistical techniques to extract a pattern of vertical motions.", "Spatial consistency": "The experts carefully treated the data for spatial consistency, ensuring that the analysis accounted for variations in magnitude and direction across small distances. By doing so, they were able to isolate a coherent pattern of uplift and subsidence straddling the fault system in southern California.", "Validation with earthquake prediction models": "The study compared the observed vertical motions with predictions made by physical earthquake cycle models spanning several centuries. The experts found remarkable agreement between the observed motions and the predicted sense of vertical movements, providing further validation for their findings.", "Clarification of study": "s purpose: The experts emphasized that their study aimed to better understand and interpret the persistently enigmatic vertical movement data in earthquake prediction. They made it clear that their research did not directly indicate an imminent earthquake, which was often misconstrued by headline writers and social media pundits."}
