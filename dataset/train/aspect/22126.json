{"Lack of media access": "The claim suggests that media members were not allowed access during Trump's visit to the hospital, implying that this was done to stage the photo. However, it is clarified that reporters were indeed not permitted to enter the hospital while Trump was visiting.", "Testimony from anonymous sources": "The claim relies on a text message received by someone named Farid Ghalili, who allegedly heard from a friend that the women in the photo were not actual hospital staff. However, the credibility of this claim is questionable as it is based on second-hand information from anonymous sources.", "Inconsistent scrubs colors": "Some commenters raised doubts about the photo's authenticity by pointing out that the nurses in the picture were wearing different colored scrubs. This inconsistency suggests that the individuals may not be actual hospital staff. However, this alone does not prove that the photo was staged or that the nurses were paid actors.", "Confirmation from hospital staff": "The claim is debunked by the hospital itself, which confirms that the photo was not staged and the nurses were not paid actors. This official confirmation from the hospital staff adds credibility to the authenticity of the photo."}
