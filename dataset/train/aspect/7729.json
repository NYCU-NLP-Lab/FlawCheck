{"The disreputable website Got News presented images and innuendo to try and prove that Philando Castile was a member of the Crips gang": "2. Got News used an alleged mugshot of Castile, a photograph of him giving the middle finger, a photograph of a man making a \"C\" shape gesture with his arms, and a Facebook group called \"Crips\" as evidence.", "However": "the mugshot was from a previous arrest related to a traffic violation and not a gang-related crime.", "Castile": "s record showed that he had been arrested multiple times for minor traffic violations, suggesting that his encounters with law enforcement were primarily related to these offenses rather than gang activity."}
