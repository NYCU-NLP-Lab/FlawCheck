{"Mayor Allan Fung sought concessions from the city": "s police and fire unions to address the overwhelming bill for retirees and potential retirees, indicating that the city was facing a crisis due to inadequate investment in covering retirement benefits.", "The city": "s budget includes the state-mandated contribution to the Municipal Employees' Retirement System (MERS), which covers police, fire, and municipal employees. This demonstrates that the budget funds 100 percent of the local police and fire pension and other retiree benefit costs required by the state.", "The actuarial report shows that the city": "s MERS plans are funded close to 100 percent, with 95.9 percent for police retiree costs, 107.1 percent for firefighter retiree costs, and 95.1 percent for other municipal retiree costs. This indicates a high level of funding to meet pension obligations.", "However": "the old police and fire pension programs, administered by the city, are significantly underfunded, with only 18.3 percent funded for the police pension and 24.1 percent funded for the fire pension. The city has a payment plan in place to address this shortfall by 2042, but it would require an additional $231 million to fully fund these programs."}
