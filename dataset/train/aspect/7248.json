{"Historical research and analysis": "The expert referred to a law review article by Jamin Raskin, which traced American suffrage throughout history and highlighted instances where non-citizens were allowed to vote in more than 22 states. This historical research provided evidence to support the claim.", "Expert opinions": "The expert reached out to eight experts in the field of voting rights to gather a range of views on the topic. These experts' opinions and insights likely contributed to the expert's verdict on the authenticity of the claim.", "Advocacy and movement": "The expert mentioned Ron Hayduk, a political science professor and founder of the Coalition to Expand Voting Rights, who supported expanding voting rights to legal immigrants in New York City. The existence of a movement and advocacy group supporting non-citizen voting rights suggests that there is ongoing discussion and action surrounding this issue.", "Existing voting policies": "The expert mentioned that a handful of cities and towns nationwide already allow immigrants with legal residency status to vote in local matters. This suggests that there are current voting policies in place that extend voting privileges to non-citizens, supporting the idea that voting rights have not always been intrinsically tied to citizenship."}
