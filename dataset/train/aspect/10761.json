{"President Trump": "s claim: The first aspect that was employed to verify the authenticity of the claim is the actual statement made by President Trump. The expert's verdict includes the direct quote where Trump mentions the use of catapults to throw drugs over the border wall.", "Corroborating evidence": "The expert's verdict also includes information from U.S. Customs and Border Protection reports, which date back to at least 2011, that confirm the existence of catapults used to launch contraband, including drugs, across the border. This corroborating evidence supports the claim made by President Trump.", "Seizure of contraband": "The expert's verdict mentions specific instances where U.S. officials seized marijuana that was catapulted from Mexico into the United States. These seizures provide further evidence that drugs have been launched across the border using catapults, supporting the claim made by President Trump.", "Uncertainty about people being hit": "While the expert's verdict confirms the use of catapults to transport drugs across the border, it also mentions that it is uncertain whether people have been hit on the head by these sacks. This aspect highlights the limitations in verifying the claim fully and acknowledges the lack of concrete evidence regarding individuals being directly injured by drugs launched over the wall."}
