{"The claim is that Russ Feingold": "was the deciding vote on Obamacare.\" The expert's verdict confirms that Feingold did vote in favor of invoking cloture, which allowed the Senate to proceed with considering the health care reform bill.", "The expert explains that invoking cloture required 60 votes": "and all 58 Democratic senators, including Feingold, along with two independents, voted yes. This suggests that Feingold's vote was not the sole deciding vote, as there were multiple senators who voted in favor.", "The expert highlights that four days before the cloture vote": "Senate Democrats announced they had secured the 60th vote needed by reaching a compromise with Sen. Ben Nelson. This indicates that Nelson's vote was crucial in securing the passage of the bill, rather than Feingold's vote alone.", "The expert also mentions that there is no evidence provided by Johnson to support his claim that Feingold": "s vote for cloture was ever in doubt. This suggests that there is no substantial proof to assert that Feingold's vote was the decisive factor in passing the Obamacare bill."}
