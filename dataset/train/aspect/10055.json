{"Direct statements from relevant authorities": "The expert's verdict includes statements from Matthew Monkman, assistant superintendent for British Columbia\u2019s school district 54, who denies the claim of a school lockdown, and Janelle Shoihet, a spokesperson for the BC RCMP, who also denies the claim.", "Lack of corroborating evidence": "The expert's verdict mentions that Trevor Hewitt, a reporter for the local Interior News who has been covering the Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en blockade, has not heard anything about the rumor of a school lockdown. This lack of additional sources or evidence contributes to the conclusion that the claim is false.", "Contradiction with established facts": "The expert's verdict provides information about the background of the situation, including the approved route for the pipeline and the opposition from hereditary chiefs. The claim of a school lockdown due to the arrest of protesters' children contradicts this established context, further undermining its authenticity.", "Timing and spread of the claim": "The expert's verdict mentions that the Facebook post and similar ones were shared in Canada after news broke about the RCMP's actions at the activist camp. The timing and rapid spread of the claim on social media platforms can raise suspicions about its accuracy and suggest that it might be a fabrication."}
