{"Comparison with other states": "The expert reviewed the state retirement systems of all 50 states and consulted with Ron Snell, the director of state services for the National Conference of State Legislatures, to determine if Florida is the only state where state employees don't contribute to their pensions.", "Research on state retirement systems": "The expert individually researched the state retirement systems across the country to understand the various types of pension plans and contribution requirements in different states.", "Defined benefit plans": "The expert identified that most state retirement systems are based on a defined benefit plan, where the state multiplies an employee's years of service by salary and by some percentage to arrive at a pension amount. The expert also highlighted that employees in these systems are typically required to contribute some percentage of their pay to the overall pension fund.", "Adoption of 401": "k) plans: The expert noted that a few states have begun to adopt more private-sector-like 401(k) plans, where the employee voluntarily contributes to a retirement fund and the employer may match a portion of the contributions or contribute on their own. Some states also offer voluntary, optional 401(k) plans in addition to government pensions."}
