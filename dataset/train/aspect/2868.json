{"The video is a portion of a lecture given by professor Tetsuro Matsuzawa of Kyoto University": "s Primate Research Institute at the 2013 meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS). This indicates that the claim is based on a reputable source and not just a random video circulating on social media.", "Matsuzawa and his colleagues have published numerous peer": "reviewed studies based on this and similar experimental setups, and have been conducting experiments similar to the one shown in the video since 1978. This demonstrates a long history of research and scientific investigation into the chimpanzee's cognitive abilities, adding credibility to the claim.", "The 2013 paper written by Matsuzawa summarizes the methodology and findings of the decades": "long project, providing specific details about the experimental setup and the chimpanzees' performance. This indicates that there is scientific documentation supporting the claim and that the results have been published in a peer-reviewed journal.", "The young chimpanzees in the study performed better in terms of speed and accuracy than both their own mothers and human adults": "This suggests that the chimpanzees' ability to rapidly memorize and recall the location of numbers is exceptional and goes beyond what humans are capable of, further supporting the authenticity of the claim."}
