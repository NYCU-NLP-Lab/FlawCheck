{"The claim made by Rep": "Michele Bachmann that the IRS is \"going to be in charge of our health care\" is examined and analyzed in the expert's verdict.", "The expert highlights Rep": "Bachmann's reference to an inspector general's report critical of the IRS' scrutiny of conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status. This report is used as evidence to support the claim that the IRS may make decisions based on politics and beliefs.", "The expert mentions the various roles that the IRS has in implementing the health care law": "including levying additional payroll taxes on high-income Americans, taxation of medical devices and brand-name drugs, confirming taxpayer's health insurance, and assessing penalties for those without insurance.", "The expert acknowledges that while the IRS does play a role in implementing aspects of the health care law": "such as confirming insurance and approving subsidies, it would be a stretch to say that the IRS has complete control over individuals' health care decisions."}
