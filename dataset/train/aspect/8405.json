{"Testimony from Austin lawyer Gary Bledsoe": "The expert's verdict mentions the remarks made by Austin lawyer Gary Bledsoe, president of the state NAACP conference, during a meeting of the motor vehicle board. Bledsoe explicitly stated that the particular Confederate battle flag in question never flew over Texas. This testimony serves as evidence to verify the claim.", "Historical description of the Confederate battle flag": "The expert's verdict includes a description of the Confederate battle flag as a red ground with a blue saltire, bordered with white and emblazoned with white five-pointed stars. This description aligns with the proposed design of the license plates, which feature a red, white, and blue flag design tracing back to the Confederacy. The historical description supports the claim that the flag never flew over Texas.", "Identification of the flag with the Sons of Confederate Veterans": "The expert's verdict mentions that the flag's look has long been the identifying emblem of the Sons of Confederate Veterans. This association further reinforces the claim that the flag never flew over Texas, as it is primarily linked to this organization rather than any historical presence in the state.", "Expert confirmation of alternative flags flown over Texas": "The expert's verdict states that up to three flags of the Confederate States of America may have flown over the Texas Capitol during the war, but none of them were the flag of Lee's army. While two of these flags incorporated the look of Lee's army flag, they were not the exact same flag. This expert confirmation provides additional evidence to support the claim that the Confederate battle flag in question never flew over Texas."}
