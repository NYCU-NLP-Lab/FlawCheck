{"Lack of official police count": "The expert mentions that counting people at Washington protests has always been a tricky business, and police estimates were often lower than the claims made by organizers. The absence of an official police count makes it difficult to verify the authenticity of the claim.", "Independent assessment by news media": "With no official count available, the news media becomes the only source for an independent assessment of crowd size. Different news outlets provided varying estimates of the number of attendees, ranging from \"an estimated 10,000\" to \"thousands\" of people.", "Comparison with visitor count at the Air and Space Museum": "Bob Beckel, a Democratic consultant, claimed that there were more people at the Air and Space Museum on the same day as the rally. To verify this, the expert checked with the National Air and Space Museum and obtained the official visitor count of 9,771 for that day.", "Testimony from reporters who covered the event": "The expert reached out to two reporters who covered the rally to understand how they arrived at their estimates. Jonathan Allen from Politico explained his methodology, which could provide additional insights into the crowd size."}
