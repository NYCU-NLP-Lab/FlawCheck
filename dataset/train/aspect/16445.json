{"Number of states won": "The expert mentions that Obama claimed to have won twice as many states as Clinton. The expert verifies this claim by stating that at the time of Obama's statement, he had won 25 states compared to Clinton's 14 states (excluding Florida and Michigan).", "Popular vote share": "Obama also claimed to have won a greater share of the popular vote. The expert verifies this claim by stating that when excluding Michigan and Florida, Obama was ahead in the popular vote with 13,002,527 votes compared to Clinton's 12,413,052 votes. If Florida is included but not Michigan, Obama still leads with 13,578,741 votes compared to Clinton's 13,284,038 votes.", "Caucus states": "The expert mentions that some states that held caucuses, such as Iowa, Nevada, Washington, and Maine, had not released popular vote totals. This aspect makes it difficult to fully verify the claim regarding the popular vote share.", "Exclusion of Michigan": "The expert notes that the results from Michigan are in limbo because the Democratic National Committee has not recognized them. Obama was also not on the ballot in Michigan. The expert suggests that to be fail-safe, Obama should have specified that he was excluding Michigan when claiming a greater share of the popular vote."}
