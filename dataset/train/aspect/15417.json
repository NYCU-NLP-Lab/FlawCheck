{"The expert investigated the Supreme Court decision in the case of Citizens United vs": "Federal Election Commission to verify the claim. This case involved the striking down of parts of the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform law and the ruling on the use of general treasury funds by companies and unions for financing ads related to federal elections.", "The expert examined the majority opinion of the Supreme Court in the Citizens United case": "which upheld the disclosure aspects of the McCain-Feingold law. This indicates that the majority of the justices agreed that disclosure of special interest money is constitutional and recommended it.", "The expert analyzed the dissenting opinion in the Citizens United case": "which listed four justices who disagreed with the majority on various aspects but agreed on the importance of disclosure. This suggests that eight out of nine justices recognized the value of disclosure requirements.", "The expert considered the lone dissenting justice": "Clarence Thomas, who argued that even the disclosure aspects of the law are unconstitutional. This provides a contrasting perspective but does not undermine the fact that the majority of justices supported disclosure."}
