{"Perennial candidate Robert J": "Healey Jr.'s platform: Healey is running on the platform that the lieutenant governor's job is a do-nothing position that should be eliminated. He stated that he would work towards eliminating the office if elected.", "Citations provided by Healey": "Healey sent more than a dozen citations of newspaper and magazine articles to support his claim that there is much buzz about eliminating the office. However, most of these citations were opinion or commentary pieces with no evidence of current wider discussion, broad-based movements, or legislative action.", "Failed legislative efforts": "Several articles referenced legislative efforts in Illinois and Louisiana to eliminate the lieutenant governor's office, but these attempts never got off the ground. The stories preceded the failed attempts, indicating that there was no ongoing discussion about eliminating the office in these states.", "Verification from state representatives and editors": "The fact-checkers contacted state librarians, legislators, and editors at major newspapers in the seven states specifically mentioned by Healey. They found no evidence to support Healey's claim that these states were currently discussing the need for the lieutenant governor's office. For example, the political editor for the Salt Lake Tribune stated that there had been no talk of eliminating the office of lieutenant governor in Utah."}
