{"The expert": "s verdict highlights that multiple lines of evidence support the use of face masks to protect against the coronavirus, although there may be some uncertainty about their effectiveness in preventing community spread.", "The expert points out that a few randomized controlled trials have shown that providing free masks and promoting their use can lead to a small to moderate reduction in transmission": "although these results may not always be statistically significant.", "The expert emphasizes that masks should not be seen as foolproof": "as no mask can offer complete protection to the wearer or others. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends wearing the most protective mask that fits well and can be worn consistently, with loosely woven cloth masks being the least protective and N95 respirators being the most protective.", "The expert highlights that the claims made by the individual in the Facebook video": "stating that masks are \"unsafe\" and \"ineffective,\" are false, misleading, or unsupported. Recent evidence, including a publication in the Journal of the American Medical Association, supports the effectiveness of community mask wearing in reducing the spread of the virus."}
