{"Multiple sources sharing the video": "The claim was verified by examining various sources, including Twitter accounts of BJP MP Shobha Karandlaje and Mahesh Vikram Hegde, as well as a Facebook post by Vivek Shetty. These sources all shared the video claiming that Mamata Banerjee was taunted with Jai Shri Ram slogans at Raj Bhavan.", "Analysis of the video": "The authenticity of the claim was also verified by analyzing the video itself. Alt News found that the original video, uploaded by an India Today correspondent, had different audio from the widely circulated clip. The original video showed Mamata Banerjee greeting BJP Bengal chief Dilip Ghosh at the state assembly, not at Raj Bhavan.", "Contextual information": "The expert's verdict also took into account the context surrounding the claim. It was mentioned that Mamata Banerjee had previously been greeted with Jai Shri Ram slogans during her campaign for the Arambagh Lok Sabha seat. This provided additional context and background information to evaluate the authenticity of the claim.", "Comparison of claims with facts": "The expert's verdict compared the claims made in the video with factual information. It was noted that the video did not actually show Mamata Banerjee being taunted with Jai Shri Ram slogans at Raj Bhavan, as claimed. Instead, it showed a different interaction between Mamata Banerjee and Dilip Ghosh at the state assembly. This comparison helped establish the inaccuracy of the claim."}
