{"The claim is based on Congresswoman Betty Sutton": "s 2010 vote to pass the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, also known as \"Obamacare,\" which aimed to make health care readily available to uninsured Americans but also slowed the rate at which Medicare would grow over the next decade.", "The claim suggests that Betty Sutton": "voted to destroy Medicare,\" but the expert's verdict states that this is a misleading representation of the facts. The Affordable Care Act actually projected a growth of $7.1 trillion in Medicare spending over a decade, which means that Medicare would still grow, albeit at a slower rate.", "The expert": "s verdict also mentions that the savings in Medicare spending would come from eliminating waste and duplication, as well as from making changes to the Medicare Advantage program. This suggests that the claim's assertion of Sutton \"voting to destroy Medicare\" is an exaggeration and does not accurately represent the impact of the Affordable Care Act on the program."}
