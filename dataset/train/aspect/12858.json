{"The claim was verified by comparing the statement made by President Donald Trump in his tweet with the information provided in the attached Fox News report": "The report presented statistics that supported the claim of a 7.8% increase in coal production in the past year.", "The U": "S. Energy Information Administration\u2019s Short-term Energy Outlook report for October was consulted to gather data on coal production. The report provided a forecast for 2017, which predicted a 7.8% rise in coal production from 2016 to 2017.", "The government report also indicated that actual coal production in the first nine months of the year was 12": "higher than the previous year. This information suggests that the claim of a 7.8% increase in coal production in the past year might be an understatement.", "However": "it is important to note that the government does not expect the increase in coal production to continue. The same energy outlook report stated that coal production is expected to increase by only 8% in 2017 and less than 1% in 2018. This information adds context to the claim and suggests that the current increase in coal production might not be sustainable in the long term."}
