{"The expert": "s statement is supported by the experiences of two of his Atlanta-area clients who applied for second jobs and were told by their potential employers that their identifications associated with their Social Security numbers were being used elsewhere. This indicates that there is a requirement for government permission to get a second job.", "The expert mentions that the Senate immigration bill includes a provision mandating employers to enroll in the federal E": "Verify program within five years. E-Verify is a federal Internet-based system that allows employers to verify the eligibility of their workers. This provision suggests that there is a mechanism in place to monitor and control employment authorization.", "The E": "Verify system compares information from a worker's employment verification form with federal data records to confirm employment eligibility. When the information does not match, potential workers receive a \"tentative nonconfirmation\" from the government, which they can contest within eight days. This process demonstrates that there is a system in place to verify the authenticity of employment information.", "The purpose of the E": "Verify system is to prevent ineligible individuals from obtaining jobs and to detect fraudulent activity, including identity theft. While not nationally mandated for private employers, some have voluntarily enrolled in the program for over a decade. This suggests that there is a recognized need to ensure the authenticity of employment documents and prevent fraudulent practices."}
