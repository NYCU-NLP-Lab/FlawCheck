Postal Service: The U.S. Postal Service has been facing financial difficulties due to the impact of COVID-19. However, a USPS spokesman clarified that their current financial condition will not affect their ability to deliver mail-in ballots this year. This aspect confirms that the claim about cutting off money for the post office to hinder mail-in ballots is not supported by the USPS's financial situation.", "Lack of evidence from Trump": "The fact-checking analysis states that there is no instance of President Trump explicitly stating that he wants to hinder the Postal Service's ability to deliver mail-in ballots. The Biden campaign also did not provide any evidence to support their claim. This aspect highlights the absence of direct statements from Trump supporting the claim.", "Trump": "s opposition to mail-in ballots: While Trump has been vocal in his opposition to the expansion of mail-in ballots due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this does not necessarily imply a deliberate attempt to cut off funding for the Postal Service. This aspect acknowledges Trump's stance against mail-in voting but does not confirm the specific claim made by Biden."}
