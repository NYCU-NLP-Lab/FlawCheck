{"The timing of the photos": "The expert noted that the photos were published on Facebook on November 17, 2019, just one day before a violent standoff between pro-democracy demonstrators and police at Hong Kong Polytechnic University. This suggests a possible connection between the photos and the ongoing protests in Hong Kong.", "Multiple sources": "The expert pointed out that the same images were published on multiple social media platforms, including Facebook and Twitter, with similar claims. This indicates that the photos were being widely shared and discussed in relation to the protests.", "Reverse image search": "The expert conducted a reverse image search and found that one of the photos of a police sniper was published by Reuters in September 2018, showing the sniper on the roof opposite the Cologne Central Mosque in Germany. This suggests that the photo was not taken during the Hong Kong protests, but rather in a different context.", "Photo captions and reports": "The expert referenced the captions and reports accompanying the photos. The caption of the police sniper photo from Reuters clearly states that it was taken in Germany in 2018. Additionally, AFP and Reuters reports were cited to provide further context and verification of the photos' authenticity."}
