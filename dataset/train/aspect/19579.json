{"Comparison of annual oil production data": "The expert analyzed the annual oil production data from 2003 to 2010 to verify the claim. By comparing the production levels for each year, they were able to determine that 2010 had the highest oil production since 2003.", "Stability of production levels": "The expert noted that despite the increase in oil production from 2009 to 2010, the overall production levels remained relatively stable over the eight-year period. This aspect suggests that the increase mentioned in the claim was not particularly significant or dramatic.", "Projection of future production decline": "The expert referred to the Energy Information Administration's projections, which indicated that domestic crude oil production was expected to decline in the coming years. This aspect suggests that the claim about reaching the highest level of oil production in 2010 may not be sustainable in the future.", "Focus on oil production from U": "S. territory: The expert specifically focused on oil production from U.S. territory, excluding natural gas or other petroleum products. This aspect ensures that the analysis is aligned with the claim made by President Obama, who specifically mentioned oil production in his statement."}
