{"Incorrect ZIP code": "The expert noticed that the ZIP code mentioned in the prescription, \"34108,\" did not correspond to Memphis, Tennessee, where Elvis Presley resided. This discrepancy indicated that the document was likely a forgery, as the correct ZIP code for the Memphis address is \"38104.\"", "Misspelled name": "The expert pointed out that the forged prescription misspelled Elvis Presley's doctor's name as \"George Nichopolous\" instead of the correct spelling, \"George Nichopoulos.\" This error raised doubts about the authenticity of the document, as it is unlikely for a doctor to misspell their own name.", "Signature inconsistency": "The handwriting on the forged prescription did not match Dr. Nichopoulos' actual signature. The expert provided a comparison of the forged signature with the doctor's genuine signature from a loan agreement signed in 1975. This discrepancy further supported the claim that the prescription was not authentic.", "Historical accuracy": "Although the prescription was determined to be a forgery, the expert acknowledged that it reflected some historical realities. The drugs listed on the faux prescription were frequently prescribed to Elvis Presley by Dr. Nichopoulos during his treatment. The expert mentioned the various drugs and their purposes, highlighting the historical context surrounding the singer's drug use and the controversy surrounding Dr. Nichopoulos' medical practices."}
