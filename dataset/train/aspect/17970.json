This confirmation from the relevant authority helps verify the authenticity of the claim.", "Lack of evidence for the claim": "The expert's verdict states that despite the claim of an announcement by the state government, no evidence could be found to support it. This lack of supporting evidence further questions the authenticity of the claim.", "Existing youth hunting events": "The expert's verdict mentions that the Department of Game & Inland Fisheries website outlines various youth hunting events, including upcoming ones. These events contradict the claim of the end of youth hunting and provide evidence against it.", "Gun control proposal clarification": "The expert's verdict explains that the confusion regarding the age \"to shoot a gun\" arises from a gun control proposal by Governor Ralph Northam.
