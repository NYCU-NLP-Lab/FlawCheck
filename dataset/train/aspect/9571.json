{"The claim is supported by the statement made by Democratic Rep": "John Boccieri, who stated that the \"cap and trade\" concept was originally a Republican idea and that John McCain introduced cap and trade legislation three times.", "The claim is further supported by the fact that MIT economics professor Richard Schmalensee and Harvard Kennedy School government professor Robert Stavins noted that Republicans": "including Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, have previously implemented \"cap-and-trade\" systems to address environmental issues.", "The claim is also backed by the existence of the": "Climate Stewardship Act\" introduced by Republican Senator John McCain and Democratic Senator Joe Lieberman in 2003, which aimed to tackle carbon emissions through a similar cap-and-trade approach.", "The claim is reinforced by the criticism and opposition faced by Democratic Rep": "John Boccieri from Republicans for his vote on a House energy bill that included a \"cap and trade\" system, indicating that Republicans were indeed against the concept despite its Republican origins."}
