{"The article cites a 2015 study that allegedly found cloth masks lead to a higher rate of infection due to": "retained moisture\" and \"poor filtration.\" This study is presented as evidence against the efficacy of cloth masks.", "Two additional reports are mentioned": "one stating that \"70 percent of COVID-positive patients contracted the virus in spite of faithful mask wearing while in public,\" and the other concluding that masks and respirators were \"ineffective against the spread of influenza-like illnesses and respiratory illnesses believed to be spread by droplet and aerosol particles.\" These reports are also presented as evidence against the effectiveness of masks.", "The article mentions that the CDC endorses face masks as protection against COVID": "19 and recently updated its guidance. This suggests that the claim contradicts the official stance of the CDC and questions the authenticity of the claim.", "The expert cites a 2015 randomized controlled trial that tested the efficacy of cloth masks among health care workers in Vietnam": "The trial found a higher rate of infection among those in the cloth mask group compared to the medical mask and control groups. However, the researchers attributed this to inadequate mask washing and moisture contamination rather than the masks themselves. This aspect of the expert's verdict provides a counterargument to the claim's assertion about cloth masks."}
