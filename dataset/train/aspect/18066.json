{"The expert mentions that President Donald Trump claimed that Democrats changed their mind about supporting a physical barrier only after he was elected president": "This claim is verified by stating that Sen. Chuck Schumer and many other Democrats had previously supported a physical barrier.", "The expert points out that the claim mischaracterizes the barrier that won Democratic support 13 years ago": "It is stated that just over half of Democrats in the Senate, including Schumer, Obama, and Clinton, voted for the Secure Fence Act of 2006, which authorized a fence along about 700 miles of the U.S.-Mexico border.", "The expert highlights that the fence constructed under the Secure Fence Act was different from the wall promised by Trump during his campaign": "The fence was described as \"rust-colored thick bars\" forming \"teeth-like slats,\" while Trump had promised a \"hardened concrete\" wall.", "The expert mentions that the Democrats": "offer to Trump included a continuing resolution on last year's appropriations act, providing $1.3 billion for fencing and additional funds for other types of border security. This indicates that Democrats still support some form of physical barrier, contrary to Trump's claim."}
