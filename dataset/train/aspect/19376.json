{"The initial report published by ANI titled": "Uttarakhand: Passengers to be charged during rescue operations\" provided the basis for the claim. The report included a notification issued by the state Civil Aviation Development Authority addressed to the District Magistrate of Pithoragarh, which stated that passengers would be charged for availing helicopters during rescue operations.", "The claim was further supported by the fact that the story was picked up by other reputable news outlets such as NDTV": "Deccan Chronicle, and India Times. This indicates that multiple sources found the information credible enough to report on.", "Social media reactions also played a role in verifying the claim": "Tweets from prominent individuals, including former JNUSU Vice President Shehla Rashid and national social media in-charge of Indian Youth Congress Vaibhav Walia, expressed outrage over the news. Their reactions suggest that the claim was widely perceived as authentic.", "The response from Uttarakhand Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat also contributed to the verification process": "He refuted ANI's reportage and clarified that a government order dated July 4 had provided clear directives to use the helicopters for rescue operations at no cost to evacuees. The CM's response, along with the attached government order, contradicts the initial claim and supports the authenticity of the government's stance."}
