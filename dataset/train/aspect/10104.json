{"The expert examined a fundraising letter from Democratic strategist Paul Begala": "in which he claimed that Ken Cuccinelli attacked churches for helping the poor. This letter served as the initial source of the claim.", "The expert analyzed an article in The Virginian": "Pilot that reported on a keynote address given by Cuccinelli at the Cherish Life Ministries Christian Life Summit. The article included a video of Cuccinelli's speech, which showed him criticizing Catholic church leaders.", "The expert highlighted a specific comment made by Cuccinelli during his speech": "where he stated that Catholic bishops have helped create a culture of dependency on government, not God. This comment was used by Begala to support his claim that Cuccinelli attacked churches for helping the poor.", "The expert evaluated Cuccinelli": "s overall argument in his speech and in his book, \"The Last Line of Defense,\" where he expressed his belief that churches should not rely on government to fulfill their charitable role.
