{"Use of Bureau of Labor Statistics data": "The expert's verdict mentions that Sutton's office used databases from the Bureau of Labor Statistics Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages to compute the statistic. This indicates that the authenticity of the claim was verified by referring to official data sources.", "Comparison of manufacturing establishments over time": "The expert's verdict states that the number of private manufacturing establishments in the United States declined from 398,887 in the first quarter of 2001 to 342,647 by the end of 2010. This comparison of data over a specific time period helps to validate the claim about the loss of factories.", "Calculation of average yearly and daily factory loss": "The expert's verdict mentions that the average yearly loss of factories over a 10-year period was calculated to be 5,619. Dividing this by the 365 days in a year produces an average daily number of 15.39 factories lost. This calculation provides a specific figure to support the claim made by Sutton.", "Confirmation by Bureau of Labor Statistics": "The expert's verdict includes a statement from the Bureau of Labor Statistics spokesman, Gary Steinberg, who confirms that Sutton used the correct data to arrive at her figure. While he suggests that specifying the time period of the shutdowns would have made the statement more precise, his confirmation adds credibility to the claim."}
