["A map demonstrates the population disparity between densely populated Los\nAngeles County and much of the U.S.\n\n     * David Mikkelson\n     * Published 24 March 2019\n   Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Pinterest Share on Reddit\n   Share via Email\n\n  Claim\n\n   A map demonstrates the population disparity between densely populated Los\n   Angeles County and much of the U.S.", "First of all, the ambiguous wording of the text accompanying the image\n   (\u201cThat county has the same population as ALL of the blue sections\u201d) has\n   been misinterpreted by many viewers to mean that more people reside in Los\n   Angeles County (represented by the red dot) than in all of the states\n   colored blue on the map combined.", "The text means\n   that the population of Los Angeles County is greater than the population\n   of all but a handful of individual states.", "According to the most recent population estimates\n   available from the U.S. Census Bureau for Los Angeles County (July 2017)\n   and individual states, the populations of Georgia (10,519,475) and North\n   Carolina (10,383,620) are slightly higher than that of Los Angeles County\n   (10,163,507) so those two states should not be colored blue on the map\n   seen above."]
