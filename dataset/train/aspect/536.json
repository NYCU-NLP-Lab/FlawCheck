{"The claim is based on a single event in 2015 where Saith Technologies displayed their inventions": "including the electric car, during an \"Open Day\" that was well-publicized and garnered media attention.", "The authenticity of the claim relies heavily on the photographic evidence from that one day in 2015": "as all the images used to support the existence of Chikumbutso's inventions are from that event.", "The claim mentions the": "Greener Power Machine\" (GPM) as a key component of the electric car, which supposedly amplifies the power generated by regular batteries, allowing the car to run perpetually without needing a charge.", "The expert notes that the claim breaks the laws of physics by suggesting that the GPM produces more energy than is put into the device": "which raises doubts about the authenticity of the invention."}
