{"The expert clarified that George Floyd was indeed involved in an armed robbery in 2007 and was sentenced to five years in prison for his involvement": "This information verifies the claim that Floyd had a criminal record related to armed robbery.", "The expert provided evidence that the woman robbed in the incident": "Aracely Henriquez, was actually injured by another man and there is no evidence to suggest that she was pregnant at the time. This contradicts the claim that Floyd assaulted a pregnant woman during the robbery.", "The expert pointed out that the photo circulating on social media": "showing a woman with bruises on her face, is not of Aracely Henriquez. They identified the woman in the photo as Andrea Sicignano, an American student who was assaulted and raped in Madrid in 2018.

This context emphasizes the need for fact-checking and verifying claims before accepting them as true."}
