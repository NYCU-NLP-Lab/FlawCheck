{"The claim is supported by reports of a U": "S. Supreme Court ruling that upheld North Dakota laws, which critics argue could prevent Native American voters from casting their ballots. This aspect verifies the claim by providing a legal context and highlighting the potential impact on Native American voters.", "The NDN Collective": "an advocacy group for indigenous peoples, posted a widely-shared meme that specifically addresses the issue of voter suppression in North Dakota. This aspect supports the claim by presenting a direct statement from a credible source advocating for the rights of Native American voters.", "Progressive writer Brandon Weber also shared the same meme": "adding his own introductory message about the U.S. Supreme Court's decision to eliminate voting rights for 70,000 Native Americans in North Dakota. This aspect reinforces the claim by providing additional commentary from a respected writer, further emphasizing the impact on Native American voters.", "The North Dakota voter ID laws themselves provide evidence of the restrictions disproportionately affecting Native American voters": "The laws initially allowed various forms of identification for voter verification, including tribal IDs. However, subsequent legislation limited the acceptable forms of ID to only three options, including a tribal ID. This aspect confirms the claim by highlighting the changes in voter ID requirements that specifically impact Native American voters."}
