{"The timing of the claim": "The expert points out that the claim of Samsung paying off the $1.05 billion judgment in nickels came just a few days after the jury decision was made. This is highly unlikely, as such large damages are not paid off quickly, and the judge had not yet given her final decision.", "Lack of official payment method": "The expert highlights that the signed document did not specify a single payment method, giving Samsung the freedom to choose the method they deemed best. This suggests that the claim of paying in nickels may not be accurate.", "Unlikelihood of immediate payment": "The expert mentions that even if the verdict was final and Samsung had to pay damages, it would take months or even years for the payment to be made, likely through rounds of appeals and potential settlements. This contradicts the claim of immediate payment in nickels.", "Impracticality of paying in nickels": "The expert calculates that paying off a billion dollars in nickels would require 20 billion coins. This immense quantity makes it highly impractical and unlikely for Samsung to choose this method of payment."}
