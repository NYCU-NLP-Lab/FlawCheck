{"Lack of evidence on Twitter timelines": "The expert found no evidence of the tweets from former Presidents Obama, Clinton, and Bush on their respective Twitter timelines. This suggests that the tweets mocking President Trump's claim were not actually posted by them.", "Unlikelihood of coordination": "The expert argues that it would be highly unlikely for the three former presidents to coordinate a social media joke to mock President Trump and then delete their posts without being detected by mainstream media sources. This casts doubt on the authenticity of the claim.", "Inconsistent retweeting patterns": "The expert mentions that messages sent by President Obama and Clinton are routinely retweeted thousands of times, yet no retweets linking back to the original messages were found. This further undermines the credibility of the claim.", "Trump": "s previous political attempts: The expert highlights that while Obama, Clinton, and Bush all won presidential elections on their first attempts, Trump's claim of winning on his first try is a matter of debate. Trump had previously run for the nomination of the Reform Party in 2000 but withdrew before the election. This raises questions about the accuracy of his claim."}
