{"The expert": "s verdict states that President Trump claimed that under past administrations, the border didn't go down, it went up. The expert's analysis reveals that this claim is not accurate, as there have been declines in apprehensions of immigrants trying to enter the country illegally under previous administrations.", "President Trump uses different timeframes to support his claim that illegal immigration is down": "He cites year-over-year March border apprehension data to claim a 64 percent decline, compares February 2017 numbers to November 2016 to claim a 61 percent decline, and states a 40 percent decline from January to February. However, the expert points out that these calculations do not show a 78 percent decline.", "The expert notes that the source of the 78 percent figure is unclear": "as the White House did not respond to their inquiry. This raises questions about the accuracy and validity of the claim.", "The expert provides data from U": "S. Customs and Border Protection, which shows that apprehensions at the southwest border declined by 53 percent from June 2016 to June 2017. Additionally, apprehensions by border patrol agents declined about 66 percent from November to June and 49 percent from January to June. These figures contradict the claim of a 78 percent decline."}
