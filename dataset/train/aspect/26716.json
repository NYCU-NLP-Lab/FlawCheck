{"Multiple studies published in peer": "reviewed scientific journals support the claim that 97 percent or more of actively publishing climate scientists agree that climate-warming trends are very likely due to human activities. This provides a strong foundation for the authenticity of the claim.", "The research conducted by John Cook and his team": "which examined 11,944 abstracts of climate science reports, found that 97.1 percent of the studies that expressed an opinion endorsed the consensus position that humans are causing global warming. This adds further credibility to the claim.", "Richard Tol": "a professor with the Institute for Environmental Studies in Amsterdam, disputes the 97 percent figure, arguing that it is based on an unrepresentative sample of climate science papers. However, his criticism does not invalidate the other studies and research that support the claim.", "The distinction made by the federal space agency": "which notes that the 97 percent figure specifically refers to \"actively publishing climate scientists,\" provides clarity and highlights the need to consider the specific group being referred to when discussing the consensus on human contributions to climate change."}
