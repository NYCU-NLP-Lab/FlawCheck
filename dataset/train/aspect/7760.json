{"The claim is based on a study conducted by The Wall Street Journal that analyzed data from police departments in the 15 largest cities in the country": "2. The study compared the number of homicides recorded for the first six months of 2020 with the number of homicides recorded over the same period last year.", "The analysis found that Austin had the largest percentage change in total homicides": "with a 64.3% increase from the first half of 2019.", "The claim lacks important context about crime and homicides in Austin": "as the number of homicides in the city is much lower than in other cities, which means any change will result in a large percent increase compared with earlier years."}
