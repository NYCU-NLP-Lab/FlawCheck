{"The claim was made by Michael Needham": "CEO of Heritage Action for America, in defense of the Republican Senate health care proposal.", "Needham": "s statement about deaths for those on Medicaid compared with the uninsured was sourced from a 2011 Wall Street Journal op-ed by Scott Gottlieb, who is now the FDA commissioner.", "Gottlieb cited four studies about the outcomes of patients on Medicaid for certain types of procedures": "but three of the authors of those studies disputed his conclusions.", "The largest study": "conducted by the University of Virginia and published in 2010, found that Medicaid patients were more likely to die following a procedure than the uninsured, but this was attributed to the fact that Medicaid patients tend to begin treatment in poorer health. Dr. Irving Kron, one of the key researchers for the study, stated that Needham's conclusion is incorrect."}
