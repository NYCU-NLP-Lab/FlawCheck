{"The claim suggests that consumers are not obligated to pay back debt that creditors have written off and sold": "2. The expert's verdict explains that this claim is a form of urban folklore or \"legal talisman\" text, which often misleads people into thinking they can avoid paying their debts by invoking a little-known legal stratagem.", "The expert clarifies that debt can legally be sold or assigned": "and a creditor's decision to do so does not relieve the debtor of their obligation to pay. The fact that the original creditor has written off the debt does not remove the debtor's legal responsibility to pay the full amount to the debt purchaser.", "The expert also emphasizes that the claim": "s suggestion that negative information about a debt must be removed from a consumer's credit report when it is sold to a collection agency is false. Legally incurred debts, regardless of the entity holding the right to collect them, can still be validly reported to credit reporting agencies."}
