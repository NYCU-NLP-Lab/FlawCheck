{"Use of official employment data": "The expert employed state-level statistics from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which is considered the federal government's official source of employment data. This ensured that the numbers used to verify the claim were accurate and reliable.", "Comparison with other states": "The expert compared Massachusetts' job growth ranking to that of other states, specifically ranking it 47th out of 50 states (excluding the District of Columbia) during Mitt Romney's tenure as governor. This comparison provided context and allowed for a fair assessment of Massachusetts' job creation performance.", "Calculation of percentage change": "To determine the job growth ranking, the expert calculated the percentage change in the number of jobs from December 2002 to December 2006. This method of analysis allowed for a quantitative assessment of the job creation situation in Massachusetts during Romney's governorship.", "Consideration of external factors": "The expert acknowledged the limited impact that a governor's policies have on a state's economy. They consulted economists and Michael Widmer, president of the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, to understand the broader factors influencing job growth in the state. This consideration of external factors helped provide a more comprehensive evaluation of Romney's influence on job creation in Massachusetts."}
