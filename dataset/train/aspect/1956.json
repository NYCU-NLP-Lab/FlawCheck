{"Monthly jobs estimates": "The expert mentions that Governor Walker's office provided monthly jobs estimates based on government surveys of a small sample of employers. These estimates showed that 2013 had the highest private job growth since 1999.", "U": "S. Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages: The expert acknowledges that the job-count data reported in the U.S. Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages is considered more reliable. However, the latest figures from this source only run through September 2013, so the governor's use of the monthly estimates is deemed fair game.", "Percentage of growth": "The expert mentions that researchers they spoke to believe that the percentage of growth is a better measure because economies grow over time. In this case, the 1.66 percent growth in 2013 was the best since 1999.", "Comparison to previous years": "The expert notes that Laura Dresser, a labor economist and associate director of the Center on Wisconsin Strategy, stated that the job growth numbers in 2013 didn't surprise her. She mentioned that the 2000s had two national recessions and three years (2001 and 2008-09) with significant job losses in Wisconsin's private market. The expert implies that comparing the job growth in 2013 to previous years is another aspect used to verify the claim."}
