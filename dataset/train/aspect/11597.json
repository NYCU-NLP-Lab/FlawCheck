{"The claim was sourced from the 2007 edition of the Drug Guide for Mental Health Professionals": "a specialty edition of the Physician's Desk Reference. However, the source does not provide any specific citation or reference to verify the claim.", "The statement itself is ambiguous": "as it could be interpreted as either marijuana smoke having 50 to 70 percent more cancer-causing chemicals or having a 50 to 70 percent greater concentration of cancer-causing chemicals.", "In an effort to verify the claim": "the concentration of cancer-causing chemicals in marijuana smoke was compared to that of tobacco smoke. Two studies conducted by Dr. Donald Tashkin of the University of California at Los Angeles found that two specific carcinogens in marijuana smoke were indeed higher than in tobacco smoke, supporting the claim.", "However": "it was also discovered that the concentrations of other cancer-causing chemicals in marijuana smoke were lower by as much as 73 percent, indicating that not all cancer-causing chemicals in marijuana smoke are higher than in tobacco smoke."}
