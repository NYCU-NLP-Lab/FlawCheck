{"The origin and source of the photograph": "The expert investigated the source of the photograph and found that it was not recent and did not show refuse left behind by the caravan of refugees traveling from Honduras to the U.S.-Mexico border in October 2018. The photograph was reportedly taken by a Polish blogger near the border between Austria and Germany in September 2015.", "Comparison with other documented incidents": "The expert compared the claim with other documented incidents of refugees leaving garbage behind during their journey. A video report from the BBC confirmed that a group of refugees near the Austria-Germany border had left a large amount of garbage in their wake as they moved to a new location. This comparison helped verify the authenticity of the claim.", "Examination of online criticism and reactions": "The expert examined online criticism and reactions to the claim, especially from fellow Syrians and Europeans concerned about refugee numbers. The presence of critical comments, tweets, and retweets mentioning the rubbish piles left behind by refugees provided additional evidence to verify the claim.", "Social media posts by refugees themselves": "The expert found that refugees were also active on social media and some were posting pictures and messages urging fellow travelers to clean up after themselves. This aspect further supported the authenticity of the claim as it showed that refugees themselves were aware of the issue and were taking steps to address it."}
