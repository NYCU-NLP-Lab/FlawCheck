{"Timing": "The expert pointed out that the claim was made in August 2018, whereas Time magazine typically announces their \"Person of the Year\" in December. This discrepancy in timing raised doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Lack of official announcement": "The expert mentioned that as of their knowledge, neither the shortlist of candidates nor the actual announcement for Time's \"Person of the Year\" had been made. This lack of official confirmation further cast doubt on the claim.", "Source of the image": "The expert highlighted that the image used for the purported Time cover actually came from a GQ cover story about Colin Kaepernick in November 2017. This indicated that the image was not genuine and had been misrepresented.", "Content of the claim": "The expert stated that the claim falsely asserted that Colin Kaepernick had been named Time magazine's \"Person of the Year\" for 2018. The expert clarified that Kaepernick had been named \"Citizen of the Year\" by GQ in 2017 but had not received the same recognition from Time."}
