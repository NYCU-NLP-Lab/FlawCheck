Despite being attributed to him by various sources, none of them provided any specific details about its origin.", "Absence in documented quotes": "Another aspect that was used to verify the claim was the thorough examination of several volumes of quotes compiled from Mark Twain's writings. Despite the extensive documentation of his work, the quote in question was not found in any of these sources, raising doubts about its authenticity.", "Expert opinion": "Barbara Schmidt, the operator of TwainQuotes.com, was consulted for her expertise in Mark Twain's quotes. She confirmed that she had no evidence of Twain writing or uttering the specific phrase. This expert opinion adds weight to the skepticism surrounding the claim.", "Similar opinion expressed by Mark Twain": "The final aspect employed to verify the claim was the discovery of a passage from the Autobiography of Mark Twain, Volume 2, where he expressed a similar opinion about the power of a lie.

This suggests that while the specific quote may not be authentic, it is consistent with Twain's beliefs."}
