{"The claim is attributed to House Speaker Dean Cannon": "who was quoted in an interview with the St. Petersburg Times' political blog \"The Buzz\" on December 8, 2010. This establishes the source of the claim and the context in which it was made.", "The claim states that freshmen lawmakers account for one": "third of the 120-member House, and that two-thirds of the chamber have two years or less experience. This provides specific numerical figures that can be fact-checked.", "The expert mentions the background on term limits in Florida": "including the \"Eight is Enough\" campaign and the limitations of eight years in office for Cabinet members and legislators. This information provides context and explains the potential reasons for a high number of freshmen lawmakers.", "The expert refers to the National Conference of State Legislatures": "which provides background information on proposals to limit the terms of state legislators. This suggests that there is a broader national perspective on the issue of term limits and turnover in legislatures."}
