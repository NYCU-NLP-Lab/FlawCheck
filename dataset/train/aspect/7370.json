{"The presence of a sleeping walrus atop a Russian submarine undergoing repairs in 2006": "which is supported by the original photograph and corroborated by other similar images featuring the same walrus.", "The identification of a doctored version of the photograph": "which includes the insertion of a man standing behind the walrus with his arms raised high and flashing peace signs. This manipulation can be observed by comparing the original and doctored versions of the image.", "The lack of evidence to support the claim that the submarine crew was inconvenienced by the sleeping walrus blocking the hatch": "No reports or credible sources were found to corroborate this specific claim.", "The unlikelihood of the crew being inconvenienced by the walrus": "considering that the submarine was docked and undergoing repairs at the time of the photograph, and it likely had multiple hatches available for crew members to exit. This is supported by the nature of the submarine being a large nuclear submarine with multiple access points."}
