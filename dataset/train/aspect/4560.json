{"Lack of evidence for a policy to classify all deaths as COVID": "19 related: The expert's verdict states that there is no evidence to support the claim that \"the state\" has instructed that anyone who didn't die from a gunshot wound or car accident be listed as a coronavirus victim. The expert mentions that they attempted to contact the user responsible for the claim but were unsuccessful in obtaining more information.", "Death certification process": "The expert explains that death certification in the United States is directed by federal guidelines through the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Medical examiners and coroners do not choose a \"default diagnosis\" such as COVID-19, but instead certify deaths based on investigations, autopsies, and medical tests as required.", "CDC guidance on COVID": "19 death certification: The expert mentions that the CDC offers guidance to public health officials on the certification of COVID-19 deaths. The latest guidance, issued on April 2, states that if COVID-19 played a role in the death, it should be specified on the death certificate. The guidance also highlights that COVID-19 can lead to various life-threatening conditions such as pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).", "Underestimation of the COVID": "19 death count: The expert states that many experts believe the number of deaths linked to COVID-19 in the U.S. is likely higher than the reported figures. This is attributed to factors such as an insufficient number of tests and inconsistent reporting across different locations. The expert suggests that the U.S. death count is probably underestimated rather than exaggerated."}
