{"The expert": "s statement that it was illegal for most black people in the history of the country to pass as white and that they would be put in jail if they tried to do so is an important aspect. This assertion by the expert highlights the historical context and legal consequences associated with passing as white for black individuals.", "The criticism unleashed by Dolezal": "s \"passing\" for black, which led to accusations that she used her racial identity as a tool for advancing her own goals, is another aspect that supports the claim. This criticism suggests that Dolezal's actions have diminished the real struggles of African-Americans by claiming to have experienced similar racism.", "The explanation of the": "one-drop rule\" and its implications for racial identity in the United States further supports the claim. This rule states that a person with any known African black ancestry is considered black, and thus, someone identifying as white could be accused of being black if evidence of a black ancestor emerged. This historical context adds weight to the expert's statement about the legal and social implications of passing as white for black individuals."}
