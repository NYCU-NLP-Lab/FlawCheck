{"Lack of documentation": "The expert's investigation revealed a lack of documentation to support the claim of a life expectancy of 58 for correctional officers. Despite efforts to find the supposed study conducted by Metropolitan Life in 1998, no evidence or data could be found.", "Inability to verify the source": "The expert's search for the source of the claim led to dead ends and inconsistencies. The supposed report from the New York State Council 80 of the American Federal of State, County and Municipal Employees could not be located, and the current union representing correctional officers in New York had no knowledge of it.", "Unreliable attribution": "The expert discovered that other instances of the claim being made attributed the research to different authors or websites, creating confusion and uncertainty about the validity of the information.", "Lack of data from reputable sources": "The expert's attempts to find data on life expectancies for various professions, specifically correctional officers, from reputable sources such as Metropolitan Life and the Society of Actuaries were unsuccessful. This raised doubts about the credibility of the claim."}
