{"Former state Sen": "Ted Lyon's claim: The first aspect employed to verify the authenticity of the claim is the actual statement made by former state Sen. Ted Lyon. He claimed that most schools in Texas spend 45 out of 180 school days in mandated testing.", "Lack of specific data": "The second aspect is the lack of specific data provided by Lyon to support his claim. The fact-checkers were unable to determine how Lyon arrived at the 45-day figure and he did not provide specific numbers or details about his sources.", "Interviews with education administrators": "The third aspect involved interviews conducted with current and former education administrators, mostly at the district level. These interviews aimed to gather information about the amount of time students spend in a testing mode for state-mandated tests.", "Increase in testing dates": "The fourth aspect involves the confirmation from the Texas Education Agency (TEA) spokeswoman, Debbie Ratcliffe, that the number of testing dates in Texas schools has increased over the years in response to state and federal mandates. This information supports the possibility that a significant amount of school days could be dedicated to testing."}
