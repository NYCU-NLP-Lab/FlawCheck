The lawsuit compared the state's voter file with death records and found more than 2,500 dead people, including one born in 1823, years before Michigan joined the Union.", "The fact that dead people are on the voter rolls does not mean that anyone has tried to cast a fraudulent ballot in their name": "4. The lawsuit was dropped months ago after elections officials took steps to clean up the voter rolls, indicating that efforts were made to address the issue."}
