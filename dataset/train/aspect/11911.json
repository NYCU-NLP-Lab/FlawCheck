{"Discrepancy in the timing": "The expert points out that the timing of the Facebook post allegedly made by Myeshia Johnson does not align with the reported time of President Trump's condolence call. This raises doubts about the authenticity of the screenshot.", "Corroboration by Rep": "Frederica Wilson: The expert mentions that Rep. Wilson, who was present during the phone call, supports Myeshia Johnson's account of the conversation. This adds credibility to the claim made by Johnson.", "Testimony of Sgt": "La David Johnson's mother: Cowanda Jones-Johnson, the mother of Sgt. La David Johnson, supports Rep. Wilson's version of events and claims that President Trump disrespected her son and family during the call. This further strengthens the authenticity of the claim.", "Lack of recorded evidence": "The expert states that the White House spokesperson confirmed that the call between President Trump and Myeshia Johnson was not recorded. Instead, Chief of Staff Gen. John Kelly and other White House staff members were present during the call and heard what was said. This absence of recorded evidence makes it challenging to verify the authenticity of the claim."}
