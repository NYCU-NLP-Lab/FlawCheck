{"Timing and source of the claim": "The claim was made by a new Twitter account that appeared on 8 August 2016, which quickly deleted the account. Screenshots of the alleged leaked medical records continued circulating on Twitter. The suspicious timing and source of the claim raise doubts about its authenticity.", "Discrepancies with real press reports": "The claim contradicts real press reports that mentioned Dr. Lisa Bardack, who attested to Clinton's medical fitness to serve as president. These reports stated that Clinton was in good health, diagnosed with only hypothyroidism and seasonal pollen allergies. The inconsistency between the claim and the actual press reports casts doubt on the authenticity of the leaked records.", "Obvious forgery indicators": "The leaked documents exhibit several obvious indicators of forgery. They do not resemble standard medical records, lack any form of letterhead, and do not include the doctor's signature. These discrepancies suggest that the person responsible for creating the leaked records did not have access to genuine documents and thus could not accurately imitate them.", "Formatting differences from verified document": "The leaked documents have noticeable formatting differences compared to an official letter issued by Dr. Bardack. For example, in the leaked documents, Bardack is listed as \"Chairman of the Department of Medicine, Mount Kisco Medical Group,\" while the verified document uses a different title for her. These formatting inconsistencies further raise suspicions about the authenticity of the claim."}
