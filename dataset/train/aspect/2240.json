{"The claim was verified by examining the credibility of the source": "The expert noted that Madhu Kishwar, who originally tweeted the claim, has a history of posting misinformation in the past. This raises doubts about the accuracy of the claim.", "The expert also considered the popularity and reach of the claim": "The tweet by Madhu Kishwar had been retweeted over 6000 times and liked over 8400 times, indicating that it had gained significant attention. However, the expert pointed out that popularity does not necessarily equate to accuracy.", "The expert analyzed the content of the claim itself": "They noted that the claim alleged that Y V Subba Reddy, Jagan Mohan Reddy's uncle, is a staunch evangelist and a Christian. However, the expert stated that Y V Subba Reddy's full name is Yarram Venkata Subba Reddy, not Yehova Vincent Subba Reddy as claimed. This discrepancy in the name raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "The expert also considered the context and background information related to the claim": "They mentioned that the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam (TTD) is an independent trust established for the management of the Tirumala Venkateshwara temple, and recently the Supreme Court had commented that Hindu temples should be managed by Hindus only. This context suggests that the appointment of a Christian chairman to the TTD board would be unlikely, further casting doubt on the claim's authenticity."}
