{"Hillary Clinton": "s claim that her proposals would \"not add a penny to the debt\" was contradicted by a nonpartisan budget watchdog group, which estimated that her proposals would add $200 billion to the debt over 10 years.", "The same budget experts estimated that Donald Trump": "s proposals would add significantly more to the debt - $5.3 trillion over 10 years. Clinton misleadingly claimed that Trump's tax cuts would \"add $20 trillion to the debt,\" without mentioning that it was a two-decade figure and didn't account for any spending cuts proposed by Trump.", "The budget estimates provided by the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget indicated that neither Clinton nor Trump fully paid for all of their initiatives": "While Clinton came closer to covering her spending proposals, she would still add well more than a penny to the debt based on what she had detailed thus far.", "The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget": "s analysis included rough and preliminary estimates of new policies announced by the candidates after their initial report in June. These estimates resulted in lower debt-increasing numbers for both Clinton and Trump compared to the earlier calculations."}
