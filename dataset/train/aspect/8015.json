This confirms that Ingenuity is part of the mission.", "Atmospheric conditions on Mars": "The expert's verdict explains that the claim disputes the ability of the Mars helicopter to fly due to alleged poor Martian atmospheric conditions. However, the expert refutes this by stating that atmospheric volume is not the main obstacle for flight, but rather atmospheric density. The expert provides information from a NASA engineer, confirming that atmospheric density is taken into account for flying the Ingenuity helicopter.", "Oxygen content in the Martian atmosphere": "The claim argues that combustion, necessary for rocket propulsion, cannot occur on Mars due to the low oxygen content in the Martian atmosphere. The expert's verdict counters this by stating that the Mars atmosphere contains 0.16% molecular oxygen, which is sufficient for combustion according to NASA."}
