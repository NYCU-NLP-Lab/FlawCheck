{"Sen": "Scott Jensen's claim on Fox News: Sen. Scott Jensen, a physician in Minnesota, made the claim on Fox News that hospitals get paid more if Medicare patients are listed as having COVID-19 and receive three times as much money if they require a ventilator. This claim was the initial source of the controversy.", "Publication in The Spectator and WorldNetDaily": "The claim was published in The Spectator, a conservative publication, on April 9. It was then shared by WorldNetDaily on April 10. These publications helped to spread the claim further and increase its visibility.", "Jensen": "s Facebook posts: Sen. Scott Jensen took to his own Facebook page on April 15 and April 19 to reiterate and clarify his assertion. In these posts, he explained the financial incentives for hospitals and the potential pressure from hospital administrators to list COVID-19 as a diagnosis on discharge papers or death certificates.", "Differences in state reporting guidelines": "Jensen highlighted the variations in state reporting guidelines for COVID-19 cases. Some states, like Minnesota and California, only list laboratory-confirmed cases, while others, like New York, include all presumed cases. These differences can impact the overall number of reported COVID-19 cases and potentially affect the financial allocations hospitals receive."}
