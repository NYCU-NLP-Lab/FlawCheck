{"The claim was debunked through a reverse image search of multiple keyframes from the video": "which revealed that the footage was actually filmed in a cemetery in the Tajikistan village of Shurkurgan, not in Thailand.", "A brief online report from Radio Free Europe": "Radio Liberty (RFERL) described how the graves in the Tajikistan cemetery collapsed after a river overflowed its banks and flooded the area, providing evidence that the video was related to natural causes rather than the rapture.", "Another video found using the Yandex search engine showed the aftermath of the destruction in Shurkurgan": "seemingly filmed through the perimeter wall, further confirming the location.", "The presence of a tall black mast in the footage": "matching part of a previous video, provided additional evidence that the video was indeed from the same location in Tajikistan."}
