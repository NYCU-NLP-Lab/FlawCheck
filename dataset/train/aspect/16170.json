{"Recirculation of a five": "year-old missing-person alert: The expert found that the claim about Allisyn Nicole being missing was a recirculation of a missing-person alert that was originally posted five years ago. This suggests that the claim is not current and may not be accurate.", "Multiple social media posts": "The expert found virtually identical posts on Twitter, Google Plus, Facebook, and Pinterest dating back to September 2013. These posts included photographs and captions about Allisyn Nicole being missing. The presence of multiple posts across different platforms raises questions about the authenticity of the claim.", "Inability to verify the claims": "The expert was unable to verify any of the claims made about Allisyn Nicole being missing. They found no entries in the U.S. Department of Justice's Amber Alerts database matching the name, and no press reports about a missing girl by that name between 2013 and the present. This lack of verification casts doubt on the authenticity of the claim.", "Unsuccessful search attempts": "The expert conducted reverse image searches and used a people-search engine but found no matches for the photograph or the name Allisyn Nicole. Additionally, a discussion on a television station's Facebook page did not provide any useful clues. These unsuccessful search attempts further undermine the credibility of the claim."}
