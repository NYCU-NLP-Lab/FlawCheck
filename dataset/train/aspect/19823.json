{"The original source of the claim": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim originated from a collage tweeted by a user named Prabhat Sharma. This tweet, along with its message, was retweeted over 1,000 times. Additionally, the claim was also shared on a Facebook group called Cricket Life, receiving over 500 shares. These sources provide the initial evidence for the claim.", "Visual evidence": "The expert's verdict highlights that the claim was supported by images of a crying photographer juxtaposed with a picture of Dhoni from the cricket world cup semi-finals. The collage was widely shared on social media platforms. This visual evidence is crucial in verifying the authenticity of the claim.", "Reverse image search": "The expert's verdict mentions that a reverse image search on Google revealed that the picture of the crying photographer was actually from January when an Iraqi photographer was in tears after his country lost against Qatar in the Asian Cup. This search provided evidence contradicting the claim and supports the conclusion that the claim is not authentic.", "Identification of the photographer": "The expert's verdict states that a report by Fox Sports identified the photographer in the original picture as Mohammed Al Assasawi. This identification further strengthens the evidence that the claim is not authentic since the photographer is not associated with the cricket world cup semi-finals but with a different event in January."}
