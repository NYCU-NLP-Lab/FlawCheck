{"Testimony from witnesses": "The expert's verdict mentions that the story is primarily based on the tellers' desire to believe it of Jane Fonda. This indicates that there may be witnesses who have shared their account of the incident.", "Verification from the restaurant": "The expert's verdict mentions that the folks at Sir Scott's Oasis Steakhouse in Manhattan, Montana, where most versions of the email claim the incident occurred, have stated that Jane Fonda had been in their restaurant. This serves as a direct verification from the restaurant itself.", "Fonda": "s own statement: The expert's verdict cites a statement made by Jane Fonda in 1994 where she recommended using the crying game tactic if someone is not getting served or cannot get what they need. This statement contradicts the claim and suggests that Fonda may not have played the \"Do you know who I am?\" card in the restaurant.", "Lack of substantial evidence": "The expert's verdict mentions that there is not much support for the story other than the desire to believe it of Jane Fonda. This suggests that there is a lack of substantial evidence or proof to verify the authenticity of the claim."}
