{"Lack of credible source": "The expert's verdict highlights that the claim attributes the quote to the Beijing Daily Express, a publication that has no record. This raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim as it lacks a reliable and credible source.", "Limited scope of evidence": "The Chinese Yutu moon rover, which allegedly found no evidence of American moon landings, only took photos in its limited range of up to 10 kilometers. This limited scope of evidence makes it difficult to draw a definitive conclusion about the presence or absence of moon landings.", "Inadequate proximity to Apollo landing sites": "The expert points out that the Chinese moon rover, Yutu, landed far from the Apollo landing site. It would have required extensive travel over thousands of kilometers to visit all the Apollo landing sites. Therefore, the rover's lack of evidence cannot be considered conclusive due to its significant distance from the alleged landing sites.", "Existence of alternative evidence": "The Lunar Reconnaissance Spacecraft, operated by the Chinese space agency, has captured ample evidence of the Apollo landing, which can be accessed in a database. Additionally, the Apollo mission brought back rock samples that are available upon request from NASA. These alternative sources of evidence contradict the claim and support the authenticity of the American moon landings."}
