{"The expert": "s verdict highlights that there is no evidence of an administration official making a public pledge to keep unemployment below 8 percent. This suggests that the claim made by Gov. Chris Christie is not supported by any official statements or promises from the Obama administration.", "The expert also mentions that similar claims have been debunked before by PolitiFact National and its state affiliates": "This indicates that the claim made by Gov. Chris Christie is not a new or unique allegation, but rather a recurring talking point used by Republicans.", "The expert points out that the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009": "commonly known as the stimulus plan, was signed into law on February 17, 2009. This information provides context for the claim and highlights the timing of the stimulus plan in relation to the unemployment rate.", "The expert mentions that the nation": "s unemployment rate stood at 8.3 percent in February 2009 and gradually increased before peaking at 10 percent in October 2009. This data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics contradicts the claim made by Gov. Chris Christie, as it shows that the unemployment rate did indeed go above 8 percent after the stimulus plan was passed."}
