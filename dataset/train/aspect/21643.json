{"The claim is based on a U": "S. Census Bureau survey released in 2011, which found that women's total wages were about 23 percent lower than men's total wages. However, this study did not specifically examine equal pay for the same work or the same number of hours worked.", "Other data": "such as hourly wages tracked by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and data comparing the same jobs, show smaller wage gaps. This suggests that the claim may not accurately represent the overall situation.", "The claim does not take into account critical factors that could influence the wage gap": "such as specific occupation, time on the job, and education level. When comparing men and women with similar education levels, job titles, time on the job, and other relevant factors, the wage gap significantly decreases.", "Economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of St": "Louis referenced a survey prepared for the Labor Department, which found that when differences in factors like education and job characteristics are accounted for, much of the hourly wage gap disappears and shrinks to low single digits. This indicates that the claim may oversimplify the complexities of the gender pay gap."}
