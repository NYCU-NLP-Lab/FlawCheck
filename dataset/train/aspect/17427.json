{"The claim originated from a post shared on Facebook in November 2018": "which stated that Starbucks COO Rosalind Brewer once expressed the viewpoint that \"white men are the root of all evil.\"", "The claim was further spread through a link shared on the": "Tiger Droppings\" web forum, which led to an article on NewsPunch (formerly known as Your News Wire), a notorious junk news source.", "The original article on NewsPunch": "published in February 2018, was the primary source for the claim that circulated on Facebook months later. It quoted a 2015 CNN interview with Rosalind Brewer, then CEO of Sam's Club, where she discussed diversity in her executive team and her efforts to promote gender equality.", "The Your News Wire article": "as well as subsequent sources like SilenceIsConsent.net and The Washington Post, presented a distorted and sensationalized version of Brewer's statements, suggesting that she believed \"white men are the root of all evil.\" However, a careful examination of the original interview shows that Brewer was discussing the importance of diversity and gender equality in corporate America, rather than making a blanket statement about white men."}
