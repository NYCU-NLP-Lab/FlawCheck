{"The claim is based on the": "Medicare for All\" transition plan proposed by Senator Elizabeth Warren, which identifies two legal mechanisms that could be used to reduce drug prices: \"compulsory licensing\" outlined in 28 U.S. Code Section 1498 and the \"march-in rights\" provision of the 1980 Bayh-Dole Act.", "Legal and pharmaceutical policy experts confirm that these mechanisms can indeed be employed to bring down drug prices": "but it is a complicated and controversial process.", "The government has the authority to intervene and take over patents without the company": "s permission if the price of a drug is deemed too high. This allows the government to create competition by importing the products from abroad or manufacturing them domestically.", "While the use of these mechanisms may not apply to all drugs": "specific patented drugs like insulin and EpiPens, which are more affordable in other countries, would qualify. This could also serve as a message to other drug manufacturers."}
