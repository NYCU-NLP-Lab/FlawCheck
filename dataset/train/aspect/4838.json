{"Lack of documents": "The AYUSH ministry stated that Patanjali Ayurved was asked not to advertise Coronil as a cure for COVID-19 due to the lack of documents or proof of efficacy.", "Research articles": "Patanjali released two research articles as proof of efficacy for the Coronil kit. However, these studies were not published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) as claimed by Patanjali.", "Limited studies": "The two research studies provided by Patanjali were related to only one component of the Coronil tablet (Giloy) and tablet 1 (DRS). No studies were provided for the other components (Ashwagandha, Tulsi) or the third drug in the kit (Anu Taila).", "Clinical Trial Registry of India": "CTRI): The CTRI document suggested that 120 COVID-19 infected patients received Coronil treatment and were successfully cured at a rate of 100%. However, the CTRI document only serves as proof of registration and not as a published RCT study."}
