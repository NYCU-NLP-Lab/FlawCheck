{"The expert clarifies that the claim of 132": "000 ballots being \"highly likely\" to be ineligible in Fulton County, Georgia, is based on a misinterpretation of a statement made by Richard Baris, director of Big Data Polling. Baris explained that the 132,000 flags indicating a change of address in the voter files did not imply illegal voting.", "The expert highlights that the claim was spread on social media without verifying the context or reaching out to Baris for clarification": "This lack of fact-checking led to the misinformation being widely shared.", "The expert points out that if such a significant number of ballots were indeed disqualified in Fulton County": "it would have been a major news story and election officials would have made public statements about it. However, no such reports or statements have been made.", "The expert mentions that the claim originated in the aftermath of the 2020 U": "S. presidential election, in which Georgia flipped to Democratic President-elect Joe Biden. The claim could potentially be seen as an attempt to undermine the election results as Trump's team had requested a recount in Georgia."}
