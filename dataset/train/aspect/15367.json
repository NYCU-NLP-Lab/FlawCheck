{"The claim that gas cylinders have expiry dates printed on them was dismissed by the Indian Oil Corporation": "stating that there is no expiry date for LPG cylinders. They clarified that the term \"expiry\" is typically used for perishable products and does not apply to gas cylinders.", "A news report from an Indian publication in 2017 described the claim as one that recurs annually in the country": "indicating that it is a recurring misinformation.", "Michael Wasike": "an engineer at Chemigas, a gas plant in Nairobi, explained that gas cylinders undergo periodic inspections to ensure they adhere to safety standards. In Kenya, cylinders are supposed to be used in the market for eight years before undergoing fresh inspections.", "David Tyler": "the director of the World Liquefied Petroleum Gas Association, stated that during inspections, gas cylinders undergo visual checks for dents and corrosion, date checks to ensure they are not due for requalification, and tare weight checks to ensure the correct amount of LPG is filled into the cylinder. These inspections do not indicate expiry dates but rather the next due date for testing or inspection."}
