{"Prime Minister Narendra Modi": "s own statement: In the interview transcript, Modi explicitly states that he is not an educated person and left home after completing schooling, indicating that he did not study beyond 10th standard.", "Confirmation from the reporter": "The reporter asks Modi about his educational background, specifically questioning if he studied only till primary school. Modi confirms that he studied till high school, further supporting the claim.", "Social media circulation": "The claim has been circulating widely on social media platforms for at least three years, with various individuals and groups sharing the video clip. The viral nature of the claim adds to the authenticity of the statement made by Modi.", "External examinations and degrees": "However, it is important to note that Modi mentions in the interview that he pursued external exams to obtain a BA and MA degree from Delhi University. This aspect provides a contrasting perspective and suggests that Modi did pursue higher education through alternative means, potentially contradicting the initial claim."}
