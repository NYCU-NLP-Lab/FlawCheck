{"The claim was made by U": "S. Rep. Frank Wolf during a speech on the House floor.", "The claim is based on a report from the Congressional Budget Office": "CBO) from June 2011.", "The CBO report projects that by 2025": "payments for Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare, and debt interest will exceed all federal revenues going into the budget.", "The CBO report presents two scenarios": "one assuming current policies continue indefinitely and another assuming laws on the books in June 2011 take effect. The bleakest scenario, which Wolf focuses on, shows exhausted revenues, while the more optimistic scenario shows revenues staying above the costs of entitlement programs and interest payments on the national debt."}
