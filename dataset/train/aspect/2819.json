{"Attorney General Sessions cited a longstanding policy of the Department of Justice not to comment on conversations with the president as the reason for his refusal to answer questions": "2. The Justice Department provided two memos from 1982 and 2009 that discussed executive privilege but did not explicitly state that the attorney general should not comment on conversations with the president.", "The memos acknowledged the expectation of confidentiality for executive branch communications and advised the attorney general to consult with the White House counsel regarding congressional information requests": "4. Sessions stated that he didn't want to answer certain questions without first giving President Trump the opportunity to decide whether to share the information with Congress or keep it confidential, which aligns with the rationale of the memos."}
