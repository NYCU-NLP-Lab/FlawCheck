{"The claim made by Texas Sen": "Ted Cruz at Liberty University that \"roughly half of born-again Christians aren't voting\" is the central focus of the expert's verdict.", "The expert mentions that in the 2012 presidential race": "born-again Christians accounted for 26 percent of all voters, with most of them voting for GOP nominee Mitt Romney, according to exit polls commissioned by news organizations.", "The expert highlights the decline in the share of white Christian voters over the years": "with 75 percent identifying as such in 1992 compared to 57 percent in 2012. This decline is attributed to increasing ethnic diversity and a decrease in young Americans affiliating with a religion.", "The expert raises the question of whether Cruz": "s claim specifically refers to white evangelical Protestants or all born-again Christians, considering that many African Americans, who tend to vote Democratic, also identify as born-again Christians. The expert suggests that Cruz's claim may be more applicable to white evangelical Protestants rather than the entire born-again Christian population."}
