{"The unemployment rate in August was 4": "4 percent, which is not the lowest level in 16 years as claimed by President Trump. The rate briefly hit the same level in 2006 and 2007, and to find a lower rate, one would need to go back to early 2001.", "The unemployment rate has been steadily declining since its peak in October 2009 during the Great Recession": "which indicates that the trend predates Trump's presidency.", "While total nonfarm employment reached a record high in August": "it should be noted that the U.S. population is constantly increasing, and there have been multiple instances in history where \"more people working\" has been achieved.", "Job gains under Trump have been fewer compared to the same time frame in each of the previous four years": "indicating that the claim of unprecedented job growth is not accurate. The U.S. has been consistently adding jobs every month since early 2010, regardless of the presidential administration."}
