{"Verification of the photo": "The expert examined the photo in question and determined that it did not show Kamala Harris with her parents. They identified the individuals in the photo as Suneil and Rohini Parulekar, who confirmed their identity in an interview with PolitiFact.", "Confirmation from the Parulekars": "The expert obtained confirmation from the Parulekars themselves that they were the couple in the photo and not Kamala Harris's parents. Suneil Parulekar explicitly stated that they are not Harris's parents.", "Historical context": "The expert provided information about the timing of the photo, stating that it was taken four years ago when Harris was California attorney general. This context helps to establish that the photo does not represent Harris with her parents.", "Genetic ancestry clarification": "The expert addressed the misleading implication in the claim that Harris cannot have African ancestry because her father is Jamaican. They cited a census and genetic studies to highlight that the majority of Jamaicans have sub-Saharan African ancestry, debunking the claim's flawed reasoning."}
