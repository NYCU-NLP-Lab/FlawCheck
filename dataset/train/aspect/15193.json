{"Timing": "The expert points out that Trump's statement about recommending Ohio as the convention city seems odd because the site selection committee had already made their decision in July 2014, before Trump was even a candidate. This raises doubts about the accuracy of Trump's claim.", "Lack of evidence": "The expert mentions that they searched for any evidence or statements from Trump regarding the selection of Cleveland as the convention city but found none. This lack of evidence undermines the authenticity of Trump's claim.", "Testimony of committee member": "The expert spoke to Steve Duprey, a member of the site selection committee, who stated that he does not recall Trump's name being mentioned in any of the committee meetings. This testimony contradicts Trump's claim and adds to the skepticism surrounding it.", "Absence from convention coverage": "The expert notes that during the convention coverage, there were no mentions or sightings of Trump in relation to the selection of Cleveland as the convention city. Instead, there were articles about the closure of Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City. This absence further casts doubt on the veracity of Trump's claim."}
