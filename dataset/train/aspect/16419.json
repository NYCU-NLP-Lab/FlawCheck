{"Lack of evidence from a specific poll": "The expert mentions that they emailed the White House to provide the poll that President Trump relied on for his claim, but they did not receive a response. This lack of evidence raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Polling data from reputable sources": "The expert points out that the highest approval rating among Republican voters for President Trump is 87% from Gallup, with CNN coming in second at 86%. These numbers are significantly lower than the 90%-94% approval rating claimed by President Trump, indicating that his statement may not be accurate.", "Comparison with previous presidents": "The expert compares President Trump's approval rating among Republican voters to that of previous presidents at a similar point in their tenure. They highlight that George W. Bush had a 94% approval rating within his party, while Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon had lower ratings. This comparison suggests that President Trump's claim of having the highest approval rating in Republican Party history may not be accurate.", "Lack of historical data": "The expert mentions that President Trump previously claimed to have the highest polling numbers in the history of the Republican Party, including surpassing Abraham Lincoln and Ronald Reagan. However, the expert states that this claim is false because there is no data available from Lincoln's time. This lack of historical data undermines the credibility of President Trump's claim."}
