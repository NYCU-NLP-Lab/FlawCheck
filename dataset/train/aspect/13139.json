{"The images used to support the claim were analyzed and found to be fake": "The Washington Times did not publish a headline declaring \"President Gore\" after the 2000 election.", "The authenticity of the images was verified by comparing them to an actual copy of The Washington Times": "front page from November 8, 2000, which showed that the newspaper had declared George W. Bush as the winner of the election.", "The origins of the fake": "President Gore\" images were traced back to at least 2010 when they were posted on Deviant Art by a user named \"Emperor Norton I.\" This suggests that the images were created as a work of fiction and not based on any actual newspaper publication.", "The claim made by Tim Murtaugh": "the communications director for President Trump's re-election campaign, that the images were a reminder that \"the media doesn't select the President\" was found to be accurate. However, it was noted that this claim contradicted President Trump's prior assertion that the election must be called on election night, which was debunked by news outlets."}
