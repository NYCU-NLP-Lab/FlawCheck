{"The video footage of the alleged strange noises coming from the grave of a Pakistani cleric had been widely shared online before the cleric": "s murder and burial, suggesting that it may not be directly related to his grave.", "The video was initially shared on Twitter on October 15 with a caption in Arabic mentioning that the noises were heard while digging for gold": "indicating that the origin of the footage may not be connected to the cleric's grave.", "The video was also posted on Facebook on October 21 and YouTube on October 25": "with varying captions claiming different locations for the footage, including Iran. This inconsistency raises doubts about the authenticity and origin of the video.", "The viral video was made to appear as a breaking news report from ARY": "a private Pakistani news television channel. However, the static ARY logo in the video contradicts the animated logo used in their actual broadcasts, as confirmed by the Islamabad Bureau Chief for ARY news.
