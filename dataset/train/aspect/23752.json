{"Lack of representative sample": "The expert mentioned that it is difficult to determine the accurate percentage of women who have been sexually abused or assaulted during their journey to the United States because there is no single representative sample of all the women who cross Mexico.", "Limited data": "The overall data on the number of women abused or assaulted during the journey is limited. Not all women making the journey are interviewed, and not all cases of abuse are reported, making it challenging to obtain comprehensive and reliable statistics.", "Higher percentages reported by advocates": "The expert mentioned that immigrant and refugee advocates have reported higher percentages of women being abused or assaulted during their journey. However, these figures are not based on a representative sample of all women who cross Mexico.", "Doctors Without Borders report": "The expert referred to a report from Doctors Without Borders, which surveyed over 400 people in Mexico at facilities that assist migrants. The report stated that 31.4 percent of women surveyed had been sexually abused during their transit through Mexico. However, it is important to note that the majority of those interviewed were men, indicating that the sample may not fully represent all women making the journey."}
