{"The claim states that Julie Lassa pushed for a": "Canadian-style government takeover of health care.\" Experts have verified that the Healthy Wisconsin plan, which Lassa supported, was not a single payer plan like the Canadian system. Instead, it aimed to provide health insurance to all eligible Wisconsin residents through a variety of private insurance plans.", "The experts also confirmed that the Healthy Wisconsin plan would have been funded through a payroll tax on both employers and workers": "rather than an income tax. This differs from the Canadian system, which primarily relies on income taxes to fund healthcare.", "Another aspect that was employed to verify the claim": "s authenticity is that under the Healthy Wisconsin plan, individuals, not employers, would have the freedom to choose their health plan from a range of options. This contrasts with the Canadian system, where healthcare is provided by the government and individuals have limited choice in their coverage.", "Furthermore": "the experts pointed out that the Healthy Wisconsin plan would have regulated private insurance plans by the state. This means that private insurance would have continued to exist alongside the government-provided coverage, unlike the Canadian system where private insurance is limited."}
