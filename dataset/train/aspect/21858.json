{"The statement made by the World Health Organization": "WHO) scientist regarding asymptomatic transmission being \"very rare\" was found to be problematic and confusing by many scientists.", "It is well documented that people without symptoms can transmit the virus": "but the frequency and extent of asymptomatic transmission are still unknown.", "The WHO scientist clarified that her original comment applied to a subset of studies and data and pertained only to those who are truly asymptomatic": "not including those who are pre-symptomatic or have mild symptoms.", "While there is substantial evidence that people without symptoms can spread the disease": "the exact proportion of spread from pre-symptomatic individuals versus those who never develop symptoms is still unclear."}
