{"Analysis of adverse events data": "The expert likely examined data related to adverse events reported after both coronavirus and flu vaccinations. By comparing the number of adverse events reported for each type of vaccination, they were able to determine if the claim of coronavirus vaccinations causing 50 times more adverse events than flu vaccinations was accurate.", "Review of scientific studies": "The expert may have reviewed relevant scientific studies to gather evidence on the adverse events associated with both coronavirus and flu vaccinations. They would have analyzed the findings of these studies to determine if the claim aligns with the existing research on vaccine side effects.", "Comparison of vaccine composition and mechanisms": "The expert might have compared the composition and mechanisms of coronavirus and flu vaccines to understand if there are any inherent differences that could contribute to varying levels of adverse events. They would have assessed factors such as the type of vaccine (mRNA, viral vector, inactivated), the specific antigens targeted, and the immune response elicited by each vaccine.", "Consultation with other experts": "The expert might have sought the opinions and insights of other professionals in the field, such as immunologists or vaccine researchers, to validate the claim. By engaging in discussions and exchanging knowledge with peers, they would have been able to gain a broader perspective and ensure the accuracy of their verdict."}
