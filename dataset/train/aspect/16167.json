{"David Perdue": "s leadership role at three firms - Sara Lee, Haggar Clothing Co., and Pillowtex - was cited as evidence of his efforts to ship jobs overseas. The claim is supported by Perdue's senior vice president position at Sara Lee, where he was sent to Hong Kong to increase manufacturing and contracts in the region.", "The major restructuring announced by Sara Lee in 1994": "during Perdue's final year with the company, resulted in the elimination of 8,000 to 9,000 jobs worldwide. This included the closure of four Georgia plants and the loss of 540 jobs. While the breakdown of jobs lost at overseas plants is not specified, a statement from Sara Lee indicated that most of those jobs were at European operations.", "During Perdue": "s tenure as senior vice president at Haggar Clothing Co. from 1994 to 1998, there was a loss of about 1,950 domestic jobs according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings. Domestic manufacturing also dropped from 29 percent to 12 percent of operations. While it is acknowledged that production was shifted overseas, the impact on domestic employment is debated.", "The claim is further supported by the statement from Perdue": "s spokesman, Michael Smith, who described Perdue's management style as looking to manufacture goods abroad instead of in the United States. This assertion suggests a consistent pattern throughout Perdue's career as an executive."}
