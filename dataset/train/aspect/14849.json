{"Apple": "s claim of being \"90 percent conflict-free\" is inaccurate. The expert's verdict states that while Apple is commended for its transparency and efforts to ensure conflict-free sourcing, it reported that only 88 percent of its smelters and refineries were verified as conflict-free or participating in third-party auditing programs in 2014. It is unclear what the current percentage is.", "Intel": "s claim of being \"100 percent conflict-free\" is also inaccurate. The expert's verdict mentions that Intel stated 100 percent of its microprocessors and chipsets were conflict-free in 2014, but it couldn't determine if the label applied to other products. In 2015, about 78 percent of Intel's smelters and refineries were deemed conflict-free. It is uncertain if Intel has achieved a 100 percent conflict-free status for all its products.", "Ensuring a 100 percent conflict": "free global supply chain is nearly impossible. The expert's verdict highlights the opinion of Laura Seay, a professor who studies the African Great Lakes, and Carly Oboth, a policy adviser for the NGO Global Witness. They both state that achieving complete conflict-free status is hypothetical and aspirational, and there are ongoing challenges and risks in the auditing process.", "Conflict": "free labeling does not guarantee the absence of abuse or human rights violations. The expert's verdict mentions that the narrow focus of Dodd-Frank, the legislation that requires conflict mineral reporting, means that conflict-free is not synonymous with abuse-free. Instances of child labor and funding of armed groups have been documented in the production of minerals not designated as conflict minerals. This raises questions about the effectiveness of conflict-free labeling in curbing violence and protecting human rights."}
