{"The ad claims that Jason Carter": "actually opposed more funding for education in the Senate.\" This claim is supported by the fact that Carter voted \"No\" on the 2015 state budget, which included austerity cuts to education amounting to $747 million.", "The ad highlights that out of 56 state senators": "Carter was one of only four who voted against the budget, as shown by state records.", "Carter": "s opposition to the budget is explained by his belief that a separate education budget would restore all previous cuts, rather than just some. He argued that the budget reflected Governor Deal's lack of value for students, teachers, and classrooms.", "The ad also mentions Carter": "s proposal for a separate education budget and a questionable funding stream from tax cheats to boost spending. This suggests that Carter has further plans to address education funding beyond his opposition to the 2015 budget."}
