{"Historical accounts and documentation": "The expert mentions a specific example from 1996 (de Vos, 1996) that supports the claim. This indicates that there is historical evidence or documentation that mentions the story of a stranger selling the idea to bottle Coca-Cola.", "Personal memories and testimonies": "The expert refers to Sam Dobbs, the nephew of Asa Candler, who recalls a dispute over the idea of selling Coke in bottled form near its 1885 debut. This suggests that there are personal memories and testimonies from individuals involved in the early days of Coca-Cola that support the claim.", "Business considerations and objections": "The expert explains that Asa Candler, the owner of Coca-Cola at the time, had concerns about unsanitary bottling conditions and the potential damage to the product's reputation. This indicates that there were legitimate business considerations and objections to implementing the idea of bottling Coca-Cola.", "Delayed implementation of the suggestion": "The expert mentions that Asa Candler chose not to immediately implement the idea of bottling Coca-Cola, which may have contributed to the belief in the legend of a stranger selling the idea. This suggests that there is evidence of a delayed implementation of the suggestion, supporting the claim that the idea was not immediately acted upon."}
