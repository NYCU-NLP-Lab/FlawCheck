{"The claim is supported by data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics": "Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS), which reported 6,044,000 job openings in April 2017, the highest number since 2000.", "The rate of job openings": "adjusted for the size of the U.S. population, also reached a record level in April 2017, indicating a significant number of available jobs.", "Economists agree that a skills gap is a contributing factor to some job vacancies": "as stated by Ivanka Trump. However, they caution against oversimplifying the issue by attributing all 6 million job openings solely to the skills gap.", "While some job vacancies require specific skills or qualifications": "many can be filled through on-the-job training and experience, suggesting that the lack of a college degree or specialized training may not always be the primary barrier to employment."}
