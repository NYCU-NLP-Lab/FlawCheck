{"Lack of evidence": "The expert points out that there is zero evidence to support the claim that thieves select homes to break into after Christmas by taking note of boxes curbed as trash or recycling. This lack of evidence undermines the authenticity of the claim.", "Widespread circulation of the claim": "The expert mentions that the claim was widely circulated on Facebook after December 25, 2016, with many warnings encouraging people to disguise their Christmas refuse. The fact that the claim spread rapidly and gained popularity does not necessarily make it true.", "Inclusion in official advice posts": "Police departments and municipal agencies included the tip in their holiday advice posts. However, the expert notes that these agencies are known to occasionally give shaky advice on social media, suggesting that their inclusion of the tip does not necessarily validate its authenticity.", "Lack of correlation with actual incidents": "The expert highlights that incidents of gift-grabbing robberies reported in December 2016 did not appear to involve thieves targeting homes based on trash-casing. The victims were selected at random, indicating that rearranging garbage or disposing of boxes differently would not have spared them. This lack of correlation between the claim and actual incidents weakens its credibility."}
