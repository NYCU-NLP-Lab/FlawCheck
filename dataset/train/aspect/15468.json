{"The claim originated from a tweet by a user who describes himself as": "very left\" and has a history of sharing politically biased content.", "The German government itself has not taken the position of requesting the removal of the American ambassador": "Richard Grenell. It was a member of the opposition party in the German Parliament who called for considering Grenell \"persona non grata.\"", "The reason for the opposition party": "s criticism of Grenell was his comments on Germany's defense spending plans, not because they believe he stokes racism and fascism.", "Grenell has previously sparked controversy with his statements": "such as expressing a desire to \"empower other conservatives throughout Europe,\" which led to rebukes from German politicians. However, he has remained in his position as the American ambassador to Germany."}
