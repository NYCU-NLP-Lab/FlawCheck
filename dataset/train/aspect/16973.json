{"The reduction in territory controlled by the Islamic State": "The expert's verdict mentions that data from IHS Markit, a private defense and security research firm, shows a 93 percent reduction in territory controlled by the Islamic State from January 2015 to January 2018. This aspect verifies the claim that significant progress has been made in liberating territory from the Islamic State.", "Time frame and recent territorial losses": "The expert's verdict highlights that President Trump emphasized the one-year time frame and territory \"just recently held\" by the Islamic State. While the claim suggests that almost 100 percent of the territory has been liberated, the expert notes that if this refers to the time since Trump took office, the losses are closer to 89 percent. This aspect provides context and clarifies the timeframe in which the territorial losses occurred.", "Continuity and contributions from previous administrations": "The expert's verdict mentions that the success described by Trump built upon strategy and attacks launched under President Obama. The campaign to defeat ISIS began in September 2014, and the expert notes that a significant portion of the action and airstrikes took place during the Obama years. This aspect highlights the continuity of efforts across different administrations in the fight against ISIS.", "Tactical changes and accelerated operations": "The expert's verdict includes a statement from a terrorism expert, Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, who explains that Trump devolved more authority to the tactical level on the battlefield. This change in strategy reportedly sped up U.S. operations and contributed to the collapse of ISIS in mid-2017. This aspect suggests that Trump's approach and decision-making played a role in accelerating the progress against ISIS."}
