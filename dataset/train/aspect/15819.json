{"The source of the claim": "The expert's verdict highlights that the claim originated from the World News Daily Report (WNDR) website, which is known for publishing fictional and entertainment content. The source's reputation for producing junk news raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Lack of credible evidence": "The expert's verdict mentions that the WNDR article included photographs that were unrelated to the fabricated arrest of the babysitter. One image was a mugshot from a 2015 arrest at a strip club in Houston, while the other image depicted police officers from a New York Times article about a shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando. This lack of relevant and credible evidence casts doubt on the truthfulness of the claim.", "Disclaimer on the website": "The expert's verdict points out that the WNDR website itself includes a disclaimer stating that its content is entirely fictional and any resemblance to real people or incidents is purely coincidental. This disclaimer further undermines the authenticity of the claim.", "Inconsistencies in the story": "The expert's verdict highlights several inconsistencies within the claim. For instance, the claim states that the parents contacted the Orlando Police Department, but it does not provide any details or official reports to support this. Such inconsistencies raise suspicions about the accuracy of the claim."}
