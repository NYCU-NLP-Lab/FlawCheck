{"Outdated figure": "The expert's verdict highlights that Education Secretary Betsy DeVos used an outdated figure when claiming that only 10% of school districts provided any real curriculum and instruction program. The expert states that this figure was accurate for 82 districts in late March, but by late April, 56% were doing so, and by late May, the figure was 67%.", "Non": "representative sample: The expert points out that the 82 districts mentioned in the claim were not a nationally representative sample. Another analysis conducted by the same organization, which included a statistically representative sample of U.S. school districts, found that 33.5% expected all teachers to provide remote instruction, and another 13.2% expected some teachers to do so.", "Center on Reinventing Public Education": "The expert mentions that the claim was based on information from the Center on Reinventing Public Education, which is a nonpartisan research center housed at the University of Washington Bothell. They state that the center is open to all possible solutions to improve outcomes for all students and that parent choice is essential but not magic.", "Context of the claim": "The expert provides context by stating that DeVos made the claim during a July 8 coronavirus task force briefing, where she spoke about reopening schools in the fall. The expert includes quotes from DeVos where she acknowledges that some schools and districts did well in transitioning to remote learning, while others did not. DeVos refers to the Center for Reinventing Public Education's claim to support her argument."}
