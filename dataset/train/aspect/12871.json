{"Balanced budget": "The claim states that Nathan McMurray has kept a balanced budget as a small-town supervisor. The expert verifies this by examining the town's financial statements, which show that the town's revenues and expenditures were in balance in both 2016 and 2017, meeting the requirement set by the New York State Comptroller's Office.", "Increased surpluses": "McMurray claims to have increased surpluses during his tenure. The expert confirms this by analyzing the town's \"unassigned fund balance,\" which is considered the surplus in town government. The unassigned fund balance increased from $5.9 million in 2015 (before McMurray took office) to $6.8 million in 2016 and $6.7 million in 2017.", "Highest credit rating": "McMurray asserts that he led the town to its highest credit rating ever. The expert supports this claim by stating that Grand Island received its highest credit rating since at least 2001 in September 2016. The town's bond rating improved from A2 to Aa1, which is the second-highest rating on Moody's scale.", "Leadership and accomplishments": "McMurray emphasizes his role as a small-town supervisor, an Eagle Scout, and a family man. While not directly verified by the expert, these aspects provide additional context and personal attributes of McMurray that may influence voters' perceptions."}
