{"Video evidence": "The expert analyzed the video clip that was shared on social media to verify the claim. They observed the actions and statements of the individuals in the video to determine if the Abu Dhabi crown prince was chanting 'Jai Siya Ram' and if a Muslim lady was carrying the Ramayana on her head.", "Social media sharing": "The expert noted that the video was widely shared on social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook. They examined the accompanying narratives and hashtags used in the posts to understand the claims being made.", "Source credibility": "The expert investigated the source of the claim, which was a tweet by a user named Geetika Swami. They noted that Geetika Swami is followed on Twitter by the office of Nirmala Sitharaman, which could indicate a level of credibility. However, they also considered that the tweet had been retweeted over 750 times, which could contribute to the spread of misinformation.", "Historical context": "The expert analyzed the historical context of the video, noting that it was from September 2016 and not a recent event. They also mentioned that the same video had been shared earlier in 2019 with a false narrative about the Sultan's wife carrying the Ramayana towards the first Hindu temple in Abu Dhabi. This information helped establish that the claim was not authentic."}
