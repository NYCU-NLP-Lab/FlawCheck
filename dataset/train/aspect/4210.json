{"Announcement by Ugandan government minister": "The expert's verdict mentions that in October 2019, Uganda's Minister for Ethics and Integrity, Simon Lokodo, announced the intention to revive a bill that would make \"grave acts\" of homosexuality punishable by death. This announcement serves as evidence supporting the claim.", "Funding by the National Christian Foundation": "The expert's verdict states that the National Christian Foundation has funded projects opposing LGBT rights in Uganda. This funding provides a connection between the National Christian Foundation and efforts related to the death penalty for homosexuality, supporting the claim.", "Funding by the WinShape Foundation": "According to the expert's verdict, the WinShape Foundation, closely linked to Chick-fil-A, has funded the National Christian Foundation. This financial connection between Chick-fil-A and the National Christian Foundation strengthens the claim.", "Contradiction and lack of clarity": "The expert's verdict mentions that the Ugandan minister's remarks were quickly contradicted by the government, and it's not clear to what extent National Christian Foundation-funded entities were involved in the creation or promotion of the bill. These aspects highlight limitations and uncertainties in verifying the claim's authenticity."}
