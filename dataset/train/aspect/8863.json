{"Greta Van Susteren wrongly claimed that U": "S. Secretary of State John Kerry met with Hamas officials in Paris on July 26 to discuss a possible ceasefire in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.", "No meeting between Kerry and Hamas officials took place": "as no American official is allowed to negotiate with Hamas due to its designation as a terrorist organization by the United States.", "Van Susteren later acknowledged her error on Twitter and clarified that Kerry talked to Turkey and Qatar about Hamas in Paris": "not directly with Hamas officials.", "While Kerry did meet with the foreign ministers of Turkey and Qatar": "who are major international backers of Hamas, the claim that the Arab League was unhappy with Kerry's talks with these countries is an oversimplification. The Arab League, composed of 21 member states, has not issued any group statement condemning or criticizing Kerry's meeting."}
