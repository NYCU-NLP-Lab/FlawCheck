{"Comparison of tax burden percentages": "The expert analyzed the claim by comparing the tax burden percentages under Rudy Giuliani, Mike Huckabee, and Mitt Romney. The campaign provided data stating that Giuliani reduced New Yorkers' tax burden by nearly 20 percent, while Huckabee and Romney saw increases in their respective states. The Tax Foundation also provided slightly lower figures for the increases under Huckabee and Romney.", "Use of the Tax Foundation": "s method: The Giuliani campaign based their numbers on the Tax Foundation's method of calculating the percentage of state income taken in state tax. However, it should be noted that the Tax Foundation does not calculate these figures for cities, so the Giuliani campaign's claim of a 20 percent decrease in tax burden for New York City was their own calculation.", "Consideration of local taxes": "The expert highlighted that the statewide tax burden calculated by the Tax Foundation includes local taxes that a governor does not control. This means that the tax burden figures may not fully reflect the impact of a governor's policies on overall tax relief.", "Contextual factors": "The expert mentioned that tax burden numbers alone do not tell the whole story. Each governor faced different situations and challenges, such as court orders or legislative constraints, which influenced their ability to implement tax cuts. For example, Huckabee faced a court order to increase education spending in Arkansas, while Romney struggled to decrease the income tax rate in Massachusetts due to opposition from the Democrat-controlled legislature. These contextual factors need to be considered when evaluating the claim."}
