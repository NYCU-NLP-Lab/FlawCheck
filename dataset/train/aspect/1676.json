{"Video evidence": "The expert's verdict mentions that there is a viral video on social media showing a white saree-clad woman surrounded by a crowd, including a purported police officer and a reporter. This video is the primary evidence used to verify the claim.", "Social media views": "The expert's verdict states that the video has nearly 25,000 views on the Facebook account of one Pranab Das. The number of views can be considered as an indicator of the video's popularity and potential reach.", "Multiple captions": "The same video has been shared with different captions, mentioning different names of the alleged TMC candidate. The expert's verdict mentions two different captions, one with the name Sajda Ahmed and the other with the name Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar. This aspect highlights the confusion and inconsistency surrounding the identity of the person in the video.", "Statements in the video": "The expert's verdict provides quotes from the woman in the video where she allegedly says that she will not allow Ram naam, Hari naam, and communist chants, and that she will provide shelter to Rohingyas. These statements are used to evaluate the authenticity of the claim."}
