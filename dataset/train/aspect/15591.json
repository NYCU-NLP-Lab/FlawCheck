{"The original footage of the video was uploaded to YouTube in 2013 with the title": "Watertown Lockdown Surveillance\" and it showed armed officers entering a room, not a marijuana grower hiding. This suggests that the claim of the video showing a marijuana grower is not authentic.", "The video was uploaded to the": "E.A.W. (Everything About Weed)\" Facebook page, which indicates a potential bias towards promoting content related to marijuana. This raises questions about the credibility and authenticity of the claim.", "The YouTube user who uploaded the video also uploaded an edited version to make it appear as if the officers were searching for a marijuana grower": "The video was categorized as \"Comedy\" rather than \"News & Politics,\" suggesting that it was intended for entertainment purposes rather than depicting a real event.", "The Snopes expert mentions a Time article from April 2013 that describes the events in Watertown during the lockdown": "This article does not mention anything about a marijuana grower hiding from law enforcement officers, further undermining the authenticity of the claim."}
