{"Comparison of actual funding to baseline": "The expert compared the actual funding for schools in the years following Scott Walker's budget to the baseline funding under the previous governor, Jim Doyle. This allowed them to determine the difference in funding and assess the claim of $800 million in cuts.", "Examination of specific budget years": "The expert analyzed the specific budget years of 2011-2012 and 2012-2013 to assess the impact on school funding. They found that there was a significant drop in general purpose revenue (GPR) school aid during those years, which contributed to the overall reduction in funding.", "Consideration of Act 10": "The expert noted the importance of Act 10, which was enacted in 2011 and required public employees, including teachers, to contribute more to their pensions and health insurance. This policy change could have affected the overall funding available for schools and contributed to the claimed cuts.", "Evaluation of the impact on schools": "The expert took into account the argument made by Tony Evers' team that the cuts had a significant impact on Wisconsin's public schools. They considered the ongoing effects of the reduction in funding and the potential consequences for students' education."}
