{"Confirmation by the U": "S. Senate: Lloyd Austin's confirmation as the U.S. Secretary of Defense by an overwhelming, bipartisan vote in the U.S. Senate on January 22, 2021, with support from 93 Republican and Democratic senators, indicates that the claim of him planning to \"defund, maybe disband\" the Army and rely on China for national defense is false.", "Austin": "s statements during confirmation hearing: During his confirmation hearing, Lloyd Austin emphasized the importance of maintaining the American military's strategic advantage over China and countering any potential threat posed by the country. This contradicts the claim that he intended to rely on China for national defense.", "Exploitation of racist and xenophobic sentiments": "The expert's verdict highlights that the claim appears to exploit racist and xenophobic sentiments by falsely linking Austin's leadership with unrelated Black Lives Matter protests that called for defunding the police. This suggests that the claim is meant to manipulate public opinion rather than being based on factual information.", "Baseless conspiracy theories": "The claim also leverages baseless conspiracy theories about links between U.S. President Joe Biden and China, which were promoted by Biden's predecessor, Donald Trump. This further undermines the credibility of the claim and indicates a lack of authenticity."}
