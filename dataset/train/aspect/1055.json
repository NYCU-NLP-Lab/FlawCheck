{"The possibility of getting high from secondhand smoke": "The expert's verdict acknowledges that it is indeed possible to get high from secondhand marijuana smoke, but only under specific circumstances such as little to no ventilation.", "Research studies investigating the effects of secondhand cannabis smoke": "The expert mentions that studies have been conducted for decades to examine the impact of secondhand marijuana smoke on nonsmokers. These studies provide evidence supporting the claim of getting high from secondhand smoke.", "Absorption of THC and other cannabinoids by passive participants": "The expert refers to studies conducted in the 1980s that showed passive participants in extreme conditions (such as \"hotboxing\") could absorb enough THC and other cannabinoids to be detected in blood or urine. This supports the claim that exposure to secondhand marijuana smoke can potentially show up in a drug test.", "The 2015 study at Johns Hopkins University": "The expert mentions a specific study conducted at Johns Hopkins University, where groups of smokers and non-smokers were confined in a chamber under ventilated and unventilated conditions. The study concluded that non-smokers could get high indirectly and mildly, further supporting the claim."}
