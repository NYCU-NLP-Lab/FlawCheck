{"The claim is supported by a direct quote from Sen": "Rand Paul, who stated during a Fox News interview that \"there was a Gallup poll in Egypt last year, and 70 percent of Egyptians don't want our money.\" This quote provides the initial basis for the claim.", "The expert": "s verdict additionally cites a September 2012 analysis by Gallup, which suggests that Egyptians may resent U.S. aid because they perceive it as a tool of U.S. influence with Egypt's government. This analysis provides insight into the reasons behind the opposition to U.S. aid and further strengthens the authenticity of the claim."}
