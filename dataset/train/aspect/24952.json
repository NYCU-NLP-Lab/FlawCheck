{"Presence of lobbying disclosure records": "The expert's verdict mentions that lobbying disclosure records from 1989 and 1990 list Gwendolyn G. Logan (Graham's married name at the time) as a lobbyist for the Secondary Lead Smelters Association. This indicates that there is evidence of Graham's involvement in lobbying activities.", "Association with a lobbying law firm": "The expert's verdict states that Graham worked with the law firm Andrews & Kurth, which also engaged in lobbying for certain clients. This association suggests a potential connection to lobbying activities.", "Handwritten staff note referencing Graham": "s involvement: Southerland's camp points to a handwritten staff note from Bob Graham's archive, which includes a sentence indicating that materials related to a lead bill were to be given to Gwen (presumably Gwen Graham). This note is considered by Southerland's camp as proof of Graham's influence in lobbying efforts.", "Counterargument regarding Graham": "s non-participation: Graham's campaign argues that her name being on the lobbying disclosure forms does not prove her active involvement in lobbying. They provide a letter from her former supervisor at Andrews & Kurth, Rob Steinwurtzel, stating that Graham did not participate in any lobbying activities. This counterargument adds another aspect to consider in assessing the authenticity of the claim."}
