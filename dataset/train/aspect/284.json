{"The photo shared on Facebook shows an immense light display of the red and white Canadian flag": "complete with a red maple leaf in its center projected onto Niagara Falls.", "The image does not reflect the reality of light shows at Niagara Falls": "as confirmed by Tony Baldinelli, communications manager for Niagara Parks.", "The Niagara Falls Illumination Board policy prohibits the projection of images onto the falls to preserve their natural elements": "4. On special occasions like Canada Day, the falls are illuminated with colors of symbolic value, but not with a projected maple leaf image as depicted in the fabricated photo."}
