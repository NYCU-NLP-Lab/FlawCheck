{"Comparison with other countries": "The expert compared the United States' mortality rate with that of other countries, specifically focusing on advanced, industrialized nations as well as other countries like Brazil, Mexico, South Africa, Russia, Turkey, Argentina, and India. The comparison revealed that at least 15 advanced nations and several other countries have a lower mortality rate than the United States.", "Case": "fatality rate: The expert clarified that President Trump incorrectly referred to the case-fatality rate as the \"mortality rate.\" The case-fatality rate is another measurement used to assess the severity of COVID-19, and it also does not place the United States at or near the bottom internationally.", "Fact": "checking interview statements: The expert analyzed an interview between President Trump and Chris Wallace, where Trump claimed that the United States has one of the lowest mortality rates in the world. The expert fact-checked this statement and found that Wallace had stated that the United States has the seventh-highest mortality rate in the world, higher than countries like Brazil, Russia, and those in the European Union.", "Analysis of COVID": "19 data: To verify the authenticity of the claim, the expert turned to widely cited coronavirus data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. Specifically, they looked at the university's calculations of COVID-19 deaths per 100,000 in population, which is a standard measurement of mortality rate. This analysis revealed that the United States has the sixth-highest mortality rate among countries with at least 100,000 confirmed cases, with 16 hard-hit nations having a lower mortality rate."}
