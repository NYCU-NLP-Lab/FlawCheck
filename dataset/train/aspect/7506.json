{"Productivity increased during the Reagan era": "The expert's verdict highlights that productivity, measured by \"output per hour\" for workers in the nonfarm business sector, steadily increased during the Reagan administration. The numbers grew from 81.7 to 92.8, indicating a significant rise in productivity.", "Wages remained fairly flat when adjusted for inflation": "The expert's analysis reveals that while average hourly wages increased from $7.44 to $9.80 during the Reagan years, when adjusted for inflation, real wages dipped slightly from $7.89 in 1981 to $7.75 in 1989. This suggests that wages did not keep pace with inflation and remained relatively stagnant.", "Compensation to employees grew during the Reagan era": "The expert notes that when considering factors beyond just wages, such as health benefits and other forms of compensation, the \"real compensation per hour\" paid by companies to nonsupervisory employees increased from 90.2 in 1981 to 95.1 in 1989. This indicates that overall compensation to employees, even when adjusted for inflation, experienced growth during Reagan's presidency.", "Stagnation of average hourly earnings predated Reagan": "The expert points out that the stagnation of average hourly earnings, adjusted for inflation, actually began before Reagan's presidency. Historical data shows that hourly wages climbed steadily until 1973, after which they declined for a few years and then remained relatively frozen until the late 1990s. This suggests that the issue of stagnant wages was not solely a result of Reagan's economic policies."}
