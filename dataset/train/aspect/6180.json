{"The claim is supported by a statement from State Sen": "Bob Deuell, a Republican physician, who mentioned the estimate of 300 babies a year being sent home from the hospital with an unrecognized congenital heart defect during a Senate approval proposal.", "The claim is further supported by the information provided by Kevin Cruser": "chief of staff to Rep. Myra Crownover, who referred to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website. The CDC website includes a link to a 2002 research paper that discusses the incidence of congenital heart disease and mentions that about 300 infants with an unrecognized congenital heart defect are discharged each year from newborn nurseries in the United States.", "The claim is based on data from the CDC website": "which states that about 18 out of every 10,000 babies born in the United States annually have critical congenital heart defects, which usually require surgery or interventions in the first year of life. The CDC also mentions that some babies born with a heart defect can appear healthy at first and be sent home before the defect is detected.", "The claim is supported by the fact that the Texas legislation proposed by Sen": "Bob Deuell aims to introduce mandatory screening tests for newborn Texans, indicating the recognition of the problem and the need for preventive measures."}
