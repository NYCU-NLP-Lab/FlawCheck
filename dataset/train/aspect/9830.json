{"The claim is based on reports from reputable sources": "The New York Times and the Associated Press both reported on the issue of the U.S. government losing track of immigrant children placed in sponsor homes.", "The claim is supported by statements from a government official": "The reports were based on statements made by Steven Wagner, acting assistant secretary of Administration for Children and Families for the Department of Health and Human Services, during a Senate Homeland Security subcommittee oversight hearing.", "The official statements provide specific numbers and details": "Wagner stated that from October to December 2017, the Office of Refugee Resettlement attempted to reach 7,635 unaccompanied alien children (UAC) and their sponsors. Out of this number, they were unable to determine the whereabouts of 1,475 UAC, despite efforts to contact their sponsors.", "The claim is backed by the explanation of the process": "When children cross into the U.S. alone, their custody is transferred from the Department of Homeland Security to the Office of Refugee Resettlement. These children are then released to sponsors in the U.S., who undergo background checks. The inability to verify the whereabouts of some children is attributed to sponsors being unreachable or unresponsive, rather than the children being missing or outside the care of their guardians."}
