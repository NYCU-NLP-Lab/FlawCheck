{"Comparison of treatment": "The expert's verdict highlights the distinct aspects of how Senate Republicans handled the confirmations for Obama's and Trump's high court picks. It points out that Republicans refused to confirm Judge Merrick Garland, Obama's nominee, to the Supreme Court, while they rushed the confirmation process for Judge Amy Coney Barrett, Trump's nominee, before the presidential election. This comparison of treatment between the two nominees verifies the claim of a double standard.", "Racism accusation": "The claim asserts that racism is behind the favoritism shown to Trump by a Republican-controlled Senate. The expert's verdict includes the post on Facebook that accuses systemic racism, stating that a black American president (Obama) was not allowed to name a Supreme Court Justice in the last 10 months of his term, while a white American president (Trump) could name one in the last 46 days. This aspect supports the claim and adds the element of racism as a factor in the confirmation process.", "Confirmation blocking": "The expert's verdict mentions that Republicans immediately opposed an Obama nominee to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia. It further explains that when Obama chose Garland as his nominee, Republicans vowed to block the nomination based on the argument that it was too close to the 2016 presidential election. This aspect verifies the claim of Senate Republicans handling the confirmations differently for Obama and Trump.", "Statements from Republican senators": "The expert's verdict includes statements from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Sen. Mike Lee, both Republicans. McConnell stated that the people should \"have a voice\" about the next justice, indicating a different approach to the confirmation process. Sen. Mike Lee called holding confirmation hearings for Garland a \"waste of time.\" These statements from Republican senators provide evidence of their stance on the nominations and support the claim of a double standard."}
