{"The claim states that Kamala Harris is the prosecutor who refused to charge the police in the murder of Oscar Grant": "This aspect is clearly mentioned in the claim itself.", "The post on Facebook shows two photos side": "by-side, one of Kamala Harris and the other from the movie \"Fruitvale Station\" depicting Oscar Grant with his hands raised. This visual evidence is used to support the claim.", "The San Francisco Chronicle": "s article on Grant's death, which was published less than a month before Harris declared her candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination, does not mention Harris in relation to the case. This aspect suggests that there is no direct connection between Harris and the handling of the case.", "The trial of Johannes Mehserle": "the actual police officer involved in the shooting, was conducted by David Stein, the prosecutor for the district attorney's office. This information further supports the claim that Harris was not directly involved in the case."}
