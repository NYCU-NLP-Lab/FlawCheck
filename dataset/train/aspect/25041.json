{"Lack of evidence": "The expert points out that the false claim provides no evidence to support its claims. There are no statements from the police, despite the claim that the woman had been reported missing. This lack of supporting evidence raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Inconsistent details": "The expert highlights that the story includes inconsistent details that cast doubt on its credibility. For example, the town of Ossippee mentioned in the claim is located in New Hampshire, which is around 300 miles away from Chappaqua, New York. This contradiction undermines the claim's authenticity.", "Satirical source": "The expert reveals that the claim originated from a satirical publication called Flash News Corner. The publication itself admits to presenting fiction as fact and creating stories that are not based on real events. This information discredits the claim as a fabrication created for entertainment purposes.", "History of fabricated stories": "The expert mentions that numerous deaths have been falsely linked to the Clinton estate in upstate New York since Hillary Clinton's unsuccessful 2016 presidential campaign. The claim in question is just one of many invented or falsely tied deaths to the Clintons. This pattern of fabricated stories further undermines the credibility of the claim."}
