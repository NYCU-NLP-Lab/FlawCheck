{"Reference to a study by Wallethub": "The expert's verdict mentions that Pade's campaign pointed to a study by Wallethub, a personal finance website, which ranked Wisconsin as 46th in effective tax rate. This study provides evidence supporting the claim that Wisconsin is one of the highest-taxed states in the country.", "Analysis by Tamarine Cornelius": "Tamarine Cornelius, a research analyst at the Wisconsin Budget Project, states that when looking at state and local taxes, Wisconsin ranks somewhere in the middle. She mentions that state and local taxes in Wisconsin are actually below the national average, especially when fees are included.", "Report from the Tax Foundation": "The expert's verdict mentions a 2018 report from the Tax Foundation, an independent tax policy nonprofit, which shows that Wisconsin is in the middle of the pack when it comes to state tax collections per capita. This report suggests that Wisconsin's tax burden is not among the highest in the country.", "Opinion of Richard Auxier": "Richard Auxier, a research associate with the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center at the Urban Institute, states that it is a stretch to say Wisconsin is one of the highest taxed states in the country. He mentions the state's \"somewhat progressive\" income tax rates and notes that the top rate is not significantly high compared to other states. This expert opinion challenges the claim made by Pade."}
