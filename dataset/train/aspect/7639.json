{"The claim was shared on Facebook on December 24": "2020, along with several photos showing Lady Justice statues, with four of them blindfolded and one without a blindfold.", "The Korean": "language text in the post translates to English, stating that the Lady Justice statues in other countries are blindfolded to remain impartial, while the one in South Korea is not wearing a blindfold to identify those who could benefit the judiciary.", "The claim is misleading as South Korea is not the only country with a Lady Justice statue without a blindfold": "Examples include Australia, Hungary, and the United Kingdom, which also have statues without blindfolds.", "Scholars note that the earliest representations of Lady Justice did not show her blindfolded": "and the origin of the blindfold is unclear, with different theories suggesting it was added to symbolize tolerance or ignorance of abuse of the law by the judicial system."}
