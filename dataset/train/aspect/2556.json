{"Historical inaccuracies": "The expert points out that the list of Democrats involved in assassinations, assassination attempts, or mass shootings has always been rife with errors. For example, the claim initially listed Lincoln's alleged death-by-Democrat in 1863 instead of the correct year, 1865.", "Biased and flawed message": "The expert highlights the anti-Democrat and pro-NRA message that accompanies the circulation of this list. They question the logic of using this meme to conclude that Democrats shouldn't own guns, as it ignores shootings committed by Republicans or individuals with no political affiliation.", "Lack of comprehensive information": "The expert notes that the list is not comprehensive and fails to include all shootings in the United States or the political affiliations of every shooter. The claim also doesn't attempt to demonstrate how political affiliation directly leads to violence.", "Lack of credible documentation": "The expert mentions that they searched for contemporary reports to verify the listed incidents and uncover any political affiliations or motivations. However, many of the items on the list were found to be based on poor reporting, corrected articles, or fake news. Additionally, none of the websites that published the meme provided any documentation to support the claims."}
