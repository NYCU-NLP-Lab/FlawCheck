{"Lack of official records": "The speech attributed to Lord Macaulay does not exist in the Hansard archives, which document parliamentary records from the early 19th century to the present. Additionally, Columbia University's records of Macaulay's life and work do not mention this speech.", "Inconsistencies in timeline and location": "The speech claims to have been given on February 2, 1835, in the British parliament. However, parliament was closed during that period, and Lord Macaulay was in India serving various posts. This raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Contradictory versions and widespread circulation": "A similar version of the speech with the word \"Africa\" replaced with \"India\" has been circulated online in India. This suggests that the speech has been altered and adapted to fit different contexts, further questioning its authenticity. Additionally, the speech has been widely shared on social media in Africa since at least 2015, but without concrete evidence of its origin or source.", "Doubts about the accompanying photograph": "Several historians have expressed skepticism about the photograph accompanying the quote, stating that it does not depict Lord Macaulay. This raises concerns about the accuracy and attribution of the speech to Lord Macaulay."}
