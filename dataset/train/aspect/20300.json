{"The claim is based on the interpretation of the 27th Amendment of the Constitution": "which states that any law changing the compensation for senators and representatives cannot take effect until after an election of representatives has occurred.", "The claim relies on procedural votes in Congress to suspend pay increases": "as members cannot directly vote to raise or lower their own pay.", "The claim specifically cites a vote by Sherrod Brown on the Treasury and General Government Appropriations bill for fiscal 1997": "where he voted against a pay-freeze provision that would have denied the automatic pay increase.", "The claim highlights the complexity of the legislative process and the existence of an automatic annual cost of living adjustment for members of Congress": "which can result in their pay increasing without a direct vote."}
