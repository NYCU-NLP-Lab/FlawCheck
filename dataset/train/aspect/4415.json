{"Lack of valid projections": "The expert's verdict highlights that none of the individuals who made the claim about the health care law being the biggest job-killer could provide valid projections of job losses. Instead, they relied on partisan reports or skewed interpretations of independent reports as evidence.", "Misinterpretation of independent reports": "The expert's verdict points out that one Republican document cited a 2010 report by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) as evidence that the health care law would lead to significant job losses. However, the report did not actually state that. It mentioned a reduction in the amount of labor in the economy by roughly half a percent, primarily due to factors like workers choosing to retire earlier or more people seeking jobs due to Medicaid expansion.", "Inaccurate claims about penalties": "The expert's verdict mentions that Governor Rick Scott claimed that the health care law would impose \"unbelievable penalties\" that would have to go up, contributing to it being a job-killer. However, the verdict does not support this claim and suggests that it is a falsehood repeated during the health care debate.", "Previous claims debunked by fact": "checkers: The expert's verdict highlights that similar claims about the health care law's job-killing effect from other individuals, such as House Republican Leader Eric Cantor, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and former U.S. Senate candidate Adam Hasner, did not fare well on fact-checking websites like PolitiFact. This suggests a lack of credibility and evidence supporting the claim."}
