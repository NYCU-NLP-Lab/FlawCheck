{"Lack of evidence for the claim": "The expert's verdict highlights that there is no evidence to support the claim that Jacob Blake would not have been shot if he was still in prison for raping a 14-year-old. The posts on social media that make this claim offer no evidence or supporting information.", "Distorted and unfounded claims": "The expert's verdict mentions that the shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin, led to distorted and unfounded claims on social media. This suggests that the claim regarding Blake's past criminal history is one such distorted and unfounded claim.", "Jacob Blake": "s actual charges: The expert's verdict clarifies that Jacob Blake was charged in July with third-degree sexual assault, trespassing, and disorderly conduct. However, these charges do not relate to raping a 14-year-old, as falsely claimed in the social media posts. The expert's verdict provides accurate information about the charges against Blake.", "Lack of supporting records": "The expert's verdict states that the allegation made in the claim does not align with publicly available records. The Wisconsin Sex Offender Registry does not show any matches for Jacob Blake's name, and other court records only include a traffic violation and custody disputes. This lack of supporting records further undermines the authenticity of the claim."}
