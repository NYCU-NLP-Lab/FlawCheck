{"The claim is supported by the work of Rutgers University law scholar Douglas Husak": "who states that 70 percent of American adults have committed a crime that could lead to imprisonment. This adds credibility to the claim as it is based on research conducted by a legal expert.", "The existence of over 300": "000 federal regulations that may be enforceable through criminal punishment is cited as evidence to support the claim. This suggests that there is a vast number of laws that could potentially lead to imprisonment, increasing the likelihood of individuals committing a crime without even realizing it.", "The fact that the laws on prescription drugs can potentially lead to imprisonment is highlighted as another aspect supporting the claim": "For example, the act of a spouse bringing a prescription drug to someone in bed without a license is considered dispensing a controlled substance without a license, which is a criminal offense. This demonstrates how seemingly innocent actions can be classified as crimes.", "Instances of common offenses": "such as drunk driving, are mentioned as further evidence for the claim. The Centers for Disease Control reported 112 million self-reported incidences of drunk driving in a single year, indicating that a significant percentage of the population engages in criminal behavior without necessarily being caught or prosecuted."}
