{"Visual observations": "Online viewers and social media users noticed that some of the missiles displayed during the parade appeared to be wobbling in the wind and one even seemed to be bent. These visual anomalies raised doubts about the authenticity of the missiles.", "Expert analysis": "Lee Il-Woo, a senior analyst at the private Korea Defence Network, expressed suspicion that all the missiles could be mock-ups aimed at impressing the outside world. This expert opinion added weight to the claim that the missiles were fake.", "Caution from security experts": "Euan Graham, the director of the international security program at the Lowy Institute for International Policy, cautioned against dismissing North Korea's arsenal as illusory based solely on visual oddities. He explained that North Korea may have paraded empty canisters to reduce the risk of airstrikes and create doubt and uncertainty for defense planners.", "Comparison with real missiles": "The claim that North Korea's missiles were fake was largely based on the observation of an oddly shaped nose cone. However, it was pointed out that similar nose cones can also be seen on real S-200 missiles. This comparison highlighted the need for further investigation to determine the authenticity of the displayed missiles."}
