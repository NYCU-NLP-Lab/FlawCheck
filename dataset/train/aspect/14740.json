{"Comparison of campaign spending": "The expert analyzed the campaign finance data from the Georgia 6th District race between Lucy McBath and Karen Handel. They found that Handel had spent $7.99 million, while McBath had spent $1.23 million, resulting in a 6.5-to-1 spending ratio in Handel's favor. This information contradicts the claim that McBath was outspent 5-1.", "Context of the claim": "The expert provided background information about the election, highlighting McBath's victory over Handel in the 2018 midterm elections. They mentioned that McBath's win was driven by suburban Atlanta voters' frustration over gun violence. This context helps to evaluate the claim's accuracy within the broader political landscape.", "Source credibility": "The expert referred to a tweet from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Democratic lawmaker, praising McBath's victory. However, they also pointed out that Ocasio-Cortez's tweet did not provide a complete picture of the campaign spending, as it included money from the previous high-spending special election in 2017. By highlighting this discrepancy, the expert assessed the reliability of the claim's source.", "Explanation of data organization": "The expert explained that the campaign finance data on OpenSecrets.org, which was used to verify the claim, is organized according to the Federal Election Commission's tabulation. They clarified that Handel's total spending was artificially inflated by her previous race against Jon Ossoff, which officially falls within the 2018 election cycle. This clarification helps to interpret the campaign spending data accurately."}
