{"Rep": "Dave Brat's statement: In the claim, Rep. Dave Brat states that every one person with DACA can bring in their entire extended family once they reach a certain status, which could result in 3 or 4 million immigrants. This statement is crucial in verifying the authenticity of the claim.", "Chuck Todd": "s clarification: Chuck Todd interjects and corrects Brat, stating that they are not talking about 8 billion people, but rather about the approximate number of 800,000 young people who are part of the DACA program. This clarification helps to establish the accurate number of individuals involved in the DACA program.", "Brat": "s office explanation: Brat's office confirms that DACA recipients can bring in extended family members once they obtain green cards. This information supports Brat's claim about chain migration and the potential for an increase in the number of immigrants.", "Juliana Heerschap": "s statement: Juliana Heerschap, Brat's communications director, explains that there is currently a loophole for DACA recipients to become eligible for green cards, allowing them to petition for immediate and extended family members to come to the United States. This statement further reinforces the possibility of chain migration and validates Brat's claim."}
