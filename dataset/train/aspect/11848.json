{"The claim is based on statements made by Paul Mango": "a Republican candidate for governor, who referred to Governor Tom Wolf as \"Thomas the Tax Engine\" and accused him of proposing tax increases.", "Mango": "s campaign advisor provided a spreadsheet showing estimated revenue from tax increases and modifications in Wolf's executive budgets for the years 2015-16, 2016-17, and 2017-18.", "The estimate for 2015": "16 in Mango's spreadsheet differed significantly from the revenue estimate in Wolf's own budget, indicating a discrepancy in the calculation of tax increases.", "The campaign revised their numbers to project": "8.6 billion in \"tax increases\" during Wolf's time in office, which appears to be a combination of positive revenue estimates from tax modifications."}
