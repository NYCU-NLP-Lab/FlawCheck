{"The expert contacted Norton": "s office to ask for evidence or backup for her claim about Ken Buck's office spending, but they did not respond. This lack of response raises questions about the validity of Norton's claim.", "The expert reviewed budget documents from Weld County to verify the accuracy of the claim": "They found that there are different ways to interpret the budget numbers, depending on whether special programs are included. However, when looking at the base budgets, the expert found that the 2005 budget was closer to $3.2 million, not $3.4 million as stated in Norton's ad. This discrepancy undermines the credibility of the claim.", "The Weld County Commission confirmed that the District Attorney": "s budget increased by 30 percent during Ken Buck's tenure, not the 40 percent claimed by Norton. The commission defended the increase, stating that it was necessary due to the county's growing population and the increase in the number of courts in Weld County. This official statement contradicts Norton's claim and casts doubt on its accuracy.", "The expert also noted that Norton": "s ad was a response to attack ads run by Americans for Job Security, a pro-business advocacy group. By examining the context of the claim and the motivations behind the ads, the expert provides a broader perspective on the situation and raises questions about the credibility of the claims made by both Norton and the advocacy group."}
