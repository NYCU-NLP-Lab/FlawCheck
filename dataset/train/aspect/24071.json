This connection is used to imply that the man was a member of the TMC (Trinamool Congress) party, which was accused of orchestrating the violence.", "Retweets by BJP leaders": "The expert's verdict mentions that the video was retweeted by multiple users, including BJP leaders such as the Prime Minister. This is presented as evidence that the claim gained traction and credibility among influential individuals, potentially contributing to its authenticity.", "Analysis of the video itself": "The expert's verdict highlights several hints within the video that suggest it does not depict the violence at Kolkata's Vidyasagar college. These hints include the dialect spoken by the men in the video, which is uncommon in West Bengal and resembles the accents of people from Hindi-speaking East Indian states. Additionally, the location where the man was caught does not match the streets where the violence during Shah's roadshow took place. This analysis of the video is used to question the authenticity of the claim."}
