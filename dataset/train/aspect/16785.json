{"Testimony from Lisa Hamler": "Fugitt: The expert's verdict mentions the testimony of Lisa Hamler-Fugitt, the executive director of the Ohio Association of Second Harvest Foodbanks. She stated during a hearing that Ohio currently ranks 50th out of all states in income growth.", "Increase in participation in food assistance programs": "Hamler-Fugitt also mentioned that the need for food assistance has increased dramatically since 2008 due to the recession and has been growing over the past decade as the number of Ohioans in poverty increased by almost 50 percent.", "Lack of correlation between national economy and food aid recipients": "Hamler-Fugitt stated that her agency has not observed a correlation between the state of the national economy and the number of people receiving food aid in Ohio. This suggests that Ohio's income growth may not be improving despite the overall economic recovery.", "Analysis based on data from the U": "S. Bureau of Economic Analysis: Hamler-Fugitt cited an analysis that looked at income growth over the past 50 years using data from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. The analysis revealed that Ohio had the slowest rate of growth in disposable income compared to other states, ranking 51st in the analysis."}
