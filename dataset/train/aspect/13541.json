{"Lack of evidence": "The expert's verdict highlights that there is little to no evidence to support the claim of female athletes getting pregnant and aborting the baby to enhance their performance through hormone doping. This lack of evidence undermines the credibility of the claim.", "Cold War politics and rumors": "The expert mentions that the origins of these rumors can be traced back to Cold War politics, particularly involving Soviet bloc countries. The allegations of intentional impregnation and subsequent termination of pregnancies by coaches or trainers were fueled by these political tensions and may have gained undue credibility.", "Historical accusations": "The expert refers to past instances where Western media outlets accused Soviet bloc countries of female athletes using terminated pregnancies for hormonal and physiological benefits. These accusations date back to the 1956 Melbourne Olympics and resurfaced in the 1964 Tokyo Olympics. However, no conclusive proof of such abuse has ever been produced.", "Questionable confirmation": "The expert mentions a 1994 German media report that claimed to provide confirmation of the practice of intentional pregnancies and abortions for performance enhancement. The report featured an interview with a Soviet gymnast, Olga Kovalenko, who confessed to having an abortion before the 1968 Olympic Games in Mexico. However, the credibility of this confirmation is questionable, as it was presented by a German television station and no further evidence or corroboration was provided."}
