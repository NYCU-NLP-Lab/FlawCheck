{"The video shared by Latin Post featured clips from various videos uploaded to YouTube between 2011 and 2013": "indicating that the claim of strange apocalyptic sounds coming from the sky was not a recent phenomenon.", "The comments under these videos often contained exaggerated claims suggesting that the world was coming to an end": "indicating a tendency for sensationalism and fear-mongering surrounding the topic.", "Scientific research suggests that most unusual and unexplained noises have natural causes such as tidal waves": "methane explosions, underground earthquakes, or shifting sand dunes. These explanations point to earthly origins for the reported sounds.", "The US Geological Survey scientist": "David Hill, who has studied mystery booms and strange sounds, suggests that earthquakes are likely responsible for the majority of cases. He has observed evidence of small earthquakes causing audible noises and believes that judders near the surface can transmit cracking crust sounds. Additionally, Hill mentions the possibility of some noises originating from above, such as meteors, although they may not always be visible."}
