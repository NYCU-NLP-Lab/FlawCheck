{"The claim made by Gov": "Maggie Hassan during her State of the State address that \"Drug overdoses are now the second-most common cause of death in New Hampshire\" is the starting point for the verification process.", "PolitiFact New Hampshire decided to fact": "check this claim and examine the numbers to determine if drug overdoses are indeed the second leading cause of death in the state, surpassing other causes such as diabetes, breast cancer, and motor vehicle accidents.", "The verification process involved analyzing a chart created by New Futures": "a statewide advocacy organization that focuses on substance abuse. This chart compared drug deaths to other mortality statistics from 2014 and showed that drug overdose deaths ranked second, behind Alzheimer's disease.", "However": "it is important to note that the chart did not include every cause of death and omitted conditions that led to far more deaths than drug overdoses and Alzheimer's disease in 2014, such as heart disease, chronic lower respiratory disease, and stroke. The New Futures spokesman clarified that the purpose of the slide was not to rank causes of death but to provide perspective on drug deaths compared to similar mortality causes."}
