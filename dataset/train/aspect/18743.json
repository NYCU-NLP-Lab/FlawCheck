{"The claim is supported by a quote from former Georgia Republican Party Chair Sue Everhart": "who stated that \"David thinks he\u2019s better than 72 percent of Georgians who did not have the chance to finish college.\"", "The article mentions that the authenticity of the claim was questioned": "as it seems unlikely that only 28 percent of Georgians finished college in this age of emphasis on higher education.", "The article provides information about Karen Handel": "the Republican U.S. Senate candidate, who did not finish college but has held significant positions such as chair of the Fulton County Board of Commissioners and Georgia secretary of state.", "The article includes a quote from David Perdue": "Handel's GOP rival, who stated that \"there are a lot of good, hard-working Americans who have more common sense in their pinkie finger than a lot of those Ivy League pieces of paper up on a wall that represent some elitism.\" This quote further supports the claim that Perdue may have a dismissive attitude towards those who did not finish college."}
