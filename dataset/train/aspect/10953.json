This statement from a reliable source indicated that the institution did not officially criticize Nusrat Jahan.", "It was revealed that Mufti Asad Qasmi": "the cleric who was portrayed as being associated with Darul Uloom Deoband, was not actually affiliated with the institution. He had been featured in news studios before to comment on Nusrat Jahan's life choices, and his personal statements were falsely presented as the views of Islamic clerics and even as a fatwa issued against Jahan.", "Alt News": "a fact-checking organization, had previously spoken to Asad Qasmi and confirmed that he had no association with Darul Uloom Deoband. Alt News's detailed report exposed the misinformation surrounding Qasmi's statements and clarified his actual background as a former student of the institution who is currently a Mufti in Deoband."}
