{"The claim is a rehash of a controversy from 2019 when President Trump threatened to withhold aid from California while offering help to Russia": "The expert's verdict states that the Trump administration has provided federal assistance to California for the recent wildfires, debunking the claim.", "The first part of the claim": "which states that Trump denied federal aid to California, is proven to be false. The expert's verdict mentions that Trump declared a major disaster in California and allocated $7.7 million in federal relief funds for those affected by the wildfires.", "The second part of the claim": "which suggests that Trump offered to help Putin with fires in Russia, is partially true. The Kremlin announced in July 2019 that Trump had offered U.S. support in fighting Siberian wildfires. However, there is no evidence that the U.S. actually assisted Russia in fighting those fires.", "The expert": "s verdict also mentions Trump's criticism of California Governor Gavin Newsom and his claims about poor forest management contributing to the extent of the seasonal California fires. This criticism is related to Trump's offer to help Russia and has been a recurring theme in his statements about California fires."}
