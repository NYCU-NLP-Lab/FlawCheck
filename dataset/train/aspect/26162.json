{"The claim is based on localised": "incompatible data: The expert's verdict highlights that the claim of a surge in teenage pregnancies in sub-Saharan Africa is based on data that is not representative of the entire region. The data used by World Vision includes information from Tanzania and Sierra Leone, which may not accurately reflect the situation across sub-Saharan Africa.", "Lack of explanation on data utilization": "World Vision did not provide a clear explanation of how they used the data from Tanzania and Sierra Leone to arrive at the figure of one million school girls becoming pregnant across the region. This lack of transparency raises doubts about the accuracy and validity of the claim.", "Experts question the data and warn of unreliability": "The expert's verdict mentions that experts do not believe that the data presented supports the claim made by World Vision. They also caution against using data gathered under varied and localized circumstances to make generalizations about sub-Saharan Africa as a whole.", "Lack of response from World Vision": "Despite being questioned about their data utilization and methodology, World Vision did not provide any response or clarification. This lack of engagement further undermines the authenticity of the claim."}
