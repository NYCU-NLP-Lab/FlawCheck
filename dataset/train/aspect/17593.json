{"Lack of evidence": "The expert's verdict states that there is no evidence to support the claim that the woman in the photo is Stanford law professor Pamela Karlan. This lack of evidence undermines the authenticity of the claim.", "Reverse": "image search: The expert conducted a reverse-image search and found that the photograph was originally posted on a Flickr page in 2007 as part of an album for the annual \"Bay to Breakers\" race in San Francisco. The caption of the photo does not mention the person's name, casting doubt on the claim that it is Professor Karlan.", "Confirmation from race officials": "The expert reached out to race officials to inquire about Karlan's participation in the 2007 \"Bay to Breakers\" race. However, the officials stated that their registration data does not go back that far, and there is no mention of Karlan in news coverage of the event. This further weakens the claim's authenticity.", "Karlan": "s denial: Professor Karlan herself responded to the fact-checkers and stated that she did not attend the race and that the photograph is not of her. This direct denial from the person involved adds credibility to the conclusion that the claim is false."}
