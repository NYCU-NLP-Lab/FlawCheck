{"Lack of evidence and reports": "The expert's verdict highlights that there were no reports or evidence of zip ties being used as a tactic to mark women as targets for sex trafficking. The San Angelo Police Department specifically stated that they had not received any reports of human trafficking or kidnappings related to zip ties.", "Origin of the hoax": "The expert's verdict mentions that the hoax originated in October 2018 after social media posts claimed that sex traffickers in San Angelo, Texas were using zip ties for marking and kidnapping. This information suggests that the claim may have been spread through unreliable sources on social media.", "Law enforcement reports": "While there have been instances where law enforcement reported the use of zip ties by perpetrators to bind victims, the expert's verdict states that no legitimate mentions were found of zip ties being used to target or distract people. This implies that the claim lacks credible evidence or support from law enforcement sources.", "Expert opinion": "The expert's verdict includes a statement from a spokesperson of the Polaris Project, a nonprofit organization combating human trafficking. The statement emphasizes that most human traffickers use psychological means to lure victims, such as tricking or manipulating them, rather than employing tactics like marking targets with zip ties. This expert opinion contradicts the claim and further questions its authenticity."}
