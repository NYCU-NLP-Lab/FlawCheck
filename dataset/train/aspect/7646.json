{"Comparison to a published article": "The expert investigated the claim made by Ted Ankrum by referring to an op-ed column in The New York Times titled \"Unsafe at Any Meal\" written by Eric Schlosser, author of \"Fast Food Nation.\" This article mentioned that the number of Americans killed annually by contaminated food is roughly the same as the number of Americans killed in Iraq and Afghanistan since 2003.", "Verification of casualty numbers": "The expert checked the casualty counts from the Iraq Coalition Casualties Count and the U.S. Department of Defense to determine the total number of U.S. troops killed in Iraq and Afghanistan. This was done to compare it with the claim made by Ankrum.", "Reference to official data": "The expert referred to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for information on foodborne illnesses and deaths related to them. The CDC estimated that there are 5,000 deaths related to foodborne illnesses each year in the United States.", "Confirmation from a CDC official": "The expert reached out to Barbara Mahon, a CDC official, who confirmed the 5,000 deaths figure related to foodborne illnesses. Mahon also mentioned that this figure was declared in a 1999 article, but it remains the best number to cite until the CDC completes an update."}
