Donald Whitehead, executive director for the National Coalition for the Homeless, stated that homeless individuals are certainly eligible. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) also confirmed that they are working with partner groups to ensure that as many people, including those in the homeless community, receive the stimulus payments as possible.", "Reference to the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021": "The expert's verdict mentions that President Joe Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 into law, which included direct payments of up to $1,400 for eligible Americans. The law does not disqualify homeless individuals from receiving the stimulus payment.", "Previous eligibility and filing requirements": "The expert's verdict highlights that homeless people were eligible for two rounds of stimulus payments in 2020. It is also mentioned that the IRS offered a tool for those who did not file a tax return to apply for the payment. However, for the third payment, individuals who have not previously filed a return or used the nonfilers tool must file a 2020 tax return, even if they are not typically required to under income guidelines, in order to receive the stimulus payment."}
