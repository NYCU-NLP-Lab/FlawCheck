{"The claim is based on a flier from Friends of Kyle Williams": "which stated that State Rep. Elena Parent \"supported Governor Nathan Deal\u2019s plan to slash the HOPE scholarship.\" This flier is presented as evidence for the claim.", "A reader received a robocall from Roy Barnes": "the last Democrat to serve as Georgia\u2019s governor, who claimed that the ad was full of inaccurate information about Parent. This indicates that there is a dispute about the accuracy of the claim and raises the question of which candidate is correct.", "Parent and Williams are running to represent District 42 in the Georgia Senate": "and Parent is the executive director of Georgia Watch, a consumer rights nonprofit. These details provide background information about the candidates and their positions, which can help evaluate the claim.", "The flier contained a footnote concerning a bill passed by the Georgia Legislature in 2011 that altered the HOPE program": "The Williams campaign provided documents showing that Parent voted in favor of a bill proposed by Deal and other Republicans to make changes to HOPE. However, it is mentioned that these documents did not include a key element. The details of this bill and its impact on the HOPE scholarship program are relevant to determining the authenticity of the claim."}
