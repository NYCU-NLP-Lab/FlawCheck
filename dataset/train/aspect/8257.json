{"Size comparison": "The expert's verdict mentions that the asteroid is estimated to have a diameter between 1,300 and 2,230 feet, which is at least double the height of the Golden Gate Bridge. This aspect helps verify the claim by providing a specific measurement and comparing it to a well-known landmark.", "Safe distance": "The expert's verdict states that the asteroid is predicted to pass by Earth at a safe distance of 1.25 million miles away. This aspect supports the claim by assuring that there is no immediate threat of a collision with our planet.", "Orbital path accuracy": "The expert mentions that the asteroid's orbital path has been accurately tracked for 20 years, ensuring that there is no chance it will get any closer to Earth than 1.25 million miles. This aspect reinforces the claim by highlighting the scientific knowledge and tracking of the asteroid's trajectory.", "Potentially hazardous object classification": "The expert states that the astronomical community considers the asteroid to be a potentially hazardous object (PHO), which means it could be a hazard if it deviates from its predicted path and collides with Earth. This aspect acknowledges the potential risk associated with the asteroid while also emphasizing that the current prediction does not indicate any such collision."}
