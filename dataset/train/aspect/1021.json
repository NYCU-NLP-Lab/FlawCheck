Jeff Landry, and Alabama Republican Party chair Bill Armistead, made statements asserting that Obamacare is the largest tax increase in history. This aspect verifies that the claim was propagated by influential individuals.", "Rush Limbaugh": "a prominent conservative radio talk show host, also made a statement declaring Obamacare as the largest tax increase in the history of the world.
