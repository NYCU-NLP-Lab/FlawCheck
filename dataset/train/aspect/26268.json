{"Comparison of voter registration data": "The experts examined the voter registration data provided by Judicial Watch and compared it to the data from state election officials. They analyzed the numbers to determine if there were discrepancies between the registered voters and the eligible voting-age population.", "Examination of the American Community Survey data": "The experts also evaluated the American Community Survey (ACS) data provided by the U.S. Census Bureau. They assessed the accuracy and reliability of this data, specifically the \"citizen voting age population\" (CVAP) figures, which were used to compare with the voter registration data.", "Evaluation of the methodology used": "The experts assessed the methodology employed by Judicial Watch in conducting their study. They scrutinized the spreadsheet and the calculations used to determine the number of \"ghost voters\" in each county. They looked for any potential flaws or biases in the methodology that could affect the accuracy of the claim.", "Consultation with statistical experts": "To ensure a comprehensive analysis, the experts consulted with statistical experts, such as statistician Philip Stark from the University of California at Berkeley. These experts provided insights into the limitations and potential issues with comparing different datasets and the use of sample-based surveys like the ACS. Their input helped to validate or challenge the claim made by Judicial Watch and provide a more accurate assessment of the authenticity of the claim."}
