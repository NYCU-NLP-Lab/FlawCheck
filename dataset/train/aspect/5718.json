{"The claim originated from a tweet by Ashlee Marie Preston": "which stated that Kim Kardashian was filing for divorce from Kanye West. However, the link in Preston's tweet did not lead to a news article confirming the divorce, but rather to a voter registration page on the Vote.gov website. This raised suspicions about the authenticity of the claim.", "Elle magazine also tweeted about the alleged divorce": "sharing a link that did not lead to news about Kardashian and West divorcing, but to a \"Register to Vote\" page on the When We All Vote website. This further added to the doubts surrounding the claim.", "The timing of both tweets coincided with the 2018 midterm elections": "when various organizations, politicians, and celebrities were encouraging young people to register and vote. This suggested that the purpose of these tweets may have been to divert attention from celebrity gossip to civic duties, rather than providing accurate information about the divorce.", "A study conducted by computer scientists at Columbia University and the French National Institute found that nearly 60": "of people on social media shared links without first clicking them. This highlights a potentially harmful habit among social media users and raises questions about the credibility of claims shared on these platforms."}
