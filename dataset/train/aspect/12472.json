{"Donald Trump": "s claim that Hillary Clinton plans a massive tax increase is verified as partially true. The Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center confirms that Clinton does propose an increase in taxes, but it is targeted at the highest earners and would not affect most Americans.", "Clinton": "s tax plan would increase revenues collected by $1.1 trillion over 10 years, representing a 2.5 percent increase in projected revenue for the decade. While the term \"massive\" is subjective, experts from the Tax Policy Center and the Tax Foundation agree that Clinton's proposed tax plan is not as extensive as Trump portrays it.", "These changes would primarily impact the richest taxpayers": "with the top 5 percent seeing an average increase of $2,673 or a reduction of less than 1 percent in after-tax income. The top 1 percent would experience an average increase of $78,000, equal to a 5 percent reduction in after-tax income. The top one-tenth of 1 percent, earning $3.7 million or above, would face an extra tax bite of $520,000 or a 7.6 percent reduction in after-tax income."}
