{"The claim is based on historical examples": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim refers to three specific instances in the 20th century when top marginal tax rates were lowered - the 1920s under Warren G. Harding and Calvin Coolidge, the 1960s under John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson, and the 1980s under Ronald Reagan. These historical examples are employed to support the claim that revenues increased and the economy improved after the tax rates were lowered.", "Tax revenue data is cited": "The expert's verdict mentions that Walker's spokesperson pointed to increases in tax revenue that followed marginal tax cuts in the mentioned periods. This suggests that actual data on tax revenues was used to verify the claim, indicating that there is evidence to support the assertion that revenues went up after the tax rates were lowered.", "Expert opinions were sought": "The expert's verdict states that a group of experts was consulted to assess whether Walker's argument is reasonable. This indicates that the authenticity of the claim was verified by seeking expert opinions and considering their analysis and evaluation of the claim.", "Acknowledgment of complexity and caution": "The expert's verdict includes a statement from Andrew Reschovsky, a professor emeritus of public affairs and applied economics, who highlights the complexity of economic growth and decline. This suggests that the experts took into account the multifaceted nature of economic factors and cautioned against oversimplifying the relationship between tax rates and economic outcomes. This demonstrates a thorough and cautious approach to verifying the claim."}
