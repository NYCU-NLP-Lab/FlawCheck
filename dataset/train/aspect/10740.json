{"Statistical data": "The expert analyzed data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and found that fracking accounted for a small percentage (2.3 to 2.5 percent) of all jobs created in Ohio between 2010 and 2014. Factoring in jobs created in related industries, the percentage increased to 6.9 to 7.9 percent of all jobs.", "Expert opinions": "The expert consulted with industry experts who stated that Trump's claim of fracking being the reason for Ohio's economic success was an exaggeration. The expert also quoted Amy Hanauer, the executive director of a think tank, who disagreed with Trump's statement and argued that Ohio was not actually doing well.", "Economic analysis": "The expert mentioned a 2012 economic analysis sponsored by pro-industry entities, which projected that fracking would bring $500 billion and 200,000 jobs to Ohio. However, the expert pointed out that fracking in Ohio did not live up to these expectations due to low oil prices and production.", "Job creation percentage": "Kasich's spokesperson and the expert's own analysis both indicated that fracking was responsible for a relatively small percentage (2.6 percent) of the total jobs created in Ohio during the specified time period. This suggests that while fracking did contribute to job creation, it was not the primary driver of Ohio's economic success."}
