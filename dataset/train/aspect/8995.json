{"Silverman": "s claim is based on the average difference in earnings between men and women, using 2013 Census income and poverty data for full-time, year-round workers who are 15 years old and up. The median wage for women was $39,157 and for men was $50,033, resulting in an average difference of $10,876, which rounds up to Silverman's claim of $11,000.", "However": "other sources of earnings data show a smaller average annual earnings difference between men and women. In 2013, median weekly earnings for women were $706, or $39,520 a year, while men earned $860 a week, or $44,720 a year. This produces a much smaller average annual earnings difference of $5,200, which would translate to $208,000 over a career, not $500,000.", "Some economists argue that using the average difference in earnings for one year may not accurately represent the lifetime earnings of the mean and median female worker": "They suggest calculating the lifetime earnings based on a longer time period to provide a more accurate assessment.", "There is also a debate among economists about whether to examine hourly wages by gender": "as it includes part-time workers who are more often women. This approach may provide a different perspective on the gender wage gap compared to looking solely at full-time, year-round workers."}
