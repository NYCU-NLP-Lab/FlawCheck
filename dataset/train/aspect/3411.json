{"Press Secretary": "s statement: The expert's verdict mentions that Biden's Press Secretary, Jen Psaki, confirmed that someone at the White House approached Major, the family's youngest dog, on March 8, 2021, resulting in a minor injury. This statement provides a key piece of information to verify the claim.", "Dogs": "trip to Delaware: The expert's verdict states that the dogs' trip to Delaware was scheduled before the incident involving Major and was a result of Jill Biden's work schedule, not the dogs' behavior. This aspect helps verify that the dogs' relocation was not directly related to the alleged biting incident.", "Unclear details of the incident": "The expert's verdict highlights that the exact way Major injured someone and the victim's relationship or status within the White House remain unknown. This lack of specific information makes it challenging to fully verify the claim.", "Anonymous sources and media reporting": "The expert's verdict mentions that the rumor about the dogs' behavior and relocation originated from two anonymous sources who spoke to CNN. The fact that these sources remained unnamed raises questions about the credibility of the information. Additionally, the recirculation of the news by other reputable outlets without on-the-record sources adds further complexity to verifying the claim."}
