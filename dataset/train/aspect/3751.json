{"The first aspect employed to verify the authenticity of the claim is the examination of the photos included in the Facebook post": "The expert conducted reverse image searches for each photo and found that they were not directly linked to Fukushima. The first image of a shark with tumors around its mouth was published in 2013, predating the Fukushima disaster.", "The second aspect involves the analysis of the second photo showing a fish with a skin lesion": "The expert discovered that this photo is at least seven years old and was used in a story about contaminants near oil sands operations in Canada, unrelated to Fukushima.", "The third aspect revolves around the investigation of the third image included in the Facebook post": "A search using TinEye, an image search tool, revealed a 2012 article from the Alaska Dispatch News, which discussed the potential effects of Fukushima on Alaska's seafood industry. However, the article did not provide concrete evidence linking Fukushima to cancer or mutations in marine life.", "The fourth aspect considered by the expert is the overall lack of evidence supporting the claim": "The expert highlighted that while sharks and fish can develop cancerous tumors, there is little evidence to suggest that marine life far from Japan has been affected by the Fukushima disaster. Additionally, the expert mentioned that reports of cancerous tumors in marine animals have been increasing over the past 20 years, raising concerns about industrial pollutants or human activities as potential triggers, rather than solely attributing them to Fukushima."}
