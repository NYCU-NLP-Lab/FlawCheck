{"Lack of evidence": "The expert's verdict highlights that there was no evidence to support the claim of chloroform kidnappings involving Mr. Softee ice cream trucks. The rumor lacked specific details such as dates, places, police departments involved, and links to news reports.", "Confirmation from police": "The expert mentions that the only incident involving questionable ice cream trucks found was in April 2016 in Kansas City, Missouri. However, the police confirmed that the individuals were not kidnappers or attempted abductors. This confirmation from the police adds to the authenticity verification.", "Social media rumor": "The expert notes that the claim originated from a Facebook post in June 2016, which was shared by pages called \"Trending Styles\" and \"Stylish Guru.\" The linked page made alarming claims about ice cream truck kidnappings using chloroform. However, the lack of evidence and specific details casts doubt on the credibility of the rumor.", "Inconsistent images": "The expert highlights that the images used in the post were unrelated to the alleged kidnappings. The image on the left did not involve a Mr. Softee victim, and the photograph on the right was a popular European stock image of an ice cream truck. This discrepancy further undermines the authenticity of the claim."}
