{"Lack of corroborating evidence": "The expert's verdict highlights that despite reaching out to the Seattle Police Department and several neighborhood groups, no one could corroborate the claim of Antifa banging on residents' doors in Seattle and demanding food and supplies.", "Testimonies from neighborhood groups": "Representatives from various neighborhood groups, such as Sustainable Capitol Hill, Capitol Hill Historical Society, Seattle Neighborhood Greenways, and Morgan Junction Association, all denied any knowledge or reports of such disturbances by Antifa in Seattle. Their testimonies provide further evidence against the authenticity of the claim.", "Expert knowledge and opinions": "The expert consulted in the verdict, Tom Heuser (president of the Capitol Hill Historical Society), Gordon Padelford (executive director of Seattle Neighborhood Greenways), and Phillip Tavel (vice president of the Morgan Junction Association), all expressed disbelief and dismissed the claim as baseless. Their expertise and knowledge of the local area lend credibility to their opinions.", "Absence of widespread reports": "The expert mentions that considering the extensive network he has across the city, he would have heard if such incidents were widespread. This emphasizes the lack of widespread reports or evidence supporting the claim, further undermining its authenticity."}
