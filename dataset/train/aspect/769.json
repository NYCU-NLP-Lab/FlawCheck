{"Lack of credible sources": "The expert's verdict highlights that there is no evidence or credible sources to support the claim. A Google search for the chef Mario Dorcy and the existence of a restaurant with a license to serve human flesh in New York yields no results.", "Inconsistencies in the article": "The article itself contains inconsistencies, such as quoting the restaurant owner as a \"4-star Michelin chef\" without any evidence to support this claim. The lack of verifiable information raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Satirical nature of the source": "The expert's investigation reveals that the article was published by Empire News, a known parody website. The website's disclaimer clearly states that their content is intended for entertainment purposes only, and they use fictional names except for public figures or celebrities. This indicates that the claim is likely a satirical or fictional story.", "Reverse image search": "The expert conducted a reverse image search on the picture used in the article, supposedly showing the restaurant owner Mario Dorcy. The search revealed that the image is a stock photo by Wavebreak Media limited, available on the internet since October 2009, long before the article was published. This finding further undermines the credibility of the claim."}
