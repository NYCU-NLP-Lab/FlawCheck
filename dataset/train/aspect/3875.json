{"Different numbers used by Obama and Biden": "The expert's verdict highlights that Obama and Biden have used different income thresholds to promote their tax plans. Obama initially stated that people making less than $250,000 would benefit, while Biden later mentioned that tax relief should only go to those making under $150,000 a year. This discrepancy in numbers raises questions about the consistency of their claims.", "Lack of specificity in tax proposals": "The expert notes that candidates' tax proposals are general outlines and lack the specificity required by actual tax law. This lack of detail can make it confusing for voters to understand the exact impact of the proposed plans and verify the authenticity of the claim.", "Difference between single individuals and couples": "The expert points out that candidates often fail to address the distinction between single individuals and couples when discussing income thresholds and tax credits. While Obama's claim of not raising taxes for those making $250,000 or less may be true for couples, it may not hold for single individuals. This difference in treatment based on marital status adds complexity to the verification process.", "Phase": "out of tax credits: The expert mentions that the Obama campaign has not provided detailed information on how the tax credits offered by Obama phase out as income approaches the $250,000 mark. This lack of transparency makes it difficult to assess the authenticity of the claim and understand the full implications of the proposed tax plan."}
