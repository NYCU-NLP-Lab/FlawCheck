{"The claim is based on an email sent by the ACLU of Florida": "which stated that there are \"13,000 Floridians who have regained the right to vote, but haven't registered to vote because they may not know that they can.\" This aspect verifies the existence of the claim and its source.", "The claim alleges that Governor Rick Scott is not informing these individuals about their restored voting rights": "This aspect verifies the specific accusation made against the governor.", "The expert": "s analysis also mentions that the Florida Parole Commission sent certificates to approximately 89,300 ex-felons between April 2007 and September 2008, informing them that their voting rights had been restored. This aspect provides evidence of a previous effort to inform individuals about their restored voting rights, which contrasts with the claim's accusation against Governor Scott."}
