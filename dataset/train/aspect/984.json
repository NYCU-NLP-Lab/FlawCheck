{"The claim that": "Global surface temperatures have been flat for 16 years\" was contradicted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which reported that 2012 was one of the 10 warmest years on record, and all 10 warmest years have occurred since 1998.", "Over the past 16 years": "1997-2012), 15 of those years have been the warmest on record, indicating a consistent upward trend in global temperatures.", "The difference in global temperature between 1997 and 2012 was 0": "43 degrees Fahrenheit over land and 0.11 degrees over land and water, indicating a measurable increase rather than a flat trend.", "The choice of starting the analysis from 16 years ago": "including the unusually warm year of 1998, may skew the results and mask the overall warming trend. Additionally, when analyzing temperature changes over short time frames, the natural variability of climate can play a significant role, making it difficult to determine a clear trend."}
