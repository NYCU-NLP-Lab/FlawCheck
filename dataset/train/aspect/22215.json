{"The claim states that Ohio U": "S. Rep. Steve Chabot \"voted to cut health care for kids, affecting up to half the families at Cincinnati\u2019s own Children\u2019s Hospital.\" This aspect of the claim is verified by the statement made in the ad released by the House Majority PAC, a group aligned with Democrats, criticizing Chabot's record.", "The expert": "s verdict also mentions that about half of the patients at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center are covered through Medicaid. This information further supports the claim that Chabot's vote could have affected a significant number of families at the hospital.", "Additionally": "the expert's verdict refers to research released by Avalere Health, a healthcare consulting firm, which estimated the potential impact on child health if Medicaid faced the changes laid out in the bill. While the specific number of children that would have been affected is unknown, this research indicates that the claim's assertion of potential harm to children's health care is valid."}
