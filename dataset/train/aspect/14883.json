{"Historical context": "The expert examined historical context to verify the claim that there was a steady reduction in U.S. debt as a percentage of gross domestic product after World War II. They analyzed data and information from the post-World War II period until the 1980s to understand the trend in debt levels.", "Analysis of publicly held debt": "The expert analyzed the level of publicly held debt as a percentage of GDP from 1790 to 2000. They used a Congressional Budget Office table provided by the governor's office to assess the trend in publicly held debt over time.", "Examination of historical tables": "The expert also examined historical tables on the Office of Management and Budget's website to understand how the debt level changed each year between the mid-1940s and the 1980s. This analysis helped to determine the fluctuations in debt as a percentage of GDP during that period.", "Comparison of debt levels": "The expert compared the debt levels at different points in time to assess the claim. They found that the Gross Federal Debt reached its highest point of 121.7 percent of GDP in 1946, after which it gradually declined over 35 years, with some fluctuations. The debt as a percentage of GDP was reported to be 33.2 percent in 1979. This comparison helped to verify the claim of a steady reduction in U.S. debt as a percentage of GDP."}
