{"The photograph was originally taken for the cover of Sports Illustrated in February 1964": "titled \"My $1,000,000 Getaway,\" featuring Muhammad Ali (then Cassius Clay) looking at \"$1 million in cold cash.\"", "The claim that the photograph shows Muhammad Ali with all of his winnings in 1964 is inaccurate and misleading": "as Clay wrote in the accompanying article that he \"will have earned\" $1 million, not that he already had earned it.", "The presence of a man on the opposite side of the vault": "identified as a bank manager or security guard, suggests that the money in the photograph was not Ali's personal wealth but rather being monitored by the bank.", "The authenticity of the money depicted in the photograph is likely genuine": "but it cannot be definitively confirmed whether it belonged to Muhammad Ali or was simply staged for the Sports Illustrated cover."}
