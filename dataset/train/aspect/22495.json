{"The claim is based on a 2013 study conducted by a professor at the University of Chicago": "Illinois, titled \"Insecure Communities: Latino Perceptions of Police Involvement in Immigration Enforcement.\"", "The study surveyed 2": "000 Hispanics, both documented and undocumented, in late 2012 in Phoenix, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Houston.", "One of the survey questions asked respondents to agree or disagree with the statement": "I am less likely to contact police officers if I have been the victim of a crime for fear that they will ask me or people I know about our immigration status.\"", "The study found that overall": "70 percent of undocumented Latinos and 28 percent of U.S.-born Latinos were hesitant to contact the police when they had been the victim of a crime. It also found that more than 40 percent of respondents were less likely to contact police about a crime they knew had taken place."}
