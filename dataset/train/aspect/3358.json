{"Lack of credible sources": "The expert points out that the claim does not provide any credible sources or links to news articles or official statements from President Obama or any relevant government agencies. This lack of verifiable sources raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Inconsistent and unprofessional language": "The expert highlights the use of unprofessional and informal language in the claim, such as \"Everybody babymomma is going to be living in 5-star restaurants now\" and \"Instagram is going to be lit.\" This language undermines the credibility of the claim and suggests a lack of professionalism or factual basis.", "Misunderstanding of executive power": "The expert explains that the claim erroneously assumes that President Obama has the power to pass laws on his own. The expert clarifies that only Congress has the authority to create or pass laws, and the president's role is to enforce and faithfully execute those laws. This aspect reveals a fundamental misunderstanding of how the U.S. government functions.", "Lack of disclaimer and history of spreading falsehoods": "The expert notes that the website publishing the claim, FAMMTV, does not provide any disclaimer indicating that their articles may not be truthful. Additionally, the site has a history of spreading false information, including a previous claim about unemployed \"baby mamas\" being jailed. This aspect highlights the lack of credibility and reliability of the source."}
