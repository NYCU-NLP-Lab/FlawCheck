{"The Under2 MOU has 165 signatories representing a billion people": "which is a significant number and indicates a widespread commitment to the goal of controlling greenhouse gases.", "The Under2 MOU is a voluntary and nonbinding agreement": "meaning that participating countries are not legally obligated to fulfill their commitments. This is a difference compared to the Paris agreement, which includes binding obligations on reporting emissions and progress.", "The Under2 MOU aims to limit carbon emissions to below 80 to 90 percent from 1990 levels": "with the goal of keeping global temperatures from rising 2 degrees Celsius from pre-industrial levels by 2100. This aligns with the same goal and framework of the Paris agreement.", "The Under2 MOU is considered a strong and forceful compact": "but experts highlight that it complements the Paris agreement rather than being its equivalent in terms of potential impact. The two agreements are seen as nested within each other and driving reductions at the subnational level can contribute to achieving national targets."}
