{"The claim is based on a statement made by Republican Dan Sullivan": "s campaign, accusing Sen. Mark Begich of casting the deciding vote in favor of President Obama's authority to issue executive amnesty to illegal aliens.", "The expert": "s analysis reveals that the Senate did not actually vote on a bill addressing Obama's executive amnesty. Instead, they voted on whether or not to kill an amendment that addressed numbering in another amendment.", "It is noted that Begich voted": "no\" on the procedural measure to kill the amendment, which does not necessarily indicate support for executive amnesty. His campaign stated that he opposed the procedural measure because it would have slowed consideration of the primary bill, which he opposed.", "The expert also points out that Begich": "s vote cannot be solely attributed as the \"deciding vote\" since other senators could have been on the fence and influenced the outcome. It is suggested that Begich may have felt pressure to vote both ways as a Democrat running for re-election in a red state."}
