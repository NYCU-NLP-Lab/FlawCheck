{"Logical inconsistencies in the claim": "Users of online forums pointed out that the idea of refugees ordering furniture and weapons seemed implausible, considering their situation of fleeing war-torn regions. This raised doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Analysis of accompanying visuals": "The still frames taken from a mislabeled video were not depicting material being shipped to refugees in Greece or Europe. Instead, they showed embargoed arms being smuggled from Turkey to Libya. This visual analysis contradicted the claim and cast doubt on its authenticity.", "Verification of official reports": "Greek coast guard officials confirmed that they had seized a freighter carrying an undeclared shipment of weapons from Turkey to Libya. This official report provided evidence that the photographs were not related to refugee camps in Europe, further discrediting the claim.", "Confirmation from Turkish authorities": "A spokesperson from the Turkish foreign ministry confirmed that the cargo on the seized freighter included weapons but stated that it was fully documented and destined for the Sudanese police force. This confirmation from Turkish authorities contradicted the claim that the weapons were disguised as furniture and intended for European refugee camps, adding to the doubts about its authenticity."}
