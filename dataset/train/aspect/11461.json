{"The claim falsely states that the incident in 1974 was a school shooting": "when in fact it was a terrorist attack that began on the streets and ended at a school in Ma\u2019alot, Israel. The three Palestinians who carried out the attack were killed in a gun fight with Israeli soldiers, resulting in the death of 21 children.", "There is no evidence to support the claim that Israel requires teachers to have guns": "Israel has strict gun-control laws that specify the professions and purposes for which people can be licensed to possess a gun. Teachers are not included in the list of professions allowed to carry firearms.", "Although Israel does not arm its teachers": "it does require the presence of a security guard at schools with more than 100 students. This requirement was implemented following the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. Regulations from the Israeli Ministry of Education outline the responsibilities of these guards.", "The claim that Israel has only had two school shootings in 44 years": "and both shooters were killed by teachers, is false. The Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs maintains a list of violent incidents since 2000, which includes numerous attacks near schools or school buses involving guns and explosives. Of the two shootings that occurred within school buildings on the list, both were classified as terrorist attacks, resulting in multiple fatalities."}
