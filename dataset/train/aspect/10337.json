{"The top map is not an exhaustive list of every missing person in the United States": "but rather focuses on \"strange\" disappearances near national parks.", "The comparison between the two maps was overstated": "as the data from the bottom map was overlaid on top to make the coincidence seem stronger.", "The original map of missing persons": "created by David Paulides, does not feature the hundreds of black dots shown on the viral map, suggesting that someone overlaid the cave dots onto the missing persons map.", "The similarities between the two maps are not as clean when using Paulides": "original map, indicating that the correlation between missing persons and cave systems is not as strong as initially portrayed."}
