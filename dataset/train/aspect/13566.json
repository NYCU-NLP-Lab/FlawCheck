{"The claim originated from a graphic that was shared online": "showing a picture of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez alongside the quote \"Under capitalism, man oppresses man. Under socialism, it's just the opposite.\"", "The meme containing the quote was spread on a Facebook page associated with musician Ted Nugent": "with the added caption \"Do not shut this woman up. This shit is gold.\"", "Despite attempts to verify the claim": "no record was found of Ocasio-Cortez making such a statement. Furthermore, the phrase itself is a misstated version of a much older phrase attributed to economist John Kenneth Galbraith.", "The original phrase": "Under capitalism man exploits man. Under socialism it's just the opposite,\" has been described as an \"old Soviet joke\" or a \"wry Russian joke\" in various accounts, including a book published in 1977, which was 12 years before Ocasio-Cortez was born."}
