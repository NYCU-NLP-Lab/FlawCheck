{"The claim is based on a statement made by comedian John Oliver": "who mentioned that 28 percent of Kentuckians don't have any online access.", "The National Broadband Map": "which collects data on broadband availability, reports that 94.4 percent of people in Kentucky have access to at least Internet speeds of 3 megabits per second.", "Census data suggests that some people choose not to connect to the Internet": "either because they don't want it or don't think they need it. This could affect the percentage of people with online access in Kentucky.", "The cost of Internet access and the availability of computers could also be factors contributing to the percentage of Kentuckians without online access": "with 28 percent citing cost as prohibitive and 13 percent stating they don't have a computer at all."}
