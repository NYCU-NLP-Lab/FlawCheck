{"The claim states that": "caravans\" of people from Central America are coming to the Southwest border and that Mexico \"must stop them.\" The expert's verdict refutes this claim by stating that there is no evidence of large flows of people entering the U.S. from Mexico to take advantage of DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals), a program started in 2012 by President Barack Obama.", "The expert": "s verdict mentions that DHS statistics indicate a sharp rise in the number of individuals detained after being apprehended at the border under Trump's administration, even as border apprehensions declined. This aspect contradicts the claim's implication that border patrol agents are not allowed to properly do their job at the border."}
