Furthermore, only six states offer programs that cover the full cost of tuition or fill in the gap between what students can pay and the remaining tuition costs, regardless of legal status. The eligibility requirements for these programs vary.", "The expert": "s verdict highlights the misleading nature of the claim, as it inaccurately compares the college admissions bribery scandal with the cost of college for immigrants in the United States illegally.
