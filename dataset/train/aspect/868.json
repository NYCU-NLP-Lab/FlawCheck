{"The image used in the claim is actually a scene from a Bhojpuri movie titled": "Aurat Khilona Nahin\" released in 2014. This can be verified by comparing the image with a still from the movie found in a blog post from 2014.", "There is no prominent BSP leader named": "Bakruddin Ansari' as mentioned in the claim. This can be confirmed by conducting a search for prominent BSP leaders and their names.", "The same image was debunked by Alt News in July 2017 when it was circulated with a different false claim during riots in Basirhat": "West Bengal. This indicates that the image has been used in the past to spread misinformation.", "The individuals who initially shared the claim": "Rajneesh Bharara and Namo Narayan Hindu, have not deleted their posts despite being informed multiple times about the falsity of their claim. This suggests a disregard for accuracy and a potential intention to spread misinformation."}
