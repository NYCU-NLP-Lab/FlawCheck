{"The claim was based on a blog post from Bare Naked Islam": "which has since been deleted, that alleged Target stores were designating specific lanes as pork- and alcohol-free to accommodate Muslim employees.", "A reverse image search revealed that the photograph used in the claim had been previously published by a similar website": "but it was associated with a different story about a Muslim offense avoidance checkout line at a Wegmans store in 2012, not a new policy implemented by Target in 2015.", "The claim falsely attributed a": "new policy\" to Target and stated that it was confirmed by a Target spokesperson. However, the spokesperson's statement was taken out of context from a 2007 article that discussed Target's accommodation of Muslim employees by assigning them to positions other than checkout lanes, not by placing signs at registers.", "Target offered alternative solutions to Muslim cashiers who objected to handling pork": "such as wearing gloves while cashiering, shifting to other positions, or transferring to nearby stores. This information contradicts the claim that Target implemented a chain-wide policy of directing customers purchasing certain products to choose different lanes."}
