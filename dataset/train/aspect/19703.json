Supreme Court ruling on campaign donation limits: The expert mentions that the court's decision on April 2 allows a single donor to give to multiple candidates, party funds, and political action committees, effectively removing a key campaign donation limit. This aspect verifies the claim by highlighting the change in regulations regarding campaign donations.", "Previous overall cap on campaign donations": "The expert states that before the court's ruling, there was an overall cap of $123,200 on campaign donations. This information helps provide context and supports the claim by showing the previous restrictions on campaign contributions.", "Data from the Center for Responsive Politics": "The expert mentions that the Center for Responsive Politics has been tracking federal campaign donations for many years. According to their latest data, 366,000 people have given $200 or more in the 2013-14 election cycle. This aspect provides empirical evidence to verify the claim by presenting actual numbers of individuals who have made significant campaign contributions.", "Percentage of Americans giving over": "200 to political campaigns: The expert mentions different percentages related to the claim. While McGhee initially states that less than 1 percent of 1 percent of the American population has given an amount over $200, the expert corrects this to 0.12% of the population. This aspect provides a specific percentage to support the claim and highlights the relatively small number of Americans contributing over $200 in an election cycle."}
