{"The claim made by InfoWars that": "Joe Biden\u2019s Dept. of Energy Blocked Texas from Increasing Power Ahead of Killer Storm\" is false.", "The Energy Department did not block Texas from increasing power production before the winter storm hit": "3. The emergency order cited by InfoWars actually temporarily suspended federal emissions caps in the state so that some power plants could operate at maximum capacity.", "ERCOT": "the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, requested emergency assistance from the government to allow Texas power plants to exceed federal emissions requirements until Feb. 19 in order to ensure reliability during the severe winter storm."}
