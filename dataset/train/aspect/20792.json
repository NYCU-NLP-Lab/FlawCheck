{"The expert analyzed the TV commercial endorsing Issue 2": "which featured Toledo Mayor Mike Bell stating that he lost his job as a firefighter because the city ran out of money. This commercial was made and paid for by Building a Better Ohio, a political action committee supporting SB 5, a law that restricts the collective bargaining power of Ohio's public unions.", "The expert researched Mike Bell": "s background and experience to determine his credibility. Bell served as a firefighter and certified paramedic, becoming Toledo's youngest-ever and first African American fire chief. He held this position for over 16 years before retiring and being appointed as State Fire Marshal by then-Governor Ted Strickland.", "The expert investigated the circumstances surrounding the layoffs of Toledo firefighters and city workers in 1980": "which included Mike Bell. The layoffs were a result of a budget crisis, and three fire stations were closed. However, these layoffs occurred more than three years before the current collective bargaining law (SB 5) took effect, raising questions about the relevance of Bell's statement in the TV commercial.", "The expert examined historical accounts from The Toledo Blade regarding the 1980 layoffs and the events leading up to them": "The layoffs followed an impasse in negotiations between the city and unions, which resulted in a strike by municipal employees, including police and firefighters. The Ferguson Act prohibited strikes by public employees in Ohio and allowed for the dismissal of strikers. The strike led to a 48-hour gap in public safety, with residents arming themselves and numerous fires being set. The budget crisis was eventually resolved in 1982 when voters approved a temporary increase in the income tax."}
