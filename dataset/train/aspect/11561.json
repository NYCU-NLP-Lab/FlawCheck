{"Online records of lobbyists filed with the City of Chicago Board of Ethics show that Endy Zemenides and his law firm were registered as lobbyists for BP Bovis Global Alliance from 2003 to 2007": "2. Giannoulias spokesman Matt McGrath argues that Zemenides was a real estate attorney for BP Bovis Global Alliance, not a lobbyist. McGrath states that Zemenides helped the company on landscaping and zoning issues as they converted Amoco stations to BP gas stations in the Chicago area.", "McGrath explains that it is the policy of the City of Chicago for real estate attorneys handling zoning cases to register as lobbyists": "even though their work is not directly related to lobbying.", "The Illinois Republican Party website mocks the response from the Giannoulias campaign": "sarcastically questioning when a BP lobbyist is not actually a BP lobbyist. They argue that in the real world, Zemenides was a registered BP lobbyist and that BP gas stations are indeed connected to BP, regardless of the specific tasks involved in Zemenides' work."}
