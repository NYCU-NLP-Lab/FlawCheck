Some conservatives argue that Kavanaugh's opinion showed that the individual mandate of the ACA is unconstitutional, while others believe that Kavanaugh was giving instructions to Congress on how to ensure the mandate meets constitutional muster.", "Legal scholars": "assessment: The expert's verdict includes the opinions of legal scholars who were reached for their assessment of Kavanaugh's stance on the ACA. The scholars mentioned that they do not discern overall leanings from Kavanaugh's 2011 case or a second case in 2015, suggesting that it is difficult to determine Kavanaugh's attitude toward the ACA based solely on those cases.", "Lack of evidence for Kavanaugh being": "pro-Obamacare\": The expert's verdict includes statements from health care law professors who state that they do not see any particular leaning on Obamacare based on Kavanaugh's 2011 case or the larger framework of the ACA.
