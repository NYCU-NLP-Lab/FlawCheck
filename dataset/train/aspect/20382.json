{"The expert verified the claim by examining the Government Printing Office synopsis of the June 14": "2011 Federal Register, which showed that the Federal Register at the end of that day was 34,844 pages, close to what the claim stated.", "The expert also confirmed that the size of the Federal Register increases each business day": "with each daily edition being a couple hundred pages. In 2010, the register totaled 81,405 pages.", "The expert found that the weight of the Federal Register had not been measured directly": "but Rep. Forbes' spokesman provided a formula based on the weight of a 500-sheet ream of standard office paper (5 pounds per ream). Using this formula, the expert calculated that the 34,000 pages of the Federal Register would weigh more than 340 pounds.", "Additionally": "the expert highlighted the role and purpose of the Federal Register as a resource for lawyers, journalists, and special interest groups to keep track of regulations. U.S. agencies use it to publish proposed regulations and solicit public comments."}
