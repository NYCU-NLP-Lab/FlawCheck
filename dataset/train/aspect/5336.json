{"Comparison of data sources": "The expert evaluated the claim by examining the data sources used by Sen. Ron Johnson, specifically the statistics from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), which measures economic growth.", "Time period comparison": "The expert noted that Sen. Johnson's claim compared the final two years of the Obama administration (2015 and 2016) to a little over the first two years of the Trump administration, which could be seen as cherry-picking the data. The expert analyzed the data for a more comprehensive comparison of business investment growth under both presidents.", "Adjustments in data": "The expert highlighted that the BEA updated the data shortly after Sen. Johnson made the claim, resulting in slight adjustments to some quarters' figures. However, the overall trend remained largely the same. The expert considered the impact of these adjustments on the authenticity of the claim.", "Overall growth comparison": "The expert compared the average business investment growth rate under the full eight years of the Obama administration to the growth rate under the Trump administration up to the latest available data. This comparison provided a broader perspective on the claim and the relative performance of the two presidents in terms of business investment growth."}
