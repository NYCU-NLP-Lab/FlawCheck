{"Toomey": "s explanation for the claim: The expert examined Senator Toomey's explanation for the statement, which included multiple examples of incidents where immigrants wanted by ICE were released and went on to commit violent crimes. These examples, such as the murder of Kate Steinle in San Francisco and Marilyn Pharis in Southern California, were presented as evidence of the danger posed by sanctuary cities.", "Testimonials from law enforcement officials": "To verify the claim, Toomey's staff had two officials affiliated with law enforcement send emails advocating for the Senator's claim. These testimonials were likely used to add credibility to the argument that sanctuary policies interfere with ICE's ability to prevent future crimes.", "Reference to a report by the Center for Immigration Studies": "The expert mentioned that Toomey's staff reached out to the Center for Immigration Studies, an organization critical of sanctuary policies. Jessica Vaughan, the director of policy studies for the Center, referred to her report tracking 8,000 people released despite ICE detainer requests. The report allegedly found that about 25 percent of these individuals went on to commit future crimes, suggesting that sanctuary policies hinder ICE from doing its job.", "Lack of conclusive studies": "Despite the anecdotes and the Center for Immigration Studies' report, the expert noted that no conclusive study has shown higher crime rates as a result of sanctuary city policies. This suggests that there may be a lack of empirical evidence supporting the claim that sanctuary cities are \"extremely dangerous.\""}
