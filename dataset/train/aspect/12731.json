["\"Texas is one of the most gerrymandered states in the union,\" O\u2019Rourke\n   said during the episode.", "\"By most objective statistical or mathematical measures, Texas is one of\n   the most gerrymandered states in the U.S.,\" said Daniel McGlone, a senior\n   analyst with Azavea, a Philadelphia-based firm that has studied\n   congressional district line-drawing.", "But studies that look at the intersection of\n   geographical compactness and partisan voting history consistently place\n   Texas between fifth and seventh on the list of most gerrymandered states\n   in the nation.", "Since O\u2019Rourke called Texas \"one of the most\" gerrymandered\n   states, such studies support his point."]
