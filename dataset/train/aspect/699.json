{"The expert": "s verdict highlights the filing of a brief by the U.S. Justice Department on June 7, which aimed to overturn guaranteed coverage for pre-existing conditions in the Affordable Care Act. This action by the department is seen as the basis for the claim made by Jacky Rosen, a Nevada Democratic Senate candidate, against Republican incumbent Dean Heller.", "The claim asserts that Dean Heller helped": "craft a partisan repeal bill that also would have slashed coverage protections for people with pre-existing conditions.\" The expert's verdict confirms that Heller was indeed an original co-sponsor of the 2017 Graham-Cassidy bill, which aimed to turn federal health care programs into block grants to states. However, it is noted that the bill never came up for a vote.", "The Heller campaign disputes Rosen": "s characterization of the health care bill and argues that Graham-Cassidy left the current law on pre-existing conditions untouched. Heller's team emphasizes that insurance companies would still be prohibited from denying coverage based on pre-existing conditions and that patients would still be able to renew their coverage regardless of their health.", "The ambiguity lies in the bill": "s rules for state waivers from Affordable Care Act regulations. While the bill maintains access to adequate and affordable health insurance coverage for individuals with pre-existing conditions, it also grants states the power to allow insurance companies to charge sick people more than healthy ones. This waiver would remove the current limits on premiums and the restriction on charging older individuals more than three times what younger individuals are charged."}
