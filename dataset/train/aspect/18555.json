{"Reference to a specific source": "The expert's verdict mentions that U.S. Rep. Chris Smith's claim about the number of abortions is based on a report from the National Right to Life Committee. This specific source is cited as the basis for verifying the authenticity of the claim.", "Use of data from a reputable research group": "The National Right to Life Committee's total number of abortions is stated to be based on data collected by the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that is considered the authority for this type of data by both sides of the abortion debate. The use of data from a reputable research group adds credibility to the claim.", "Comparison with alternative data sources": "The expert's verdict mentions that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also collect data on abortions, but the numbers are incomplete in some years because states are not required to report to the federal agency. By comparing the data from the Guttmacher Institute with the alternative data sources, it helps validate the claim's authenticity.", "Reasonable estimation": "The National Right to Life Committee estimates the total number of abortions through 2011 by assuming that the number of abortions in 2008 stayed the same. This estimation is considered reasonable by a spokesperson for the Guttmacher Institute. The use of a reasonable estimation adds another aspect to verify the authenticity of the claim."}
