{"The claim was analyzed based on the information provided in the Facebook post": "which stated that workers employed by Mamata Banerjee attacked a group of Hindus at a rally for India's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).", "The authenticity of the claim was verified by examining other online posts carrying the same images and making the same claim": "such as on Twitter.", "The photographs used in the misleading Facebook post were found to be taken at two different protests": "one in Lucknow in November 2018 and another at a school near Kolkata following sexual assault allegations in October 2018. This discrepancy in the location of the events contradicted the claim made in the Facebook post.", "The photographer": "Ashutosh Tripathi, confirmed that the images were taken at the Lucknow protests and were being misused as fake images in the misleading Facebook post. Tripathi's original images were shared on his own Facebook page and appeared in local media reports, tweets by journalists, and posts by Indian opposition leaders."}
