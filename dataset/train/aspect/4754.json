{"Comparison of photographs": "The expert analyzed two photographs of the Jammu and Kashmir civil secretariat building. The top image showed both the Indian flag and the flag of J&K hoisted on the building, while the bottom image showed only the Indian flag. This comparison helped verify the claim.", "Verification through other sources": "The expert conducted a Google reverse-image search and found a 2016 article in Kashmir News Observer that carried the same image. Additionally, a recent image of the civil secretariat building with the state flag visible was published in a report by Dainik Jagran. These independent sources further supported the authenticity verification.", "Testimony of credible individuals": "The expert noted that BJP Kashmir spokesperson Altaf Thakur, as well as associate editor Neeraj Rajput from ABP News, had shared images of the civil secretariat building where both the Indian flag and the J&K flag were visible. Their testimonies provided additional evidence against the claim.", "Analysis of surrounding elements": "The expert observed that, apart from the flags, there were no differences in the surroundings of the building in the two photographs. The placement of cars and people walking around was exactly the same in both images. This analysis indicated that the claim was likely based on a photoshopped image and further discredited its authenticity."}
