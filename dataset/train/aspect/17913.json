{"Multiple news sites published the video": "The fact that the video was published by reputable news sites such as the Daily Mail, the Sun, and the Metro adds credibility to the claim. These sites are known for their fact-checking processes and are unlikely to publish false information without verifying its authenticity.", "Graphic video evidence": "The video allegedly shows Alexander being treated at a hospital after his ordeal. The graphic nature of the video, which may not be suitable for all audiences, suggests that it could be genuine footage of a man who suffered a bear attack and survived.", "Eyewitness testimonies": "The claim includes testimonies from Alexander himself, who reportedly told the hunters that he survived the bear attack and was preserved as food. Additionally, the video was said to have been received from a friend of a friend of a friend who claimed to know an eyewitness to the incident. While these testimonies are not first-person accounts, they provide some level of corroboration to the claim.", "Circulation on Russian messaging apps": "Before the video made it to British tabloids, it circulated on Russian messaging apps with various stories. This suggests that the video had been shared among individuals in Russia, adding to its potential authenticity. However, it is important to note that the stories circulating on these apps were equally outlandish and unbelievable, indicating a lack of concrete evidence to support the claim."}
