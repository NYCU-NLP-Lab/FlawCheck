{"Clinton": "s claim is supported by her performance in three key states: Ohio, Massachusetts, and California. Exit polls from these states show that she competed well with Obama for voters under 30 years old in two out of three states.", "In California": "Clinton and Obama tied at 49 percent each among young voters. In Massachusetts, Clinton won 49 percent while Obama won 48 percent. In Ohio, Clinton won 35 percent and Obama won 61 percent.", "Among voters under 25": "Clinton performed better in California and Massachusetts but fared worse in Ohio. In California, she won 50 percent compared to Obama's 48 percent. In Massachusetts, she won 57 percent while Obama took 39 percent. In Ohio, Clinton won 29 percent while Obama won 70 percent.", "The sample sizes for voters under 25 in these three states were small": "with only about 100 people each, making the results less reliable. However, Joe Lenski, an expert in exit polls, agreed with Clinton's claim that she did well with young voters in Massachusetts and California, where she split the vote with Obama. Lenski also noted that Clinton won even more youth votes in Oklahoma and Arkansas, but these states were not highlighted as they are not considered core Democratic states like California and Massachusetts."}
