{"President Donald Trump": "s statement: President Trump himself stated that the Graham-Cassidy health care bill includes coverage of pre-existing conditions. This is a direct claim from the highest authority involved in the bill's development.", "The bill": "s rules for state waivers: The bill includes provisions that allow states to obtain waivers from certain regulations in the Affordable Care Act. However, in order to be granted a waiver, the state must demonstrate its intention to maintain access to adequate and affordable health insurance coverage for individuals with pre-existing conditions. This aspect verifies that the bill aims to include coverage for pre-existing conditions.", "Removal of current limits": "The bill removes current limits set by the Affordable Care Act on insurance premiums. Under the current rules, insurance companies cannot charge higher premiums based on an individual's health status. However, the Graham-Cassidy bill allows states to waive these limits, potentially enabling insurance companies to charge sick people more than healthy individuals. This aspect raises concerns about the extent of coverage for pre-existing conditions.", "Funding cuts and state responsibility": "The bill's impact on funding is another aspect to consider. According to health consulting firm Avalere and the Kaiser Family Foundation, many states would experience net funding cuts under the Graham-Cassidy bill. Covering individuals with pre-existing conditions requires financial resources, and these funding reductions may affect the ability of states to adequately provide coverage. Additionally, the bill removes Affordable Care Act regulations that spread some of the costs across the private sector, placing the responsibility on states to make up the difference. This aspect highlights potential challenges in ensuring comprehensive coverage for pre-existing conditions."}
