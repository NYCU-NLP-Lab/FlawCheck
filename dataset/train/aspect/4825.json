{"Lack of reliable mainstream news sources reporting the claim": "The expert mentions that no reputable news sources have reported on the claim that Johnny Depp will be charged with conspiracy to assassinate the president. This suggests that the claim may not be authentic.", "Depp": "s ill-conceived comment and subsequent apology: The expert mentions that the claim was inspired by a comment Depp made during a public appearance in England, for which he later apologized. This indicates that the claim may have been exaggerated or fabricated based on a misunderstanding of Depp's statement.", "Secret Service": "s stance on threats against the president: The expert highlights the Secret Service's role in monitoring and following up on threats against the president. They mention that artists are generally granted license under the First Amendment to express controversial statements without legal consequences, as long as there is no genuine intent to harm. This suggests that the claim may not hold true, as Depp's statement may not have constituted a genuine threat.", "Comparison to other similar cases": "The expert mentions other cases involving artists like rapper Snoop Dogg and comedian Kathy Griffin, who made controversial statements or actions against President Trump. By drawing a parallel, the expert implies that if there were genuine grounds to charge Depp, it would be consistent with how such cases have been handled in the past.
