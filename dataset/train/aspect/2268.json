{"The video was published on Facebook on May 20": "2020, with a caption stating \"Hatton Colombo road at Diyagala please be careful and safe\". This provided initial information about the claim and its context.", "The Hatton": "Colombo road was identified as a major road in Sri Lanka that connects Hatton with Colombo. This information helped to establish the location mentioned in the claim.", "A reverse image search using InVID": "WeVerify, a digital verification tool, found that the video appeared in an April 9, 2020 report by Indonesian media outlet Tribunnews. The report described a landslide in Cianjur, West Java province, Indonesia. This evidence contradicted the claim about the video showing a landslide in Sri Lanka.", "The video was also shared on Facebook with a similar claim about it showing a landslide": "This additional sharing of the video reinforced the false claim and further supported the expert's verdict that the claim was not authentic."}
