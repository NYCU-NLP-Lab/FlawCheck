{"Loeffler": "s political contributions since 2006, which total over $2 million, show that only $16,600 has gone to Democrats or liberal causes, while the rest has been donated to Republicans and conservative causes.", "The relatively small amount of money Loeffler has given to Democrats does not necessarily indicate support for abortion rights": "3. Loeffler has made campaign contributions to Democrats who support abortion rights, but the majority of her campaign cash has been given to Republicans, and she has been endorsed by major anti-abortion groups.", "The claim made by Rep": "Doug Collins that Loeffler has a \"long history of donating to abortion-on-demand Democrats\" is partially supported by the fact that Loeffler made donations to Democrats who support abortion rights, but it is important to note that these donations were made several years ago and there is no indication that they were specifically based on the lawmakers' stances on abortion."}
