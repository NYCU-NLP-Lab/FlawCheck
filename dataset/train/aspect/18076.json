{"The expert": "s verdict mentions that some doctors claim that Ebola can be transmitted through the air by a sneeze or cough. This claim is being fact-checked to verify its authenticity.", "The expert refers to an interview with George F": "Will on Fox News Sunday, where he stated that there are doctors who believe that airborne particles from a sneeze or cough can transmit Ebola.", "The expert investigates the source of Will": "s information and finds that he referenced a commentary from two University of Illinois professors, Lisa Brosseau and Rachel Jones, published by the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy. This commentary argued that health care workers treating Ebola patients should wear respirators due to concerns about aerosols generated by infected patients in severe stages of the disease.", "The expert reaches out to Lisa Brosseau": "one of the authors of the commentary, who clarifies that their focus was on the risk to health care workers in isolation wards, not on the general public. Brosseau mentions that water particles from violent vomiting and diarrhea could potentially be inhaled in a laboratory experiment, but this does not directly support the claim that Ebola can be transmitted through a sneeze or cough in public settings."}
