{"The expert referred to a biennial report from the state comptroller": "s office on tax burdens in Texas, which provided data on the amount of taxes paid by businesses and consumers. This report included projections for various taxes such as franchise taxes, oil production taxes, school property taxes, and state sales taxes.", "The expert analyzed the specific taxes mentioned in the report and identified that franchise and oil production taxes were initially paid entirely by businesses": "while the cigarette tax was paid entirely by consumers. The remaining taxes were shared between consumers and businesses.", "The expert calculated the estimated burden imposed by each tax category for businesses and consumers separately": "The total tax burden for businesses was determined to be $28.2 billion, while for consumers it was $27.5 billion. This analysis provided a quantitative comparison of the tax payments made by businesses and individuals.", "The expert also mentioned that previous tax": "incidence reports from the comptroller's office showed slightly greater tax burdens for businesses compared to individuals, but the differences were due to the inclusion or exclusion of specific taxes such as natural gas tax, cigarette tax, and oil production tax. This comparison highlighted the consistency of the findings across different reports and time periods."}
