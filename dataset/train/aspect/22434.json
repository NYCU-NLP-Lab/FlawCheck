{"Investigation of a rumor": "The expert mentions that they investigated a rumor in February 2019 that U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff used taxpayer money to settle a sexual harassment claim in 2013. They clarify that this rumor was entirely false and based on a junk news article that cited a non-existent report from the Los Angeles Times.", "Devious twist on false claim": "The expert explains that social media users added a devious twist to the false claim when Schiff started holding public hearings in the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump. They circulated an old photograph of Schiff with a child on Facebook, claiming that Schiff was a known pedophile who had settled numerous sex crime cases out of court.", "Lack of evidence": "The expert states that there is no truth to the claim and those spreading the rumor have provided no evidence to support it. They mention that when they looked it up, the only thing they found was a months-old junk news article that they had already debunked.", "Authenticity of the photograph": "The expert acknowledges that the photograph circulating on social media is real but has been severely degraded to make it look old and suspicious. They clarify that the photograph was not uncovered during an investigation into the alleged crimes but was shared by Schiff himself in 2017, showing him with his \"little brother David\" from the Big Brothers Big Sisters program. They also highlight that the person in the photograph, David McMillan, has never accused Schiff of any inappropriate behavior and has even responded positively to the image shared by Schiff."}
