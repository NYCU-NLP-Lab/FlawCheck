{"The claim states that Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele balanced the budget without raising taxes for five consecutive years": "2. The expert's verdict highlights that the county Board of Supervisors has generally raised property taxes while making changes to Abele's budgets.", "The expert points out that although Abele proposed a property tax levy freeze for each of his five budgets": "the proposed levy actually increased every year, with a difference of $13 million between 2012 and 2016.", "It is mentioned that Abele took advantage of the fact that the County Board adopted a levy higher than his proposed amount": "and the \"freeze\" he proposed was on the higher amount adopted by the board, not the lower amount he had initially suggested."}
