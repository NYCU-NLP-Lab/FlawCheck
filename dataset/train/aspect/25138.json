{"Comparison with historical data": "The expert compared the claim about having more women in the workforce than ever before with historical data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. They looked at the annual average for 2018 and found that it was indeed the highest recorded number of women in the labor force.", "Evaluation of the claim": "s context: The expert pointed out that simply counting the number of women in the workforce is not a meaningful measure because it is influenced by population growth. They explained that the overall number of women in the US is rising, so it is expected that the number of women participating in the labor force would also increase.", "Examination of the percentage of women in the workforce": "The expert argued that a better measurement is to look at the percentage of women who are in the workforce from year to year. They stated that by this measurement, women's participation in the workforce peaked in 1999 at around 60 percent and has been declining since then.", "Corroboration from a reputable source": "The expert mentioned that the claim about having a record number of women in Congress was accurate according to the Pew Research Center. This corroborates the idea that there is an increase in women's representation in political positions, but it does not necessarily imply a record high in women's workforce participation."}
