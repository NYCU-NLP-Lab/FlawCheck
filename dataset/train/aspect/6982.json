{"The claim states that drivers will receive guaranteed earnings": "health care benefits, personal protections, and maintain flexible schedules.", "Detractors argue that Proposition 22 would strip drivers of the protections provided by AB": "5, a California law that classifies drivers as employees and grants them benefits such as paid sick leave, workers' compensation, and access to unemployment insurance.", "Supporters of Proposition 22": "including ride-sharing companies and the California Chamber of Commerce, argue that it would provide drivers with benefits such as a guarantee of minimum earnings and compensation for on-the-job injuries, while allowing them to remain independent contractors with flexible schedules.", "The truth regarding health care benefits under Proposition 22 is that drivers who qualify would receive a stipend to purchase an insurance plan through Covered California": "the state's health insurance marketplace. The stipend provided by the companies would be 82% of the average premium cost, and drivers would be eligible for the full stipend if they work an average of 37.5 hours per week for a single company."}
