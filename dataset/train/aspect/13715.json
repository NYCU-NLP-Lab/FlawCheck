{"Unemployment rate": "The expert mentions that the unemployment rate under Trump reached levels not seen since the early 1950s and was the lowest peacetime unemployment rate over a three-year period. This is considered strong evidence for Trump's claim.", "GDP growth": "The expert points out that growth in gross domestic product (GDP) under Trump was below his pledge of 4% and well below that of prior presidents. The annual increases in GDP were similar to the final six years under Obama, indicating that it was not the best in the nation's history.", "GDP per capita": "When adjusting GDP to account for population, the expert states that the inflation-adjusted GDP per capita increased 1.9% annually under Trump, which is average compared to his predecessors. This suggests that the economy was not exceptional in terms of per capita income.", "Other metrics": "The expert mentions that metrics such as wages and business investment ranged from decent to mediocre under Trump. While wages continued to increase under his administration, they were not significantly different from the trend during the Obama years. This casts doubt on the overall strength and exceptionalism of the economy."}
