{"The photograph originated from a Vietnamese news site": "Emdep, and was part of a larger set of photographs depicting a volunteer washing the remains of aborted fetuses, stillborn births, and/or premature or abandoned infants in preparation for burial.", "The practice of washing and burying aborted fetuses is consistent with cultural and religious practices in Vietnam": "as described in the Vietnamese news report.", "Vietnam has one of the highest abortion rates in the world": "with official reports estimating between 250,000 and 300,000 abortions completed every year, and the actual number believed to be much higher, including illegal procedures.", "The ceremony described in the Vietnamese news report": "where volunteers hold a burial every two weeks at a cemetery in Doi Coc, further supports the authenticity of the claim."}
