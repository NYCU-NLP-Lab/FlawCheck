{"Lack of evidence": "The claim lacks evidence to support the assertion that President Obama granted U.S. citizenship to 2,500 Iranians as part of the Iran nuclear agreement. Factnameh.com, a Canada-based fact-checking website, found no evidence backing up the claim made by an Iranian official.", "Original source of the claim": "The original source of the claim was an anti-regime website called Amad News, which published the claim on February 14, 2017. The source quoted an anonymous \"informed source,\" raising questions about the credibility of the claim.", "Attribution to Iranian official": "The claim was attributed to Hojjat al-Islam Mojtaba Zolnour, chairman of Iran's parliamentary nuclear committee and a member of its national security and foreign affairs committee. Zolnour made the allegations during an interview with Iran's Etemad newspaper, cited by the country's Fars News agency. However, the reliability of the source and the credibility of the official's claims are questionable.", "Expert dismissal": "Richard Nephew, a sanctions expert who worked for the State Department, dismissed the claim as \"entirely nonsense.\" He stated that during his time on the team, granting citizenship to Iranians as a favor was not discussed, considered, or thought about. Nephew's expertise adds weight to the dismissal of the claim's authenticity."}
