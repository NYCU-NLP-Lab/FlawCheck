{"The expert": "s verdict is based on a comparison between the definition of a \"spill\" and the incidents mentioned in the claim. The expert argues that the claim includes incidents that may not fit the definition of a spill, such as the chemical storage facility leak in West Virginia.", "The expert verifies the claim by referring to a July 2013 investigation by EnergyWire": "which provides data on reported spills and mishaps at onshore oil and gas sites in 2012. This investigation was conducted by reporter Mike Soraghan over a period of four months.", "The expert mentions that Soraghan compiled data from 16 oil states using computer": "assisted reporting methods since there is no central, uniform reporting system for companies to report oil and gas leaks at onshore drilling sites. This highlights the effort made to gather accurate information despite the lack of a standardized reporting system.", "The expert provides information from the EnergyWire report": "which states that in 2012, there were more than 6,000 reported spills and mishaps at onshore oil and gas sites, averaging more than 16 spills a day. The report also mentions that these incidents resulted in at least 15.6 million gallons of various liquids being spilled, including oil, fracking fluid, and contaminated wastewater."}
