{"The expert mentioned the specific claim made by Jerry Henry": "executive director of GeorgiaCarry.org, that more than 440 people have been killed in attacks on church property since 1999.", "The expert highlighted that Jerry Henry relied on two specific websites": "Cops and Cross and Carl Chinn's church security site, for the statistic. These websites provide information on violent deaths on church and faith-based property since 1999.", "The expert mentioned that Cops and Cross": "run by Jimmy Meeks, listed more than 470 \"violent deaths on church and faith-based property since 1999,\" but did not include sources for those figures. Instead, it directed users to Carl Chinn's site.", "The expert noted that Carl Chinn relies on news reports": "official records, and blog items for his figures on violent deaths on church property. However, it was mentioned that Chinn's count includes broad incidents not likely to be considered attacks, such as suicides on church property that are not connected to the house of worship."}
