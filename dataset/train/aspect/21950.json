{"The expert reviewed multiple polls conducted in New Jersey on same": "sex marriage, including the Rutgers-Eagleton poll and the Quinnipiac Polling Institute's poll, to assess the level of support for marriage equality. These polls provided data on the percentage of registered voters who were in favor of or opposed to same-sex marriage.", "The expert highlighted that the highest level of support for same": "sex marriage ever polled in New Jersey was around 64 percent, as reported by the Quinnipiac Polling Institute. This contradicts the claim of 70 percent support made by Senate President Steve Sweeney.", "The expert emphasized that when voters were asked if same": "sex marriage should go on the ballot, support for it was around 70 percent. However, when voters were asked if they would support laws allowing same-sex marriage, favorability dropped to around 60 percent. This distinction was crucial in verifying the accuracy of the claim.", "The expert mentioned the Monmouth University Poll": "which also indicated increasing support for same-sex marriage in recent years, reaching a solid majority of around 60 percent.
