{"The claim refers to the Affordable Care Act imposing a penalty or tax on employers for every new job they create": "2. The expert's verdict highlights that the penalty or tax mentioned in the claim is related to the employer mandate provision of the law, which levies a penalty on employers who fail to offer health insurance to workers.", "The expert points out that the penalty only applies to companies with at least 100 workers": "and companies with 50-99 workers have an additional year before the penalty applies.", "The expert cites data from the Kaiser Family Foundation and the U": "S. Census Bureau to show that the claim's assertion of \"every new job\" being subject to the penalty is an exaggeration, as the majority of larger businesses already offer health insurance and the rule is not intended to apply to small businesses with fewer than 50 workers."}
