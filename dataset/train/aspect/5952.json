{"Comparison to historical temperature records": "The expert compared the claimed temperature of 62\u00b0C in Kuwait to the highest temperature ever recorded, which was 56.7\u00b0C in Furnace Creek, California in 1913. This comparison revealed that the claimed temperature was higher than any recorded temperature in history, casting doubt on its authenticity.", "Analysis of weather data": "The expert mentioned that the weather in Kuwait during July 2017 hovered around 50\u00b0C, which contradicts the claim of a temperature of 62\u00b0C. By analyzing available weather data, the expert was able to verify that the claimed temperature was inconsistent with the actual weather conditions during that time.", "Examination of video evidence": "The expert noted that videos and images were shared on social media showing burning trees and melting streetlights. However, they concluded that the footage of the burning trees was likely real, but the claim that these fires were caused by 62\u00b0C temperatures was unfounded. By scrutinizing the video evidence, the expert was able to determine that the footage did not support the authenticity of the claim.", "Verification of location": "The expert mentioned that one of the popular videos supporting the claim was actually shot in Madinah, Saudi Arabia, not in Kuwait. By cross-referencing the video with reliable sources and reports, the expert was able to identify that the location of the video did not align with the claim being made. This discrepancy in location further undermined the authenticity of the claim."}
