{"The claim was based on an erroneous interpretation of an amendment to the 1963 Presidential Transition Act": "which outlines requirements for the General Services Administration (GSA) during presidential transitions.", "The amendment in question": "proposed by Republican Sen. Ron Johnson in February 2019 and passed into law in March 2020, clarified the GSA's role and established new conditions for presidential candidates before Election Day.", "The amendment did not grant outgoing presidents control over the armed forces after Inauguration Day": "It primarily focused on the GSA's provision of services and facilities to outgoing administrations and their staff during the transition period.", "The GSA": "s website clearly states the services and facilities it provides during transitions, which include space, communication systems, IT support, financial management, human resources management, telephones, parking, furniture, vehicles, office equipment, mail management, and administrative support services."}
