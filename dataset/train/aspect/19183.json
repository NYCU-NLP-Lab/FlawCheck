{"False reports and rumors": "The expert's verdict highlights that false reports and rumors circulated on social media, claiming that San Juan mayor Carmen Yul\u00edn Cruz was arrested for misusing federal disaster relief funds. These reports were debunked by fact checkers.", "Publication of misleading article": "The junk news website Your News Wire published an article with a headline suggesting that Mayor Yul\u00edn Cruz was facing fraud charges over $3 million in federal disaster relief. The article featured a photograph of Yul\u00edn Cruz wearing a t-shirt with the word \"Nasty,\" which was a reference to President Trump's criticism of Hillary Clinton. Fact checkers later pointed out that a different Puerto Rican mayor, Miguel G. Ortiz-V\u00e9lez, was the one indicted, not Yul\u00edn Cruz.", "Spread of misinformation": "Despite the initial debunking of the false story, various versions of it continued to spread online in the following weeks. Many websites used vague wording, assuming readers would automatically associate the \"Puerto Rico mayor\" mentioned with Yul\u00edn Cruz, who had clashed with President Trump over the handling of Hurricane Maria.", "Misleading YouTube video": "On the one-year anniversary of Hurricane Maria, a YouTube video was posted by The Next News Network, which aimed to appear as a legitimate newscast. The video falsely claimed that Yul\u00edn Cruz had been arrested for corruption involving disaster relief funds. It displayed an image of Yul\u00edn Cruz alongside federal agents, giving the impression that she was being targeted. However, the video eventually clarified that it was Ortiz-V\u00e9lez, not Yul\u00edn Cruz, who was the indicted mayor."}
