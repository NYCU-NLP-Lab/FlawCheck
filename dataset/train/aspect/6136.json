{"Research findings": "The expert mentions that a group of researchers reported in October 2014 that the Triatomine bug, a reduviid bug living in the United States, can carry a parasite that causes Chagas disease. This research finding provides evidence for the claim.", "Testimonies and personal experiences": "The expert includes statements from individuals who have encountered the bug or have heard about it. These testimonies mention the bug's ability to infect individuals with a parasite that carries Chagas disease. While personal experiences may not be scientific evidence, they contribute to the overall authenticity of the claim.", "Studies and data": "The expert references studies conducted by Melissa Nolan Garcia and her team at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. These studies involved collecting triatomine bugs in Texas and examining blood donors with symptoms consistent with Chagas disease. The studies found a high percentage of bugs carrying the parasite and evidence of locally acquired human transmission of the disease. This scientific data supports the claim.", "Official organizations and estimates": "The expert mentions the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and their belief that nearly 300,000 people may be infected with the parasite in the United States. The expert also highlights Melissa Nolan Garcia's belief that this number may be higher due to asymptomatic and undiagnosed cases. The inclusion of official organizations and their estimates adds credibility to the claim."}
