{"Lack of evidence from Cicero": "s actual writings: The expert found no evidence that Cicero actually said or wrote the quote in question. They searched online archives and compiled works of Cicero's writings and addresses but could not locate the passage.", "Attribution to a fictional novel": "The quote was traced back to a 1965 fictional novel by Taylor Caldwell called \"A Pillar of Iron.\" While the novel includes recorded speeches and letters of Cicero, it is a work of fiction, and the passage could not be found in any official documentation of Cicero's extensive writings or speeches.", "Expert opinion": "Catherine Steel, a professor of classics at the University of Glasgow, stated that she has not come across this quote in any of Cicero's work. She mentioned that the idea of an internal threat does surface in his speeches against Catiline from 63 B.C., but there are no close parallels in terms of language.", "False rating": "Based on the lack of evidence and expert opinion, the claim was rated as false by the expert. This indicates that the claim of the quote being a \"two thousand Year Old warning about TRUMP\" is not authentic or accurate."}
