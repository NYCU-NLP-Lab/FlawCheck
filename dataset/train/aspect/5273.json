{"The claim is based on a press release from the Donnelly campaign": "which stated that \"43 of Joe\u2019s legislative proposals have become law, including 21 since President Trump took office.\" This can be considered as one aspect used to verify the authenticity of the claim.", "The Center for Effective Lawmaking": "a nonpartisan research project, named Joe Donnelly the least effective Democrat lawmaker in the United States Senate, stating that he has never sponsored a bill that became a law during his first term. This contradicts the claim and provides another aspect for verification.", "A closer search of the Library of Congress database revealed that Donnelly was among the co": "sponsors of 28 bills that became law. This includes bills where he was an original co-sponsor and bills where his language or amendments were incorporated, totaling 43 legislative proposals. This finding supports the claim and serves as another aspect for verification.", "Senator Ron Johnson": "the sponsor of the Right to Try bill, credited Joe Donnelly as a primary co-sponsor and stated that the bill would not have happened without him. While Donnelly didn't receive official credit on Congress.gov, Johnson's statement reinforces the authenticity of the claim and can be considered as a fourth aspect for verification."}
