{"The comparison of real disposable personal income from 2009 to 2015": "which showed an increase of 11.9 percent. This verifies the claim that after-tax incomes are up nearly 14 percent, although slightly lower.", "The alternative measure of real disposable personal income per capita": "which showed an increase of 6.8 percent from 2009 to 2015. This contradicts the claim and suggests that the growth in after-tax incomes is not as significant when adjusted for population size.", "The calculation made by economist Gary Burtless": "which involved comparing monthly figures from 2009 to 2016. This calculation resulted in a 13.7 percent increase, supporting the claim made by Secretary Pritzker.", "The acknowledgement that different measures of income growth can yield different results": "and that population growth can impact overall personal income numbers. This aspect highlights the complexity of analyzing income growth and suggests that multiple factors need to be considered when assessing the authenticity of the claim."}
