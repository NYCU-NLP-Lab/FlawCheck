{"The expert referred to the data from Aquastat": "a project of the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization, which provides information on the amount of water available for human use. According to Aquastat's 2016 summary, Asia had about 2,000 gallons per day available for each person, which is lower than other continents.", "The expert used data from a 2008 report by the United Nations Environment Program": "which estimated the freshwater resources on each continent. By dividing the totals by population estimates, it was determined that Asia has the lowest volume of freshwater resources per person among continents with year-round residents.", "The expert highlighted the fact that Antarctica": "despite having a large volume of freshwater locked up in its glaciers and ice, has no people except for a small number of researchers. Therefore, in terms of freshwater per capita, Antarctica technically has more than any other continent.", "The expert acknowledged the limitations of the available data": "mentioning that Aquastat does not have summary data for Europe or Africa, and the UN Environment Program's report also has gaps in its estimates for certain regions. Despite these limitations, the evidence still supports the claim that Asia has less freshwater per capita than any other continent, except Antarctica."}
