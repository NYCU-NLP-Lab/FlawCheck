{"The article by Russia": "s pro-Kremlin RT website has been widely shared since its publication in 2014 and has resurfaced on Facebook in recent weeks. It has garnered over 4,000 shares since January 28, 2020, in various countries including Australia, Canada, India, Nigeria, the UK, and elsewhere.", "The article claims that Sharia principles are to be enshrined in the UK legal system for the first time": "It suggests that solicitors will be able to write Islamic wills that can exclude non-believers completely and deny women an equal share of inheritance. It also mentions that standard clauses in a will can be amended to exclude adopted or illegitimate children. The article further states that male heirs generally receive double the amount inherited by female heirs of the same class, and non-Muslims may not inherit at all.", "The article cites a practice note published by the Law Society in March 2014": "The Law Society is an organization representing solicitors in England and Wales. While solicitors are not obligated to follow the advice provided in practice notes, they are issued to advise solicitors on the application of the law. The Law Society has since removed its advice on Sharia succession rules from its website, but an archived version can be found.", "The expert": "s verdict clarifies that the article's claim is misleading. The advice given by the Law Society to lawyers on writing wills for Muslim clients did not result in any change in the law. The headline and first paragraph of the article created the impression that Sharia would be officially incorporated into UK legislation, which is not the case. The then-justice secretary, Chris Grayling, clarified that Sharia law has no jurisdiction in England and Wales. Media reports on the Law Society's advice were also covered by The Telegraph and The Independent, prompting further clarification."}
