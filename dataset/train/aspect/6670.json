{"Confirmation from the state party spokesman": "The expert contacted Greg Leo, the spokesman for the GOP state party headquarters, who confirmed that the raffle of an AR-15 assault rifle did take place at the Oregon State Fair as claimed.", "Fundraiser for the Marion County Republican Central Committee": "The expert learned that the raffle was organized as a fundraiser to benefit the Marion County Republican Central Committee. This information adds credibility to the claim as it provides a motive for the raffle.", "Verification of the rifle type": "The expert investigated whether the AR-15 rifle can be classified as an \"assault rifle.\" While technically it is not classified as an assault rifle because it lacks fully automatic capabilities, the expert found that the term \"AR-15 assault rifle\" is commonly used to describe the firearm in various sources, including firearms sites and news media.", "Existence of similar gun raffles": "The expert discovered that gun raffles, including those involving AR-15 rifles, are not uncommon. The Oregon Firearms Federation, for example, was in the midst of raffling off five AR-15 rifles at the time. This information suggests that the raffle at the Oregon State Fair is consistent with similar events happening elsewhere."}
