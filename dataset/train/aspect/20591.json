{"Graham": "s statement that \"attempted rape is not a crime\" and that Kavanaugh \"respected\" his victim by \"not finishing\" was not a direct quote from him. The expert's verdict clarified that Graham did not literally say those words.", "The expert": "s analysis pointed out that Graham's statement about Kavanaugh and Ford being \"two teenagers\" and that Kavanaugh \"respected\" Ford's objections was misleading. The expert clarified that Ford escaped the alleged assault because Judge intervened, not because Kavanaugh voluntarily stopped. This aspect verifies the distortion in Graham's statement."}
