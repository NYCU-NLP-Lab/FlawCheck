{"The claim was debunked by NASA and a planetary geologist": "Sarah Noble, who confirmed that Mars will not appear as big as the Moon on July 27.", "False accounts of this claim have been circulating since at least 2003": "when Mars was as close to Earth as it had been in 60,000 years.", "The distance between Earth and Mars is significantly greater than the distance between Earth and the Moon": "making it physically impossible for Mars to appear as big as the Moon.", "While Mars opposition will occur on July 27": "it will not be as close to Earth as it was in 2003, and its apparent size will not be as large as the Full Moon."}
