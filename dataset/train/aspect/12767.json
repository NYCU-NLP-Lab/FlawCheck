{"Lack of evidence": "The expert points out that there is no record or credible source indicating that Greta Thunberg made the statement about China banning chopsticks. They mention that they searched articles, interviews, and speeches delivered by Thunberg during that time period and found no mention of this claim.", "Inconsistent sharing": "The expert notes that the rumor was being shared almost exclusively by people expressing a negative view of Thunberg. They suggest that if the quote was genuine, it would have been expected that Thunberg's supporters would also share it initially.", "Ludicrous nature of the claim": "The expert highlights that the claim is described as a juvenile response from the Chinese government, telling someone not to \"wipe their butt\" because toilet paper is made from trees. They emphasize that it would be highly unlikely for such a response to come from the government of the most populous country in the world.", "Lack of credible sources": "The expert mentions that they were unable to find a credible source for both Thunberg's alleged comment and China's alleged insult. They note that the text on the meme circulating online is a near-verbatim copy of text published on a humor website, further questioning the authenticity of the claim."}
