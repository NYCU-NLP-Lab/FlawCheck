{"The hacking conference in Las Vegas": "The expert mentions a hacking conference held every year in Las Vegas where hacking attempts on replicas of election websites were made by children aged 8 to 16. This indicates that such conferences exist and provide opportunities for young individuals to test vulnerabilities.", "Hacking into a replica website": "The expert clarifies that the hacking was not done on the actual election system but on a website designed to resemble Florida's Secretary of State website that reports preliminary election results. This distinction is important as it shows that the hacking did not directly affect the voting system itself.", "Lack of proprietary security features": "The hacked website was not an exact replica of the Secretary of State website as it did not contain the proprietary security features that the official website possesses. This suggests that the hacked website was not as secure as the actual system used for counting votes.", "Election": "night reporting websites: The expert explains that the hacked websites are only used to publish preliminary, unofficial results for the public and the media. These websites are not connected to the vote counting equipment and cannot change actual election results. This emphasizes the limited impact of hacking on the overall election process."}
