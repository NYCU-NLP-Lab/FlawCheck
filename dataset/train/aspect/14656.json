{"Long": "term trend: The expert analyzes the long-term trend of violent crime and murder rates in cities across America. They note that there has been a decline in both the murder rates per population and the total number of murders in cities like New York, Los Angeles, and Dallas, as well as nationwide.", "Historical data": "The expert provides historical data from the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting Statistics to support their claim. They highlight the decrease in the number of murders in Dallas over the years, from 500 in 1991 to 154 in 2012, representing a 70% decrease. They also mention the corresponding decrease in the murder rate per 100,000 in population during the same time frame.", "Recent increase": "The expert acknowledges that there has been a recent year-over-year increase in murders in some cities, including Dallas. They reference a New York Times story that reported a 17% increase in murders in Dallas for January through August 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. However, they caution against drawing conclusions from a few years of data.", "Contextualization": "The expert contextualizes the recent increase in murders by noting that 2014 had been a \"historic low\" in terms of the number of murders in Dallas. They also mention that the murder rate for 2015, according to city officials, was still one of the city's lowest since 1930. This provides a broader perspective on the claim and helps interpret the significance of the recent increase."}
