{"Lack of concrete proof": "Despite the efforts of several Kafka experts and researchers, no concrete evidence such as copies of the \"doll\" letters themselves has been found to verify the claim.", "Historical origins": "The story has a long history dating back more than half a century and was first recounted by Dora Diamant, who was a close partner of Kafka during the final year of his life. This adds credibility to the claim.", "Plausibility": "Some experts have stated that the core claims of the story are plausible, considering Kafka's character and the themes present in his works. This suggests that the claim could potentially be true.", "Popularity and sources": "The claim has gained popularity on social media in recent years and has been mentioned in various publications, including a column by May Benatar in HuffPost and its inclusion in Paul Auster's novel \"The Brooklyn Follies.\" The presence of multiple sources discussing the claim adds to its visibility and potential authenticity."}
