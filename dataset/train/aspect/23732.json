{"The comparison of health status": "The expert's verdict highlights the key aspect of the claim, which is the comparison of the health status of former Philippine President Arroyo during the terms of her successors, Benigno Aquino III and Rodrigo Duterte. The claim presents two contrasting images of Arroyo, one showing her in a wheelchair and wearing a neck brace during Aquino's term, and the other showing her surfing and appearing healthy during Duterte's term.", "Social media sharing and engagement": "The expert's verdict mentions that the collage has been shared more than 200 times on Facebook since its posting on September 10, 2020. This indicates that the claim has gained some traction and attention on social media, potentially influencing public perception.", "Misleading context and image verification": "The expert's verdict highlights the misleading context in which the claim is presented. It mentions that the bottom photo in the collage, which portrays Arroyo surfing, is actually from 2005 during Arroyo's own term as president, not during Duterte's term. The expert used reverse image and keyword searches on Google to verify the authenticity of the photo, tracing it back to a handout photo released by the office of the president in 2005. This aspect emphasizes the importance of fact-checking and image verification to determine the accuracy of claims.", "Additional sources and evidence": "The expert's verdict provides additional sources and evidence to support their analysis. They mention an identical collage shared on Facebook and 9GAG, as well as the availability of the photo with the correct caption in a 2005 report by the Chinese newspaper China Daily. These additional sources help to strengthen the expert's argument and provide further evidence against the authenticity of the claim."}
