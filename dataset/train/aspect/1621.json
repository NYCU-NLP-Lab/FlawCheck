{"The term": "Ranger\" is not exclusively reserved for members of the 75th Ranger Regiment. There are two groups of people who can fairly describe themselves as Army Rangers: soldiers who served in the 75th Ranger Regiment, and soldiers who have completed the U.S. Army Ranger School.", "Sen": "Tom Cotton completed the U.S. Army Ranger School, which qualifies him as a Ranger. However, the context in which he uses the term to describe himself is important. Cotton's statement that his service abroad was \"as an Army Ranger\" falsely implies service in the Special Operating Force, 75th Ranger Regiment.", "Serving as a Ranger qualified officer in a non": "Ranger regiment is not the same as \"serving as a Ranger\" in a conflict. The distinction lies in the context of how the reference is made, distinguishing whether it is for completion of the Ranger School or for being a member of the 75th Ranger Regiment.", "Ranger qualified officers who served in other units do not describe their service": "as a Ranger.\" The statement that someone \"served 'as a U.S. Army Ranger in Iraq and Afghanistan'\" would only be used to refer to service in the Special Operating Force, 75th Ranger Regiment."}
