It states that the India Gate memorial is dedicated to 70,000 troops of British India who died between 1914 and 1921, with 13,300 Commonwealth servicemen commemorated by name on the memorial. This information contradicts the claim's assertion of 61,000 Muslim servicemen's names being inscribed on India Gate.", "Previous fact": "checking: The expert's verdict mentions that the claim was previously fact-checked by the Times of India newspaper.
