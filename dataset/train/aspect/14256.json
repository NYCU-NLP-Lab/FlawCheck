{"The claim is based on data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation": "FBI), which reported that 57,180 officers were victims of line-of-duty assaults in 2016.", "The rate of assaults per minute was calculated by dividing the total number of minutes in a year": "525,600) by the number of reported assaults, resulting in an average of one assault every 9.19 minutes. Adjusting for the 10 percent of agencies that didn't report any data, the rate becomes one assault every 10.3 minutes.", "It is important to note that not all reported assaults resulted in physical harm to the officers": "Some actions that legally count as an assault, such as a drunk person shoving an officer, may not have caused any pain or injury.", "Ambush attacks": "which Trump highlighted in his speech, are actually rare. Out of the 57,180 officer assaults, only 270 were classified as ambush attacks. Most assaults occurred when officers were intervening in disturbances, effectuating arrests, or transporting prisoners."}
