{"The expert cited a 50": "state analysis of state and local taxes published by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, which measured the total state and local taxes as a share of family income for non-elderly taxpayers. This analysis provided evidence that the top 1 percent in Wisconsin pay a smaller share of their income in taxes compared to other income groups.", "The expert mentioned that the report from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy is the only recent study of its kind on state and local taxes in Wisconsin": "This indicates that there is a lack of comparable research, making this report a significant source of information for assessing the claim.", "The expert highlighted the criticism from the Tax Foundation": "a free market-oriented organization, regarding the assumptions made in the Institute's study. The Tax Foundation argued that the study omits certain taxes and includes a federal provision that may skew the results. However, the expert noted that even without considering the omitted taxes and the federal deduction, the richest 1 percent in Wisconsin still have a lower state and local tax burden than other income groups.", "Richard Auxier": "a state and local tax policy expert at the Tax Policy Center, pointed out that state and local taxes in Wisconsin, like in most states, are regressive. This means that they rely heavily on sales and property taxes, which tend to burden lower-income individuals disproportionately. This context supports the claim that the wealthiest 1 percent in Wisconsin may indeed pay a lower overall tax rate compared to other income groups."}
