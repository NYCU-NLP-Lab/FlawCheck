{"Lack of records": "The expert's verdict mentions that there are no records of Obama starting a \"security company\" in the city and states cited by the claim. This lack of official records casts doubt on the authenticity of the claim.", "Dubious sources": "The claim originated from websites with questionable credibility, such as americanewsupdates.me and newsfeedusa.us. These sources, flagged as potentially false by Facebook users, further undermine the credibility of the claim.", "Inability to find the company": "The expert's investigation involved searching business records in Washington, D.C., New York, California, and Illinois, but no record of the mentioned company, \"NOS United,\" was found. This inability to locate any information about the company raises doubts about its existence.", "Lack of evidence and wild claims": "The claim makes wild assertions, such as a \"population reduction plan\" and targeting Trump supporters for mass graves, but fails to provide any credible sources or evidence to support these claims. This lack of substantiation weakens the credibility of the overall claim."}
