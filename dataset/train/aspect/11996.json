{"The expert analyzed budget data from the U": "S. Department of Agriculture, which runs the food stamp program, to determine the actual amount spent on administration. It was found that only $136.5 million, or one tenth of 1 percent, of the total budget was spent on administration, far from the claimed 70 percent.", "The expert also referred to a briefing paper from the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities": "which calculated administrative costs at about 5 percent by including additional categories of spending such as state administrative costs and educational programs for SNAP participants.", "The expert explored the possibility that the claim may have included retirement costs of SNAP employees": "which could slightly increase the administrative costs. However, even with this inclusion, the most generous accounting of SNAP's administrative costs fell well short of the claimed 70 percent.", "The expert mentioned that the source of the claim was likely a book titled": "The Poverty of Welfare: Helping Others in Civil Society\" by Michael Tanner, a libertarian author. However, Bachmann's office did not provide further clarification on the specific reference within the book that supported the claim."}
