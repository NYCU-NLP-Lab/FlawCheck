{"Lack of conclusive evidence": "The expert's verdict highlights that there is no conclusive evidence to support Carson's claim that \"a lot of people\" change from heterosexual to homosexual while in prison. This lack of evidence undermines the authenticity of the claim.", "Medical community consensus": "The expert mentions that the medical community tends to conclude that homosexuality is not a matter of choice. This consensus among professionals contradicts Carson's assertion that homosexuality is a choice.", "Study sample size": "The expert refers to a study conducted by Christopher Hensley, which questioned 142 prisoners about their sexual orientation. However, the expert points out that this sample size is too small to draw sweeping conclusions, as it represents only about 0.001 percent of the nation's prison population.", "Difference between prison and outside sex culture": "The expert explains that prison sex culture is not analogous to the sex culture outside of prison. This challenges Carson's implication that prison behavior can be used to support the idea that a shift in sexual orientation is a choice."}
