{"Calculation of transit project costs": "The expert's verdict mentions that the opponents of the tax plan tallied the combined cost of all the transit projects that the tax would fund, which amounted to $3.16 billion.", "Estimation of cars taken off the road": "The opponents of the tax plan calculated the number of cars that the transit expansions would take off the road. They used the Atlanta Regional Commission's projection of an increase of 74,800 boardings per day and divided it by two, considering that commuters need to board a bus or train twice a day. This resulted in an estimate of 37,400 cars off the road.", "Determination of per": "car cost: To determine the cost of taking one car off the road, the opponents divided the total cost of transit projects ($3.16 billion) by the estimated number of cars off the road (37,400). This calculation resulted in a per-car cost of approximately $84,500.", "Alternative cost calculation": "The opponents also provided an alternative calculation, including certain maintenance costs, which they claimed demonstrated that the true cost of taking one car off the road was $105,000. They argued that this higher cost should be considered instead of the $90,000 mentioned in the claim."}
