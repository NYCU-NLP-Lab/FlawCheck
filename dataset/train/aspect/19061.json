{"The ad features video clips of President Donald Trump calling Dan McCready an": "ultra liberal\" who \"really admires socialism.\" This footage was taken from a rally in North Carolina where Trump endorsed Dan Bishop and attacked McCready. The use of Trump's words in the ad suggests that McCready supports socialism.", "The ad shows images of Dan McCready alongside prominent left": "wing politicians such as Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, Senator Bernie Sanders, and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. The voiceover claims that McCready is backed by radicals who support open borders and socialized medicine, further implying his socialist leanings.", "The fact": "checkers searched for evidence on McCready's website and statements but found no support for the claim that he is a socialist. They also reached out to Bishop's campaign for evidence but received no response. The lack of concrete evidence backing the claim raises doubts about its authenticity.", "The National Republican Congressional Committee linked McCready to": "radical ideas\" such as infanticide, the Green New Deal, and government-run socialized healthcare. However, these associations are often used as political tactics by Republicans to discredit their opponents and may not necessarily reflect McCready's actual beliefs or policy positions."}
