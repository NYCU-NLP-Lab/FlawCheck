{"The expert": "s verdict highlights that PolitiFact Texas gave a Mostly False rating to the claim that Congress is on a \"five-week vacation.\" This rating was based on the fact that even during recess, lawmakers continue to attend to their districts by holding town halls and other meetings.", "The expert mentions that President Barack Obama used the same terminology to describe the congressional recess": "referring to Congress being on vacation. This similarity in language usage between Obama and Gov. Rick Perry's claims is considered significant.", "The expert notes that the White House also used the word": "vacation\" in the introduction to the transcript it sent to reporters, stating that \"Congress is about to go on vacation.\" This further reinforces the usage of the term by different sources.", "The expert refers to the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1970": "which mandates an annual recess for Congress. According to this law, the House and Senate are required to adjourn for the month of August, until after Labor Day, unless Congress provides otherwise. This legal requirement supports the notion that Congress takes a recess during this period, even if they are not technically on a \"vacation\" in the traditional sense."}
