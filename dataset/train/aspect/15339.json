The commenter mentioned that the vehicles were created for use at the Burning Man festival, indicating that their purpose is unrelated to the Zika virus or any mutations.", "Purpose description": "The expert found information from Pathogen Trackers, which described the purpose of the vehicles during the Burning Man festival.
