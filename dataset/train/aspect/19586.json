{"The claim suggests that the Halloween celebrated on October 31": "2015, is the 666th in history. The expert's verdict states that there is no basis for this notion as Halloween does not have a definitive beginning and evolved over a long period of time influenced by various cultures.", "The expert": "s verdict mentions the letter Pope Gregory I sent to Bishop Mellitus in the 6th century, suggesting the adoption and consecration of existing non-Christian places of worship to serve a Christian purpose. This supports the idea that Halloween was a deliberate effort to absorb and adapt existing Pagan practices into Christianity, further undermining the claim of a specific numbered Halloween.", "The origin of the term": "Halloween\" itself is discussed in the expert's verdict. It states that the word originated in the mid-18th century as a Scottish shortening of \"Allhallow-even,\" which refers to the eve of All Saints' Day on October 31. This linguistic evidence suggests that Halloween, as we know it today, is a relatively recent development and not a long-standing tradition with a specific numerical count."}
