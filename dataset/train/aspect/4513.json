{"The video shows a man carrying a horse": "but it does not accurately depict a heroic effort to save an animal in danger. Instead, it showcases Ukrainian strongman Dmytro Vasilievich Khaladzhi demonstrating his strength by carrying a horse.", "The claim that the horse was bitten by a venomous snake and the man carried it for three miles is not supported by any evidence": "The backstory about a medical emergency involving a snakebite was invented to increase the video's chances of going viral.", "The actual distance that Khaladzhi carried the horse is unclear and not specified in the available information": "4. While Khaladzhi holds numerous titles in the Ukrainian Book of Records, there is no evidence to support the claim that he holds any Guinness World Records. The assertion that he holds 63 Guinness World Records appears to be a faulty factoid resulting from poor translations or incomplete information."}
