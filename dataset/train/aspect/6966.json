The article falsely accuses President Obama of secretly ordering White House staff to observe silence during Muslim prayers and providing prayer rugs for Muslims.", "The article includes a photo of Muslim men praying at the White House": "suggesting it was part of the alleged \"secret\" ritual, but the photo was taken during a special event in July 2016 and not related to the claim.", "The website that published the claim has a history of spreading false information and making other debunked claims": "such as comedian Rosie O'Donnell being detained by the Secret Service and Obama \"banning\" Baby Jesus from the White House."}
