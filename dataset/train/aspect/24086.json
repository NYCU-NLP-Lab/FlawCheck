{"Comparison to historical data": "The expert analyzed historical data from the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the White House's Office of Management and Budget to determine the trend of federal revenues as a share of the gross domestic product (GDP) over the years. They found that federal revenues in recent years have been at their lowest level in roughly 60 years.", "Impact of recession": "The expert explained that one contributing factor to the lower ratio of federal revenues to GDP in recent years is the drop in incomes and tax collections during the recession. This indicates that the claim about the lowest federal revenues in 40-50 years is accurate.", "Effect of tax cuts": "The expert also mentioned that tax cuts, including the lower income tax rates approved by President George W. Bush, have reduced federal revenues. This further supports the claim that government revenue has decreased in recent years.", "Influence of economic cycles": "The expert highlighted the cyclical nature of taxes as a share of GDP, stating that the tax/GDP ratio tends to rise during expansions and fall during recessions. This volatility in corporate profits and changes in income tax rates can explain the fluctuations in federal revenues over time."}
