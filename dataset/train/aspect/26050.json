{"The claim is supported by an image shared by actress Minka Kelly": "which states that an elephant is killed for its ivory tusks by the time you drink your coffee.", "The claim is backed by a statement made by Minka Kelly on social media": "where she mentions that elephants are being killed at an alarming rate, both by ivory poachers and wealthy American trophy hunters. She also provides an estimate that an elephant is killed every 15 minutes for its ivory, resulting in 96 animals per day.", "The authenticity of the claim is verified through a study that used data from carcass": "monitoring field sites maintained by CITES to model the Africa-wide number of illegal elephant deaths. The study calculated the percentage of elephants estimated to be killed by poaching and applied it to current estimates of the total number of African elephant species.", "The fact": "checkers conducted an unscientific Twitter poll to gauge the time taken by respondents to finish their coffee. The results showed that for a third of respondents who took 15 minutes to finish their coffee, the claim corresponded to one elephant poached. However, for those who drank faster or slower, the claim did not hold up or underestimated the number of elephant deaths."}
