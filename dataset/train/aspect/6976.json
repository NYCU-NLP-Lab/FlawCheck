{"Lack of evidence": "The expert's verdict highlights that there is no evidence to support the claim that coronavirus patients are being cremated alive in China. This suggests that the authenticity of the claim is questionable.", "Source credibility": "The expert mentions that the claim originated from a website connected to Steve Bannon and an exiled Chinese billionaire. This raises concerns about the reliability and credibility of the source, which could further cast doubt on the authenticity of the claim.", "Contradictory information": "The expert's verdict includes information from the Chinese government and the World Health Organization, stating that the Chinese government has ordered swift cremation of deceased coronavirus patients, but there is no evidence to suggest they are being cremated alive. This contradiction further undermines the credibility of the claim.", "Inconsistent video footage": "The expert's verdict describes a Facebook video that asserts coronavirus patients in Wuhan are being cremated alive. However, the video includes unrelated footage of the coronavirus outbreak and a newscast from NTD News, which suggests that the video may not provide reliable evidence to support the claim."}
