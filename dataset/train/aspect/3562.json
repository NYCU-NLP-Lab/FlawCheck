{"Testimony from Florida House Speaker Richard Corcoran": "The expert's verdict includes a statement from Corcoran where he specifically mentions the claim and provides details about how the contract was amended from 305 promised jobs to six. This testimony serves as direct evidence supporting the claim.", "Documentation of the proposed deal": "The expert's verdict mentions that the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity provided the Legislature with an outline of the deal between Enterprise Florida and Lockheed Martin. This outline, signed by Governor Rick Scott, states that if Lockheed Martin wins the AMDR contract and chooses to complete the work in Pinellas County, they will create 305 new jobs. This document serves as official evidence supporting the claim.", "Mention of competition between Lockheed Martin facilities": "The expert's verdict mentions that Lockheed Martin officials stated that their other facilities in the Northeast were also competing for the contract. This suggests that Lockheed Martin had multiple options and could potentially reduce the number of jobs in one facility if they chose to allocate resources elsewhere. This aspect indirectly supports the claim.", "Statement about using extra cash for facility renovation": "The expert's verdict states that based on the 2012 document, Lockheed Martin and the DEO wanted to use the extra cash from the deal to renovate the Oldsmar facility and invest more in manufacturing equipment. This aspect implies that Lockheed Martin had reasons to reduce the number of jobs in order to allocate funds for facility improvements, providing a possible motive for amending the contract."}
