{"The claim is attributed to U": "S. Rep. Lamar Smith, a Republican from San Antonio.", "The claim is based on a press release by Smith": "where he references a study conducted by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and a chart published by the Wall Street Journal.", "The CBO study found that the top 20 percent of income earners paid 67": "9 percent of federal taxes, which is close to the claim of nearly 70 percent.", "Roberton Williams": "a senior fellow at the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, confirmed the accuracy of the claim but noted that the $74,000 salary figure mentioned by Smith was specific to single individuals and the CBO adjusts its figures based on household size."}
