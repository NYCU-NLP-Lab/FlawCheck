This data suggests significant economic growth under Clinton's presidency.", "Comparison with other postwar presidents": "The expert mentions a ranking of postwar presidents based on GDP growth during their terms, adjusted to 2005 dollars. According to this ranking, Clinton had the highest GDP growth of $2.7 trillion, followed by George W. Bush with $1.7 trillion, Reagan with $1.6 trillion, and Johnson with $741 billion.
