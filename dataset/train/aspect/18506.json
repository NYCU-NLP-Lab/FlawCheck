{"The expert mentions that the estimated death toll of the Wuhan coronavirus is 81": "all of them in China, as of early Jan. 27. This information is based on data collected and mapped by Johns Hopkins University\u2019s Center for Systems Science and Engineering, which draws data from reliable sources such as the World Health Organization, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and China\u2019s National Health Commission.", "The expert highlights that the claim of": "10,000 dead in Wuhan, China\" is based on an unconfirmed report from a website called jsmineset.com. The website itself has a disclaimer stating that it cannot vouch for the accuracy or completeness of its information. The report is a hearsay email from someone named \"Robert\" who claims to have received information from a Chinese friend with relatives in Wuhan. However, no other evidence is provided to support this claim.", "The expert mentions that social media posts and online stories have been spreading misinformation about the number of deaths related to the new coronavirus": "These posts and stories lack proper sourcing and often make exaggerated claims without any evidence.", "The expert contrasts the misinformation being spread with the official figures reported by health officials and reputable sources": "The confirmed death toll of the virus is 81, and the number of confirmed cases worldwide is 2,886, as of early Jan. 27. These figures stand in stark contrast to the false claim of thousands or 10,000 dead."}
