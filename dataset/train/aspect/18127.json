{"The Supreme Court ruling on the Second Amendment": "The expert mentions that when the Supreme Court ruled in June 2008 that the Second Amendment protects an individual's right to possess a firearm and that the Washington, D.C., gun ban is unconstitutional, both Obama and John McCain issued statements with their reactions. This ruling serves as a basis for examining Obama's stance on banning handguns.", "Obama": "s belief in the individual right to own a gun: The expert includes a statement mentioning that Obama has consistently expressed his belief that the Second Amendment provides an individual right to own a gun. This aspect highlights Obama's stance on gun ownership and contrasts it with the allegations of flip-flopping on banning handguns.", "Evidence provided by the McCain campaign": "The expert mentions that the McCain campaign provides three main pieces of evidence to support their claim of Obama's flip-flopping on banning handguns. These include a 1996 voter questionnaire where Obama answered \"Yes\" to supporting a ban on handguns, a Chicago Tribune article from 2007 where the Obama campaign is quoted as supporting the rights of law-abiding gun owners while also endorsing common sense laws, and Obama's refusal to state a position on the D.C. handgun ban."}
