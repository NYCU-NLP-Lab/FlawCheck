{"The claim is based on the statement made by State Sen": "Tom Tiffany, a candidate for Wisconsin\u2019s open 7th U.S. Congressional District seat, regarding the impact of federal regulation on the wolf population.", "The claim is supported by the assertion that the federal management of the wolf population has led to attacks on livestock": "resulting in decreased production and causing dairy farms to go out of business.", "The claim is further reinforced by the historical evidence of more than 800 dairy farms closing in Wisconsin in 2019": "which is attributed to a downturn in milk prices and other factors, including the presence of wolves.", "The claim is substantiated by the state program in Wisconsin that reimburses farmers for losses from verified wolf killings": "with over $63,000 paid out in 2018 for various damages caused by wolves, such as dead and missing calves, dead cows, and treatments of cattle by a veterinarian."}
