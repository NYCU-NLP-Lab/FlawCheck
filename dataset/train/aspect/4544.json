{"The claim was made in an email blast sent by the Texas Democratic Party": "signed by party chairman Gilberto Hinojosa, seeking signatures on a petition calling for hearings on a legislative measure tightening abortion restrictions in Texas. The claim stated that if the bill passes, someone living in El Paso would have to drive 550 miles each way to San Antonio for cervical cancer screening at a clinic.", "House Bill 2": "which was approved by a House committee and awaiting Senate consideration, would ban most abortions after 20 weeks and impose stricter standards for abortion clinics. Opponents of the bill argued that the requirement for clinics to upgrade to ambulatory surgical center standards could lead to the closure of 36 out of 42 clinics that perform most Texas abortions.", "When contacted about the claim": "the Democratic Party spokesperson clarified that the intention was not to imply that no El Paso facility would provide such services. They acknowledged that there may be other clinics open for screenings in El Paso but emphasized that the claim was meant to highlight the distance and inconvenience that women may face if they have to travel to clinics covered under HB2.", "Two El Paso clinics": "Reproductive Services of El Paso and Hill Top Women\u2019s Reproductive Clinic, were identified as potentially facing closure if the measure becomes law. Reproductive Services of El Paso offers cancer screenings and other services, while Hill Top Women\u2019s Reproductive Clinic solely provides abortions and pregnancy tests. However, it was not confirmed if these clinics would indeed shut down, as there was no response when attempts were made to contact them."}
