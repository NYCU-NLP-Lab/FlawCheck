{"Rep": "Steve Stockman introduced the Safe Schools Act of 2013, which aimed to repeal a federal law banning everyone except law enforcement from bringing a weapon inside a school. This action indicates Stockman's support for allowing more people to have firearms in schools.", "David Kopel": "an associate policy analyst with the Cato Institute, stated that Stockman's bill aimed to give principals, teachers, and staff the ability to defend themselves and their students. This suggests that the bill's intention was to increase the number of individuals with firearms in schools.", "Erich Pratt": "director of communications for Gun Owners of America, mentioned the example of Pearl, Miss., where an assistant principal successfully apprehended a student shooter by using a gun he kept in his car. This highlights the belief that having more guns in schools can enhance security and prevent potential harm.", "Pratt also referred to a Centers for Disease Control study that found a higher number of defensive gun uses compared to the number of times a gun was used to kill someone": "This implies that proponents of Stockman's bill believe that more guns can be used for defensive purposes and contribute to overall safety."}
