{"Grammatical error in the ad": "The expert's verdict mentions that the ad claiming to show a young and shirtless Donald Trump had a grammatical error in the text, stating \"Photos of Young Donald Trump You Never Seen Before.\" This error raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Lack of credible sources": "The expert's investigation reveals that the picture of the shirtless man purported to be Donald Trump had only appeared on a very small number of websites and had never been featured on any credible news source. This lack of credible sources casts doubt on the authenticity of the claim.", "No resemblance between the individuals": "The expert points out that a picture of Trump graduating from Wharton School in 1968 showed no resemblance to the shirtless man in question. This lack of resemblance further undermines the claim's authenticity.", "Absence of the picture in the genuine story": "The expert confirms that the lengthy slideshow story on Bon Voyaged, which featured genuine photographs of Trump and his family, did not include the picture of the shirtless man with his arms outstretched. This absence suggests that the claim and the picture were unrelated and likely clickbait."}
