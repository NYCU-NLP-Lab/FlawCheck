{"The expert considered the data from a 2010 report by the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia": "which showed the decrease in general funds spent per in-state, full-time student at a four-year college from $8,709 in budget years 2006 and 2007 to $6,500 in 2010 and 2011, representing a 25.4 percent drop.", "The expert also examined the average state funding per student at community colleges": "which decreased from $4,602 in fiscal 2006 and 2007 to $2,946 in 2010 and 2011, indicating a 36 percent decrease.", "The expert considered the relationship between state spending on higher education and tuition costs": "According to a 2009 SCHEV report, when state spending decreases, tuitions typically rise to compensate for the shortfall. This suggests that the reduction in higher education funding could have contributed to the increase in tuition costs during Kaine's term.", "The expert took into account the fact that tuition did": "in fact, increase during Kaine's term. While the specific percentage increase in tuition is not mentioned in the given information, the expert acknowledges that the average costs for in-state tuition and instructional fees at four-year institutions went up, further supporting the claim made by the Republican Party of Virginia."}
