{"The claim is debunked by experts in the field": "such as David Karp, a pomologist at UC Riverside, who states that bell peppers do not have a gender and grow from flowers with both male and female parts.", "The Encyclopedia of Fruit and Nuts confirms that bell peppers have complete and perfect flowers with male and female sex organs": "making them hermaphroditic and not classifiable as one gender or the other.", "The claim has been circulating on the internet for years and has gained recent attention on social media platforms": "but its popularity does not change the fact that it is not true.", "While some food blogs suggest assigning a gender to bell peppers as a memory aid for choosing the right ones for specific purposes": "such as seed collection or cooking, this gender assignment is not scientifically accurate and does not impact the taste or quality of the pepper."}
