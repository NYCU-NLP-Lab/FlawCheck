{"The claim is based on Dan McCready": "s accusation that Dan Bishop \"took the only vote from either party \u2014 the only vote \u2014 against pharmacists being able to tell people about lower-cost drugs.\"", "The expert": "s verdict confirms that Dan Bishop was indeed the only member of the North Carolina General Assembly to vote against The Pharmacy Patient Fair Practices Act, which aimed to ban gag orders discouraging pharmacists from offering customers cheaper alternative drugs.", "Dan Bishop": "s opposition to the bill was explained as being \"for procedural reasons\" and because he didn't have time to read the final version of the House bill before the vote. However, he supported a similar Senate bill.", "While Bishop": "s vote against the bill is true, his votes and statements indicate that he is in favor of allowing pharmacists to inform people about cheaper alternative drugs as long as it doesn't burden pharmacies and customers with higher costs. He supported changes in the Senate version of the bill to protect consumers from additional costs."}
