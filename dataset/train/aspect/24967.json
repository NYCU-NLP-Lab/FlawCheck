{"The expert examined the claim made by Charlotte Bergmann": "a Republican businesswoman, that the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) represents \"the largest tax increase in the history of the world.\"", "The expert requested sourcing from the Bergmann campaign to back up the claim": "and they provided a list of selected taxes included in the health-care law. This list included specific tax increases such as the increase in Medicare payroll taxes for high-income individuals, a new excise tax on high-cost health plans, an annual fee on health insurance providers, and a change in the floor on medical expense deductions.", "The expert verified that the information provided by the Bergmann campaign was accurate and came from a larger summary of tax provisions distributed by the nonpartisan federal Joint Committee on Taxation": "4. The expert acknowledged that while the taxes mentioned by the Bergmann campaign were indeed accurate, the question of whether the Affordable Care Act constitutes the largest tax increase ever is subjective and cannot be definitively determined without comparing it to tax increases in other countries or historical events."}
