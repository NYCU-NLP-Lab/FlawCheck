{"The source of the claim": "The expert verifies that the claim originated from a Facebook page called \"Pictures in History,\" which is known for frequently sharing manipulated or miscaptioned images. This raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Comparison with original image": "The expert found that the image in question, showing Chris Hadfield holding a bag of marijuana, was doctored. The genuine image, originally posted on Hadfield's Twitter account, actually depicted him holding a bag of Easter Eggs. This comparison helps establish that the claim is false.", "NASA": "s drug-free policy: The expert mentions that NASA has been a drug-free workplace since at least the mid-1980s. This policy makes it highly unlikely that any genuine photographs of astronauts with drug paraphernalia, including marijuana, exist. This further discredits the claim.", "Expert opinion and warning": "Astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson is cited as warning against drug use aboard the International Space Station, emphasizing the potential dangers it poses to astronauts. His opinion adds weight to the argument that the claim is not only false but also impractical and potentially harmful."}
