{"The expert highlighted the specific figures mentioned in the claim": "stating that the White House budget actually calls for larger deficits for the next several years and would add $7 trillion to the national debt over 10 years. This contradicts the claim that Trump's budget reduced the deficit by $3 trillion.", "The expert referred to the White House budget document itself": "specifically page 117, which contains the \"Budget Totals\" summary. This summary shows the proposed annual deficits, which are significantly higher than the claim suggests.", "The expert cited news accounts that focused on the growing federal deficit and mounting debt mentioned in the Trump budget": "These accounts from reputable sources like The New York Times, The Los Angeles Times, and The Washington Post further support the expert's verdict that the claim is inaccurate.", "The expert mentioned statements made by White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders and her deputy Raj Shah": "who pushed back against the news coverage by claiming that Trump's budget had reduced the deficit by $3 trillion. However, the expert pointed out that Sanders and Shah were referring to proposed \"major savings and reforms\" in the budget, which would only reduce federal spending if enacted. This indicates that the claim is based on potential savings rather than actual deficit reduction."}
