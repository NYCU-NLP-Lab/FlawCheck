{"The photo used to support the claim was taken in March": "before the first cases of COVID-19 emerged in Michigan, indicating that it is not recent and cannot be used as evidence of double standards on mask-wearing.", "The individuals in the photo": "Joe Biden and Gretchen Whitmer, were attending a campaign rally and a fundraiser at the Detroit Athletic Club, which took place before any COVID-19 restrictions or mask mandates were in place in Michigan.", "The person who posted the photo on Instagram": "Dennis Archer Jr., confirmed in his caption that the photo was taken \"pre-Covid,\" further supporting the fact that it is not recent and cannot be used to accuse the politicians of hypocrisy.", "The Detroit Free Press reported that the fundraiser at the Detroit Athletic Club took place on March 9": "before any COVID-19 cases were identified in Michigan and before the state required people to wear face coverings. This further reinforces the timeline and context of the photo, debunking the claim of double standards on mask-wearing."}
