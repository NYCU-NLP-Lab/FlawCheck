{"The Thai": "language caption in the video translates to English as \"Molave has reached Vietnam. Thailand prepare, are you ready?\" This caption suggests that the video is related to Typhoon Molave making landfall in Vietnam in October 2020.", "Typhoon Molave did hit several parts of southeast Asia in October 2020": "including central Vietnam on October 28. This information is supported by an AFP report, which confirms the occurrence of widespread flooding and damage caused by the typhoon.", "However": "upon further investigation, it was determined that all of the clips in the video actually pre-date Typhoon Molave. Reverse image searches on Google revealed that most of the videos had previously circulated online in reports about Typhoon Mangkhut, which struck parts of China, Hong Kong, and Macau in September 2018. Typhoon Mangkhut was the strongest storm of 2018, causing significant destruction in the mentioned areas.", "Specific evidence supporting the misattribution of the videos includes the publication dates and locations of the clips": "The first clip, titled \"Mangkhut ravages Macau,\" was published on YouTube on September 16, 2018, and features Cantonese being spoken. Another clip, published by the UK's Daily Mail newspaper, also matches the description of the third video in the misleading posts. Additionally, videos identical to the ones in the misleading post were found on Bilibili, a Shanghai-based video sharing website, and were published on September 16, 2018. The fourth video, titled \"Father and son getting swept away by Typhoon Mangkhut in Hong Kong,\" was published by the UK newspaper Metro on the same date. The fifth video, showing a flooded hotel lobby in China, was published in a September 17, 2018 report by UK newspaper The Evening Standard."}
