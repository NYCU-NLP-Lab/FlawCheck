{"The claim states that": "83% of Trump tax breaks go to the wealthiest 1%.\" This claim is based on a December 2017 analysis by the Tax Policy Center, a reputable source for tax-related research.", "The Tax Policy Center": "s analysis considered the impact of the tax law on different income groups over three years: 2018, 2025, and 2027. The claim, however, focuses only on the percentage for 2027, where 82.8% of the tax cuts go to the top 1% of tax filers. This selective use of data is a key aspect in verifying the authenticity of the claim.", "The claim also fails to mention that in 2018": "only 20.5% of the tax cuts went to the top 1%, and in 2025, it was 25.3%. By omitting these numbers, the claim presents a skewed picture of the distribution of tax breaks.", "The expert points out that the lopsided benefits in the tax law come in the final year": "which is not representative of the overall 10-year period covered by the law. The claim's focus on the final year without providing a cumulative analysis over the entire period is another important aspect to consider when evaluating its authenticity."}
