{"The expert": "s verdict includes a direct quote from former Sen. Joe Lieberman stating that President Barack Obama had the legal authority to strike Syria without a vote from Congress. This statement provides a clear affirmation of the claim's authenticity.", "The expert also mentions United States law": "specifically the Constitution and the War Powers Resolution, which outline the powers of the president as commander in chief and the role of Congress in declaring war. This legal framework supports the claim that the president has the authority to take military action without congressional approval.", "The expert highlights that presidents have historically initiated military activities using their constitutionally granted powers as commander in chief": "without an official declaration of war. This historical precedent further strengthens the claim that President Obama had the legal authority to strike Syria without a vote from Congress.", "The expert mentions that although President Obama announced his intention to seek a congressional resolution": "he affirmed that he had the authority to carry out the military action without specific congressional authorization. This statement from the president himself serves as another aspect verifying the claim's authenticity."}
