{"Lack of credible source": "The expert found no credible source or evidence to support the claim that George Soros made the statement attributed to him. They searched for references on a German publication's website, online news archives, and even reached out to the philanthropic organization founded by Soros, all of which yielded no corroboration.", "Inconsistent language and context": "The quote attributed to Soros in the claim uses language and context that is inconsistent with his usual public statements and actions. Soros is a heavily scrutinized figure, and if he had made such a statement in 2014, it would have garnered significant attention in the media.", "Flagged as false news": "The claim was flagged as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misinformation. This indicates that the content did not meet the platform's standards of authenticity and reliability.", "Confirmation from Open Society Foundations": "The expert reached out to Open Society Foundations, the philanthropic organization founded by Soros, and they confirmed that there is no truth to the post. This adds further credibility to the conclusion that the claim is false."}
