{"The claim is made by Colbert Busch": "a candidate running for a special election in South Carolina's 1st Congressional District. This provides context and establishes the source of the claim.", "The claim is made on Equal Pay Day": "a symbolic day that represents the number of months a woman must work to earn the same as a man in one year. This highlights the timing and significance of the claim.", "The claim is supported by a report from the National Partnership for Women and Families": "which examined the pay gap in South Carolina based on census data of full-time, year-round workers. This adds credibility to the claim by referencing a reputable organization and their research.", "The claim is corroborated by Drucilla Barker": "a professor of women's and gender studies at the University of South Carolina, who states that the gender wage gap persists even after controlling for factors like education level and time on the job. This expert opinion reinforces the validity of the claim."}
