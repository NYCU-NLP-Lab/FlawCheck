{"The expert considered the source of the claim": "which was a Democratic National Committee (DNC) web ad that mocked Republican leaders and included the statement \"21 percent party ID and shrinking.\" The ad was inspired by an op-ed written by Republican Senator Olympia Snowe, expressing her concerns about the Republican Party's treatment of moderates.", "The expert analyzed polling data from reputable organizations such as Gallup Polls and Pew Research Center for People and the Press to verify the claim": "These polls indicated varying percentages of party identification as Republicans, with Gallup finding 28 percent and Pew counting it at 23 percent.", "The expert also consulted Pollster": "com, a website that aggregates multiple polls to provide more accurate results. Pollster.com listed several polls with party identification numbers above the 21 percent cited by the Democrats. Using the range of numbers, Pollster.com calculated an overall estimate of 26.4 percent.", "The expert considered the context and potential bias of the claim": "They noted that the Democrats may have cherry-picked the lowest percentage to support their argument, suggesting that the claim may not accurately represent the true state of Republican party identification."}
