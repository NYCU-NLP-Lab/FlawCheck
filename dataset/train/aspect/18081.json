{"The statistics provided by the Ministry of Justice": "which state that almost 1 in 5 trials are \"ineffective\" and almost 2 in 5 trials are \"cracked\", verify the claim that more than half of criminal trials in England and Wales have to be rescheduled or called off.", "The comparison of the proportion of ineffective trials in the Magistrates": "Court in 2003 (29%) and last year (18%), as well as the rise in the proportion of effective trials from a third to 45%, supports the authenticity of the claim.", "The increase in the proportion of ineffective trials due to administrative problems from 3": "7% in 2007 to almost 5% in 2014 provides additional evidence for the claim.", "The agreement between Michael Gove and criminal lawyers protesting against the Ministry of Justice about the pressure on the courts further validates the claim": ""}
