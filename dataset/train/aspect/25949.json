The estimated attendance at the rally was around 20,000 people inside the Toyota Center, with an additional 3,000 people outside the arena.", "The actual crowd size at the Cleveland Cavaliers": "championship parade in 2016, which the photograph captures, was estimated to be around 1.3 million people.
