{"Lack of evidence of marital connection": "The expert's verdict clearly states that there is no truth to the claim that the jilted wife of the owner of Home Depot created the Lowe's chain of home improvement stores. This is supported by the fact that Lowe's was actually started by two brothers-in-law, James Lowe and Carl Buchan, in 1946, and there is no evidence of any marital connection between them and the owner of Home Depot.", "Historical timeline": "The expert's verdict provides a detailed historical timeline of the founding and development of both Lowe's and Home Depot. This timeline clearly shows that Lowe's was established in 1946, while Home Depot was founded in 1978. There is no overlap or connection between the two companies' origins, further debunking the claim.", "Official records and leadership": "The expert's verdict mentions that Lowe's went public in 1961 and started trading on the New York Stock Exchange in 1979. It also provides information about the current President and CEO of Lowe's, Marvin R. Ellison, and the previous Chairman, President, and CEO, Robert A. Niblock. These official records and leadership details support the authenticity of Lowe's as an independent company with no connection to Home Depot through a jilted wife.", "Lack of credible sources and multiple versions of the rumor": "The expert's verdict highlights that the claim circulating about the jilted wife and the rivalry between Lowe's and Home Depot is nothing more than a rumor. It mentions that the rumor has been heard from a number of folks and presents different versions of the story. However, it emphasizes that there is no shred of truth in any of these versions. The lack of credible sources and the presence of contradictory accounts further undermine the authenticity of the claim."}
