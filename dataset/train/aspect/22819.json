{"President Obama": "s trade agenda is facing opposition from fellow Democrats, particularly Senator Elizabeth Warren, who argues that if the proposed fast-track legislation is passed, it could potentially undermine Dodd-Frank financial regulations.", "The trade debate involves two separate aspects": "the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which is the trade deal being negotiated by Obama with several Pacific countries, and the Trade Promotion Authority (TPA), which is the legislation that would enable trade agreements to move through Congress under special rules known as \"fast-track.\"", "If fast": "track rules are implemented, Congress would be restricted from amending or filibustering a trade agreement, and it would only require 51 votes in the Senate for the agreement to pass. This has led to concerns about diminishing Congress' role in the process.", "Critics": "such as Senator Warren, argue that fast-track legislation could potentially allow a future president to use a trade agreement to override domestic financial rules, such as Dodd-Frank, by including provisions that require scaling back these regulations to comply with the agreement."}
