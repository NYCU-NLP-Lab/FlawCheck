{"Comparison of policies": "The expert analyzed the claim and compared the immigration policies of President Obama and President Trump. They found that while both presidents wanted to take action against undocumented immigrants, there was no evidence in the video to suggest that Obama agreed with Trump's specific policy of separating families at the border.", "Contextual analysis": "The expert examined the context of the video and highlighted that the quotes used in the clip were out of order and out of context. They provided the full speech by Obama, showing that the video selectively used certain passages to create the false impression of agreement.", "Speech analysis": "The expert analyzed Obama's speech on immigration and pointed out that the video compiled several moments from a speech he delivered in 2014. They highlighted that although Obama did say the words used in the clip, the quotes were not related to the specific policy of family separation.", "Discrediting disinformation": "The expert explicitly stated that the video was disingenuous and provided a counter-narrative to debunk the claim. They emphasized that Obama's full speech contained passages that directly contradicted the claim, demonstrating that the video was misleading and not an accurate representation of Obama's stance on the policy."}
