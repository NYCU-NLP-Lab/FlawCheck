{"The claim was based on an article published on the website Departed": "which reported that Hillary Clinton's \"latest\" campaign ad depicted her wearing a hijab.", "The expert found that the claim was not based on a new campaign ad": "as the same claim had been made back in October 2015. The image of Clinton wearing a hijab was actually a screen capture from a promotional campaign video tweeted by the Clinton campaign in October 2015.", "The image of Clinton wearing a hijab was taken from coverage of her 2009 visit to Pakistan": "during which she donned a head covering while visiting a shrine and a mosque. This was in accordance with the custom of covering one's head in certain religious sites.", "The context of the image was widely shared out of context to suggest that Clinton regularly wore a hijab as part of her ordinary attire": "but it was clear that the footage was captured during a specific visit to a location where wearing a head covering was expected by custom."}
