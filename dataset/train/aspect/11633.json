{"The origin of the claim": "The expert's verdict highlights that the claim originated from a thread on the \"pol\" section of the 4chan imageboard website. The thread requested users to find negative information about Christine Blasey Ford to discredit her.", "Source of the image": "The photograph in question was taken by photographer Christopher Penler on November 12, 2016, during an anti-Trump protest in New York City. The image is available on various stock photograph websites and is consistently presented as an image of an anonymous woman with a \"Not My President\" sign.", "Comparison of images": "The expert compared the image of Christine Blasey Ford with the woman in the meme and found that they do not bear much resemblance. This comparison further supports the conclusion that the claim is not authentic.", "Inaccurate association": "The claim falsely associates another image, purportedly showing Ford at a different Trump protest, with the same user who posted the initial photograph. However, the second photograph features a completely different woman named Liz Darner, taken at a different event called the March for Science in April 2017. This incorrect association further discredits the claim."}
