I've never cast a vote to shut down the government.\" This is the claim that is being evaluated for authenticity.", "Lack of formal": "shutdown vote\": The expert explains that there is no formal \"shutdown vote\" that can be used to verify Rep. Cramer's claim. Instead, a government shutdown occurs when appropriations bills are not passed or temporary spending authority expires.", "Votes indirectly resulting in a shutdown": "The expert mentions that Rep. Cramer has cast votes in 2013 that indirectly resulted in a government shutdown. These votes were related to Republicans' opposition to funding President Obama's Affordable Care Act.", "Procedural votes and party lines": "The expert highlights that most of the votes related to potential government shutdowns were procedural in nature, and Rep. Cramer voted along party lines. This suggests that although he may not have directly voted for a government shutdown, his votes aligned with actions that could lead to a shutdown."}
