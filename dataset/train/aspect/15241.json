{"The claim originated from a screenshot published by the outlet Mic": "which did not have an accompanying article or content. This lack of supporting information raises questions about the credibility of the claim.", "The headline and image used in the claim closely matched an item published by HelloFlo": "a business selling menstrual care products. This suggests that the claim may have been sensationalized for marketing purposes rather than being based on factual information.", "The American Academy of Family Physicians defines dysmenorrhea": "the clinical term for painful menstruation, as a condition severe enough to interfere with daily activities in up to 20% of women. This provides some support for the claim that menstrual cramps can be extremely painful.", "The claim relied heavily on the quote from a single professor of reproductive health": "John Guillebaud, who stated that it is possible for menstrual cramping to be as bad as a heart attack. However, the use of a single source and the absence of quotes from multiple doctors diminishes the credibility of the claim."}
