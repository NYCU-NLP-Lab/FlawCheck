{"Confirmation from a spokesperson": "A spokesperson for U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert confirmed that she earned her GED diploma in 2020. This provides direct verification of the claim.", "Boebert": "s own statement: Boebert herself discussed her education in an interview with Colorado's Durango Herald in September 2020. She explained that she was a new mother at the time and prioritized raising her family over her education. She also mentioned that she received her GED after completing a four-course review. This personal statement adds credibility to the claim.", "Mention of Boebert": "s educational background: It is mentioned that Boebert never claimed to have graduated from Rifle High School, indicating that she did not obtain a traditional high school diploma. This reinforces the fact that she earned her GED instead.", "Comparison to other politicians": "The expert's verdict highlights that Boebert is not the first person elected to office without a college education. A report from the Congressional Research Service states that 17 Members of the House have no educational degree beyond a high school diploma. This comparison provides context and further supports the authenticity of Boebert's claim."}
