{"Presentation at the International Association of Volcanology and Chemistry of the Earth": "s Interior conference: The claim was based on a presentation made by Hannah Shamloo, a PhD candidate from Arizona State University, at a reputable conference in August 2017. The presentation was co-authored by Christy Till, a professor at Arizona State University.", "High": "resolution chemical sampling: The research involved the use of high-resolution chemical sampling techniques on crystals found trapped in rocks. This method is similar to reading past climate information from tree rings and is designed to uncover the nature and timing of chemical changes occurring in magma chambers prior to eruptions.", "Analysis of the most recent supereruption": "The specific focus of the research was the most recent supereruption from the Yellowstone caldera, which occurred 631,000 years ago. By analyzing crystals at an incredibly detailed resolution, the researchers were able to draw conclusions about the timing and nature of chemical changes that occurred prior to the eruption.", "Consistency with existing predictions": "The expert's verdict emphasizes that the research does not change predictions about the likelihood of a supereruption happening within our lifetimes. The risk of a catastrophic super-eruption from the Yellowstone caldera remains exceedingly low, and the research findings are consistent with this understanding."}
