{"The blog post from Liberty Counsel falsely claimed that Kansas City officials required every church to submit a list of members and attendees": "including their personal information, to city officials for tracking and surveillance purposes.", "The mayor did issue an order that would have required churches to keep attendance lists at their gatherings": "but this order was later revised to make the lists voluntary, not mandatory.", "The purpose of the attendance lists was to assist health officials in contact tracing efforts": "in case a coronavirus outbreak was tied to a particular gathering.", "Churchgoers were never required to register with the government": "contrary to the claim made in the blog post."}
