{"The expert": "s explanation of the crow's behavior: The expert, Kevin McGowan, explains that the crow landing on the eagle is similar to a dog chasing a car and jumping on it. He states that dogs always want to catch the car but don't know what they would do if they actually caught it.", "The lack of reaction from the eagle": "The expert points out that since the crow wasn't pecking, it didn't warrant the eagle's attention. Eagles are constantly harassed by birds of all species, and sometimes they are so used to it that it appears as if they are being followed by mosquitoes.", "Similar occurrences captured in other photographs": "The expert mentions that other images of crows \"riding\" eagles can be found online. They provide an example of a photographer who captured a similar occurrence in South Korea, where a crow hovered above an eagle and then latched onto its back. The photographer even suggests that the eagle and the crow might have been friends.", "The photographer": "s explanation: The photographer, Phoo Chan, offers an explanation on his 500px page. He mentions that crows are known for aggressively harassing larger raptors in their territories, but in this case, the crow didn't seem to harass the eagle, and the eagle didn't mind the crow's presence. He describes it as the crow taking a brief stop on the eagle's back as if it was taking a free scenic ride, and the eagle simply obliged."}
