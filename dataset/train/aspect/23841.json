{"Changes in law regarding nonviolent drug offenders": "The expert's verdict highlights that Rick Perry, the governor of Texas, acknowledged the changes in law as a significant factor in the decrease in crime rates. Perry mentioned the creation of local drug courts and diversion programs that treat drug addiction as a disease, which suggests a shift in the approach towards nonviolent drug offenders.", "Closure of three prisons": "Perry stated that as a result of the policy changes, three prisons were shut down. This indicates that there has been a decrease in repeat offenses by drug offenders, further supporting the claim of a lower crime rate.", "Texas crime rates data": "The expert refers to a chart provided by gubernatorial spokesman Felix Browne, which draws from FBI-collected data. This data shows that in 2013, Texas had its lowest overall crime index since 1968, with the lowest property crime rate and violent crime rate since 1968 and 1977, respectively. The data supports the claim that Texas has the lowest crime rate in the state since 1968.", "Support from criminologists": "Criminologists who were consulted by the expert agreed that Perry's claim is supported by the total Texas crime index. The fact that experts in the field validate the claim adds credibility to the authenticity of the claim."}
