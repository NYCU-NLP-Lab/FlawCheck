This indicates that the image is unrelated to the bushfires in Australia.", "The red tinting observed in the clouds was determined to be a natural atmospheric phenomenon and not a result of any fires": "This further supports the fact that the photograph does not depict the bushfires in Australia.", "The expert rates the claim as": "Miscaptioned\" because the photograph is unrelated to either Australia or bushfires, as falsely claimed on social media.
