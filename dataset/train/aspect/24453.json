{"The state of Pennsylvania has implemented a three": "phase reopening plan, with all 67 counties currently in the \"green\" phase since July 3. This phase allows most businesses to operate at 75% capacity and gives school districts the authority to decide whether to offer in-person instruction.", "Despite the ongoing COVID": "19 pandemic and increasing case counts, Pennsylvania has not imposed any new restrictions, as confirmed by the state's Secretary of Health, Rachel Levine, as recently as October 14.", "Some counties in Pennsylvania": "such as Philadelphia, Delaware, Berks, and Centre, have reported high case counts, with more than 2,000 cases per 100,000 residents, exceeding the state's safety threshold. Additionally, two dozen other counties have reported more than 1,000 cases per 100,000 residents.", "Although day": "to-day life in Pennsylvania has not returned to normal, the claim that the state \"never reopened\" is inaccurate. The closure of non-life-sustaining businesses and the implementation of stay-at-home orders in March were followed by a gradual reopening process, with counties moving from \"red\" to \"yellow\" and eventually to the least restrictive \"green\" phase."}
