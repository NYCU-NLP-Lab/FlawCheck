{"Lack of evidence": "The expert's verdict mentions that despite efforts to find evidence of Yosemite Sam being banned from television, no trace of such a ban could be found in any news archive. This lack of evidence casts doubt on the authenticity of the claim.", "Comparison with Speedy Gonzales": "The expert's verdict highlights the temporary disappearance of another Looney Tunes character, Speedy Gonzales, and the campaign to bring him back to television. By contrasting the situation with Speedy Gonzales, it suggests that if Yosemite Sam had indeed been banned, there would likely be similar evidence or campaigns surrounding his return.", "Historical context": "The expert's verdict mentions articles from 1999 through 2002 that reported on the temporary disappearance of Speedy Gonzales. This historical context provides a basis for comparison and suggests that if Yosemite Sam had been banned, it would likely have been reported during a similar time frame.", "Opinion of a Slate writer": "The expert's verdict includes a quote from a Slate writer who discusses concerns about video game violence but does not suggest banning vintage Looney Tunes cartoons. This opinion reinforces the idea that there is no widespread call or evidence for banning such cartoons, further undermining the claim about Yosemite Sam's ban."}
