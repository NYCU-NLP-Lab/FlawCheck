{"Social media posts": "One aspect used to verify the authenticity of the claim was the presence of multiple social media posts, including tweets by BJP MP Satyadev Pachauri and the official handle of Sudarshan News, stating that BJP lost 36 seats in the Delhi assembly elections by a margin of fewer than 2000 votes.", "Keyword search": "Another aspect employed was a relevant keyword search on Twitter, which led to the discovery of the tweet by Sudarshan News that originated the claim. This search helped in finding additional sources and information related to the claim.", "News article": "The Hindustan Times article published on February 12 provided further evidence to verify the claim. The article stated that there were close fights on at least 13 constituencies in the Delhi assembly elections, with victory margins ranging from below 7,000 votes to as low as 753. This information supported the claim that there were close contests in the elections.", "Election Commission data": "The final aspect used to verify the claim was cross-checking the data available on the official website of the Election Commission of India. This data confirmed that only two BJP candidates lost the elections with a margin below 2000 votes, contradicting the false claim made by BJP MP Satyadev Pachauri."}
