{"Hemp and marijuana are forms of the same species": "but hemp has a negligible amount of THC, the high-inducing chemical found in marijuana. This aspect verifies the claim that hiding marijuana in a hemp field would render it worthless because hemp has very little THC.", "Rep": "Larry Yarborough, a Republican from Roxboro, stated that if a marijuana plant gets pollen from hemp and goes to seed, it becomes worthless, and the THC goes away. This statement aligns with mainstream research and supports the claim.", "Two professors who have studied hemp in other states and a 2015 report by the federal government all concluded that anyone trying to hide marijuana inside a hemp field is not a smart criminal": "This expert consensus further verifies the claim.", "Proposed regulations on the hemp industry include limiting the amount of land hemp can be grown on": "requiring the disclosure of hemp field locations to law enforcement agencies, allowing inspections of hemp fields at any time, and making it a felony to use hemp to hide marijuana. These regulations reflect concerns about the potential for marijuana to be hidden in hemp fields, supporting the claim that such an act is a possibility."}
