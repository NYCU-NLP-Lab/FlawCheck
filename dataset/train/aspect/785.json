{"The expert": "s verdict highlights that the claim was based on inaccurate reports and misleading headlines from the Federalist Papers Project, a conservative website known for peddling falsehoods.", "The expert mentions that even U": "S. Rep. Devin Nunes seemed to promote the false narrative online, further emphasizing the lack of authenticity in the claim.", "The expert explains that the false reports centered around two bills": "Senate Bill 606 and Assembly Bill 1668, signed into law by California Gov. Jerry Brown. These bills aimed to establish strict water budgets for cities, water districts, and agricultural water districts, but did not impose penalties on individual residents for excessive water use.", "The expert clarifies that the claim": "s calculation of 55 gallons of indoor water use per person per day was incorrect, as the legislation actually sets a target of 55 gallons per capita per day for indoor residential water use, which will decrease to 50 gallons by 2030. This refutes the notion that taking a shower and doing laundry on the same day would be illegal under the new law."}
