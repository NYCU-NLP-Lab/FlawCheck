{"The expert verified the claim by checking the U": "S. Treasury Department figures on the size of the national debt, which showed that the debt stood at $10.6 trillion when Obama took office and was $19.5 trillion on the day Trump made his statement. This confirmed that the debt had indeed increased significantly during Obama's presidency.", "The expert also considered the growth rate of the debt over the past year": "which was more than $1 trillion. This supported Trump's estimate that the debt would be \"close to $20 trillion\" by the end of Obama's term, indicating a doubling of the debt during his presidency.", "The expert acknowledged that there are different ways to measure the national debt": "including considering only the amount of debt held by the public. By this measure, the debt had still more than doubled from $6.3 trillion to $14.1 trillion during Obama's presidency.", "The expert highlighted that while Obama played a role in proposing and signing spending bills": "the rise in the debt was not solely his responsibility. Other factors, such as the Great Recession and the need for Congress to pass spending bills, also contributed to the increase in the debt. This provided a more nuanced perspective on the claim, indicating that Obama was not solely to blame for the debt doubling."}
