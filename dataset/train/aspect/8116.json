{"The expert verified the claim by checking the statements made by U": "S. Rep. Phil Gingrey during a state legislative committee meeting on immigration. This involved examining the video conference transmission from Washington on Dec. 16 where Gingrey made the claim about one person with a green card being able to bring in more than 270 relatives.", "The expert contacted Gingrey": "s office for evidence to support the claim. Although the office referred them to NumbersUSA, a nonprofit group advocating for lower immigration levels, no specific cases were provided as evidence. However, the expert considered the concept of \"chain migration\" explained by Roy Beck, the executive director of NumbersUSA, where immigrants can bring their relatives to the U.S. through U.S. rules and regulations.", "The expert checked the calculations and assumptions made by NumbersUSA to estimate the number of relatives that could follow a legal immigrant": "They examined the group's use of immigration rules, fertility rates for less-developed countries, and assumptions about family size and immigration patterns. The expert accepted these assumptions for the purpose of verifying the claim.", "The expert acknowledged certain limitations in the verification process": "such as assuming no visa processing waits and no immigration backlogs. These assumptions were made to provide a clearer picture of the claim being analyzed."}
