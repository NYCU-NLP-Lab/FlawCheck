{"The quote is fabricated": "The expert's verdict states that the claim, which includes a quote from Hillary Clinton, is wholly fabricated. This means that the authenticity of the claim is immediately called into question.", "Lack of evidence": "The expert points out that there is no evidence to support the claim that Hillary Clinton made the statement in question. They mention that Clinton was not in Iowa on the date specified and that a review of the Des Moines Register's archives does not show any direct interview or quote from Clinton on that day or in the days immediately following.", "Clinton": "s actual statements on gun control: The expert highlights that while the fabricated quote suggests Clinton's intention to shut down the National Rifle Association (NRA) and ban handguns, her actual statements on gun control during her Iowa campaign trail focused on broader background-check requirements and stronger measures to prevent gun purchases by domestic abusers and individuals with mental health problems. This contrast further discredits the authenticity of the claim.", "Inaccurate timing": "The expert mentions that Clinton's first visit to Iowa in the month of August occurred on August 14, followed by public events on August 15 and August 26. This contradicts the claim's assertion that Clinton made the statement to the Des Moines Register on August 8, 2015."}
