{"Confirmation from FEMA spokesperson": "A FEMA spokesperson confirmed via email that the claim stating \"FEMA is paying for hotel rooms!!!\" for Texas winter storm victims is false. This confirmation from an official source adds credibility to the verdict.", "Twitter statement from FEMA Region 6": "FEMA Region 6, which includes Texas, tweeted a statement on February 18, debunking the claim and labeling it as a scam. The tweet emphasized that the best information on legitimate sources of help in the area would come from local officials and the Texas Department of Emergency Management (TDEM).", "Retweet by Texas Division of Emergency Management": "The Texas Division of Emergency Management retweeted FEMA's warning about the scam, further reinforcing the authenticity of the debunking. This retweet indicates that the local emergency management agency also recognizes the claim as false.", "Inaccurate information on the provided 800 number": "Upon calling the 800 number mentioned in the Facebook post, an automated message clarified that it is the FEMA Internet Technical Help Desk, not a helpline for individuals seeking assistance for the winter storm in Texas. This discrepancy in the information provided in the post adds to the evidence against the claim's authenticity."}
