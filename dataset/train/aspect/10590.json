{"The expert mentions two independent polls conducted by CBS News and the New York Times": "as well as the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press, which aimed to gauge the opinions of NRA households on universal background checks. These polls found that between 74 percent and 85 percent of those living in NRA households favored background checks for all potential gun buyers.", "The expert highlights that the polls were conducted before the relevant pieces of legislation were filed in the Senate": "This suggests that while the polls demonstrate a majority of support for universal background checks among NRA households, it doesn't directly verify the claim that a \"wide majority of NRA households supported this legislation.\"", "The expert mentions President Obama": "s remarks in the White House's Rose Garden, where he invoked the National Rifle Association (NRA) and called upon the majority of NRA households to let their leadership and lobbyists know they didn't represent their views on the issue. This indicates that President Obama believed there was significant support for the legislation among NRA households.", "The expert points out that the presence of relatives of slain children from Newtown": "Conn., and assassination survivor Gabby Giffords, who stood alongside President Obama during his remarks, emphasized the broad support for expanded background checks among Americans. This suggests that the inclusion of these individuals aimed to demonstrate the authenticity of the claim and the widespread backing for the legislation."}
