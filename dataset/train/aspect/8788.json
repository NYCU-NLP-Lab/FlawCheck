{"The quote attributed to John Elway was traced back to a satirical website": "PotatriotsUnite.com, which clearly states that everything on its website is fiction.", "Multiple websites": "such as Prep-101.com and Conservative Republic, copied and pasted the fabricated story without providing any disclaimer that it was made up.", "People commenting on these websites seemed to believe the story was real": "expressing support for John Elway's supposed stance on firing players who kneel during the national anthem.", "John Elway himself has publicly stated in the past that he believes in standing for the national anthem": "but he has also expressed support for players using their platform to bring about positive change. He has never mentioned firing players for kneeling during the anthem."}
