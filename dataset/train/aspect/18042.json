{"Calculation of debt figures": "The expert used the Treasury Department's \"Debt to the Penny\" calculator to determine the public debt and gross federal debt figures for both the start and end of President Obama's term.", "Comparison to previous presidents": "The expert compared the debt accumulated under President Obama to that of his 43 predecessors, taking into account the cumulative debt levels on the day Obama was inaugurated.", "Consideration of different measures of debt": "The expert mentioned that there are two common measures of debt - public debt and gross federal debt. Both measures were taken into account to provide a comprehensive analysis of the claim.", "Acknowledgment of logical allocation": "The expert acknowledged that attributing all the debt accumulated under Obama solely to him is not a logical allocation, as he inherited the fiscal legacy of his predecessor. However, for the simplicity of analysis, the expert assumed this allocation and noted that it would not significantly impact the outcome."}
