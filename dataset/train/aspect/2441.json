{"Calculation of the number of kittens": "The expert used a calculator to determine the number of kittens a male cat would have to father in order to reach the claimed number of 420,000 in five years. By considering the average number of kittens in a litter and the total number of days in five years, the expert concluded that the claim was mathematically incorrect.", "Source of the statistic": "The expert investigated the source of the claim and found that it originated from Rita Falaguerra of Cat Adoption Team Services, who allegedly obtained the statistic from the state veterinarian, Peter Belinsky. The expert examined the credibility of these sources and their knowledge on the subject matter.", "Verification through literature": "The expert conducted research and found a 1993 article published in the Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association, which discussed similar claims about the reproductive potential of cats. The expert analyzed the findings of this article to determine if it supported or contradicted the claim in question.", "Comparison with other sources": "The expert cross-referenced the claim with information from other reputable sources, such as the Pet Health Network, the ASPCA, and mainstream media outlets. By comparing the differing versions of the claim and the reproduction potential of female cats, the expert sought to establish the accuracy and consistency of the statistic."}
