{"The claim was based on the monthly jobs report issued by the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development": "which stated that the state had added an estimated 8,400 jobs in September 2014.", "The claim was supported by Governor Scott Walker": "who cited the report in a speech to the League of Wisconsin Municipalities, emphasizing that it was the largest private-sector job creation in September in over a decade.", "The claim was compared to historical data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics": "which showed that September 2014 had the highest job gain in the past decade, surpassing other years in terms of job growth.", "The experts acknowledged that the September jobs report is preliminary and subject to revision": "as it is based on a monthly survey with a margin of error. However, they considered it reasonable to compare the preliminary numbers with prior years to evaluate the claim's authenticity."}
