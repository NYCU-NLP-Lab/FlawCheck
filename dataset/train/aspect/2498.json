{"The expert identified that the photograph of the storm over Sydney was a composite of at least two different images": "indicating that it was not an authentic representation of a storm in Sydney.", "The expert discovered that the photograph of the Sydney cityscape used in the composite image was taken by photographer Rudy Blasko and shared on his Instagram page in April 2017": "This original image depicted Sydney's Lavender Bay at sunset, not during a major storm.", "The storm clouds in the viral picture were found to be a distorted version of a photograph available via Adobe Stock": "supposedly showing a supercell that formed in Colorado in 2013. The original cloud photograph was flipped and stretched before being inserted into the viral image.", "While the authenticity of the original photograph depicting a genuine storm is uncertain": "the expert explained that supercell clouds, similar to the ones depicted in the viral image, are real and can produce impressive thunderstorms with rotating updrafts, torrential rain, high winds, and even tornadoes. The expert referenced NASA's description of supercell clouds and their characteristics."}
