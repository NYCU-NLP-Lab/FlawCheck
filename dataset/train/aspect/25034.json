{"Lack of scientific evidence": "The expert's verdict emphasizes that there is no scientific evidence to support the claim that gargling with salt water or vinegar can eliminate the COVID-19 coronavirus from the throat. This lack of evidence undermines the authenticity of the claim.", "Inaccurate information about virus behavior": "The expert highlights that the claim falsely states that the virus remains in the throat for four days before reaching the lungs. This contradicts the known incubation period of the virus, which is estimated to be about five days on average. The inaccurate information further questions the credibility of the claim.", "World Health Organization": "s statement: The expert refers to the World Health Organization (WHO) and their official statement regarding the use of saline rinsing for preventing respiratory infections. The WHO clearly states that there is no evidence that rinsing the nose or gargling with saline can protect against the new coronavirus. This authoritative source contradicts the claim and adds to its lack of authenticity.", "Limited benefits for common cold": "The expert mentions that there is limited evidence suggesting that regularly rinsing the nose with saline can help people recover more quickly from the common cold. However, it is important to note that this does not apply to preventing respiratory infections. This distinction highlights the inapplicability of gargling with salt water or vinegar for COVID-19 prevention, further diminishing the claim's authenticity."}
