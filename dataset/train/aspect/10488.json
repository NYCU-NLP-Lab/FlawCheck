Bush's presidency, specifically November through January, before Barack Obama took office on January 20, 2009.", "The expert analyzed the Bureau of Labor Statistics": "BLS) data to verify the accuracy of Wasserman Schultz's claim. The BLS data showed that during the specified time period, the economy did indeed experience significant job losses. The expert noted that Wasserman Schultz chose the three worst months of the Bush presidency, which resulted in higher job losses. However, if a longer period or the last full year of Bush's presidency was considered, the average job losses would have been lower.", "The expert also highlighted that Wasserman Schultz": "s statement did not mention the initial months of Obama's presidency, during which the economy continued to shed jobs at or above the 700,000 mark.
