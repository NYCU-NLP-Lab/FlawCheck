{"Testimony from U": "S. Rep. Marcia Fudge: U.S. Rep. Marcia Fudge, D-Ohio, stated during a hearing that South Carolina bought the voting machines that Ohio got rid of because they were ineffective. This claim was made in the context of discussing the need for regulations and funding for voting machines.", "Denial from South Carolina Election Commission": "Harrison Brant, the commission's general counsel, explicitly denied the claim that South Carolina purchased machines discarded by Ohio. He stated that South Carolina bought new machines in 2004, which were not previously used in Ohio.", "South Carolina": "s purchase of iVotronic machines: In 2004, South Carolina spent $34 million to purchase 12,000 iVotronic machines from Election Systems & Software. These machines were new at the time of purchase and were used statewide starting in 2006. This contradicts the claim that South Carolina bought machines discarded by Ohio.", "Ohio": "s review of electronic voting technology: In 2007, the Ohio Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner released a comprehensive review of Ohio's electronic voting technology, which also questioned the security of South Carolina's machines. This indicates that Ohio was not satisfied with the effectiveness of the machines they had at that time, but it does not provide evidence that South Carolina purchased those specific machines."}
