{"U": "S. Rep. Sean Duffy's claim that President Barack Obama's homeland security budget had \"$16 million to fight climate change\" but \"didn't have a line item to fight violent extremism\" was made during an interview on the talk show \"Varney & Co.\" on Fox Business Network.", "The Department of Homeland Security": "s budget for fiscal year 2016 included $16 million for climate change, as found by fact-checkers.", "The Department of Homeland Security does not have a specific line item in its budget for fighting violent extremists": "but it does allocate funds to combat violent extremism as part of its overall spending.", "While Duffy": "s claim about the lack of a line item for fighting violent extremism may be misleading, it is true that more money was dedicated to climate change within the Department of Homeland Security than to combating Islamist terrorists radicalizing over the internet in the United States."}
