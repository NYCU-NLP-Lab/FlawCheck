{"The claim is based on a Facebook post that has been shared more than 10": "000 times since June 23, 2020. The post includes a caption stating that a man was arrested for raping a goat and the goat gave birth to a lamb with a human face. This information is used to establish the origin of the claim and its dissemination on social media.", "The claim is accompanied by two photographs": "One shows a man being led away by the arm, while the other shows a small furry creature with hooves and vaguely human facial features. These images are used as visual evidence to support the claim.", "A reverse image search of the first photo in the claim reveals previous reports from 2018 about the arrest of a man for the alleged rape of a pregnant goat": "This information is used to provide context and show that there is a real but unrelated event that the claim draws from.", "The expert mentions that the second photograph in the claim": "showing a deformed baby goat, is unrelated to the first photo and is actually from a different incident in Malaysia. Malaysian veterinarians had tested the stillborn remains of the deformed goat in 2016 and concluded that the deformity was a genetic abnormality with no human DNA. This information is used to debunk the claim and provide a scientific explanation for the deformed goat."}
