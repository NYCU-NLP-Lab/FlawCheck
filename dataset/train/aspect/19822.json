{"The claim is based on the argument made by Ed Fallone": "a law professor at Marquette University, who stated that incivility among the Wisconsin Supreme Court justices has led to reduced productivity and a decrease in the number of opinions being decided in civil and criminal cases.", "The claim is supported by incidents of conflict among the justices": "such as the highly publicized confrontation between Justice Ann Walsh Bradley and Justice David Prosser in June 2011. This incident, along with previous instances of rancor on the court, suggests a dysfunctional working environment.", "The claim can be tested by analyzing the number of opinions issued by the Supreme Court during specific terms": "According to state court information officer Tom Sheehan, the court has issued an average of 65 opinions in civil and criminal cases per year during the 2006-2007 through 2011-2012 terms.", "The claim also takes into account the potential impact of replacing Justice Pat Roggensack": "who has been on the court since April 2003. Fallone argues that if he were to replace Roggensack, relations among the justices would improve, potentially leading to a more productive court."}
