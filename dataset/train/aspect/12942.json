{"The video clip was deceptively edited": "cutting an hour-long speech down to less than one minute and retaining only parts of statements and pauses between words.", "The clip": "s title, \"Biden gets location wrong, sounds lost,\" was misleading as it did not accurately represent the content of the speech.", "The clip spliced together different parts of Biden": "s remarks, omitting important context and selectively using moments where he said \"um\" or \"uh.\"", "The clip failed to include the full answer to a question about why Biden chose to speak from Delaware": "which provided additional context and explanation for his decision."}
