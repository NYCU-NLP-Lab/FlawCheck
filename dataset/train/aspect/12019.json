{"The city government of Paris was fined nearly": "110,000 for its hiring practices, specifically for hiring too many women in senior positions.", "The fine was imposed because the city government had broken national rules on gender parity in its 2018 staffing": "These rules required that no more than 60% of one gender be appointed to top civil service positions in a given year.", "The hiring drive to increase the number of women in senior positions was carried out in 2018": "before the amendment to the law was put in place. As a result, 69% of the jobs went to women, which exceeded the gender parity requirement.", "The mayor of Paris": "Anne Hidalgo, expressed pride in her efforts to hire women and sarcastically referred to the situation as the city hall becoming \"far too feminist.\" However, she also called the decision to impose a fine \"absurd\" and stated that she would deliver the amount herself to the head of the ministry of public affairs."}
