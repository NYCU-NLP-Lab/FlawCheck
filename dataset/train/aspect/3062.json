Health and Human Services Department did not provide an estimate on how much refugees receive per month under U.S. programs, indicating that the specific amount mentioned in the claim is unsupported.", "Refugee assistance in the United States is time": "limited, with programs such as Refugee Cash Assistance (RCA) and Refugee Medical Assistance (RMA) available for up to eight months from their date of arrival.", "The amount and type of federal assistance provided to refugees during their eligibility period can vary greatly": "as cash and medical assistance are handled at the state level and the state cost-sharing amounts vary significantly."}
