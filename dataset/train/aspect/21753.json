{"The expert": "s research focused specifically on women under 30, as the claim stated that more than half of women under 30 who give birth do so outside of marriage. The CDC records from 2005 to 2009 show that the percentage of babies born to unmarried women under 30 has steadily increased, reaching 54 percent in 2009.", "The CDC data shows that the proportion of babies born to unmarried mothers has generally increased over the last 75 years": "In 1940, only 3.8 percent of all births were to unmarried women, but by 2009, this had risen to 41 percent.", "The expert also consulted other sources": "such as Isabell Sawhill, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, who provided additional insights into the long-term increases in births outside of marriage. Sawhill mentioned that the decline in marriage rates and the increased opportunities for women to support themselves and their children outside of marriage are contributing factors to this trend. The U.S. Census Bureau's report from 2013 also supported the finding that about half of unmarried mothers under 30 gave birth without being married in 2010 and 2011."}
