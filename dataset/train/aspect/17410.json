{"The claim that": "Gov. Walker has yet to create a job\" was evaluated by examining the job growth statistics since Walker took office in January 2011. The Department of Workforce Development statistics showed a net gain of more than 13,000 jobs in January and February, although it was acknowledged that Walker's policies may not have had a significant impact in that short time frame.", "The claim that Walker": "raises taxes on working people\" was also not directly addressed in the expert's verdict. It is unclear whether this aspect was investigated or if there was insufficient evidence provided to evaluate its authenticity.", "The expert": "s verdict emphasized the importance of considering the economic cycle and the role it plays in job growth or loss, suggesting that attributing job gains or losses solely to individual politicians may not provide a complete picture. This aspect highlights the need to consider broader economic factors when evaluating claims related to job creation."}
