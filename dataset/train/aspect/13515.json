{"The length and content of the FEC report": "The expert mentions that Trump's FEC filing is 92 pages long, indicating that it contains detailed information about his assets and financial status. This suggests that the FEC report provides more detailed information than a tax return.", "Accuracy and validation": "The expert points out that a personal financial disclosure report (PFD), which is filed with the FEC, is not audited by any government agency. This means that the accuracy of the information provided in the PFD is solely the responsibility of the candidate. In contrast, a tax return is audited, ensuring that the numbers provided for each income-earning asset are precise.", "Inclusion of non": "income-earning assets: The expert highlights that a tax return only includes assets that generate income, whereas a PFD includes all of the candidate's assets, regardless of whether they generate income. This difference in scope suggests that the FEC report provides a more comprehensive view of the candidate's financial situation.", "Purpose and design of the documents": "The expert explains that the PFD is designed to disclose potential financial conflicts of interest, requiring greater disclosure of assets. On the other hand, a tax return focuses on reporting income and is not intended to provide the same level of asset detail as a PFD. This distinction in purpose and design further emphasizes the differences between the two documents."}
