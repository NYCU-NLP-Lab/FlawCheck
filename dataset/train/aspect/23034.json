{"Comparison to 1990": "The expert mentions that the claim of no net growth in the federal workforce is compared to the workforce size in 1990. This aspect involves examining the workforce numbers from that time period to verify the accuracy of the claim.", "Government employment data": "The expert refers to data from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics to support their verdict. These sources provide information on the total federal government employment over the years, allowing for a comparison and verification of the claim.", "Exclusion of military personnel": "The expert highlights the importance of excluding military personnel from the workforce numbers when assessing the claim. By considering only civilian employees, a more accurate evaluation of the growth or decline in the federal workforce can be made.", "Expert opinion": "The expert quotes Paul Light, a professor of public service at New York University, who states that the federal workforce significantly decreased between 1989 and 2009 due to cuts following the end of the Cold War. This expert opinion adds another aspect to the verification process, providing additional evidence to support or challenge the claim."}
