The expert's verdict confirms that Castro did receive a substantial referral fee from Watts, but this occurred when Castro was in private practice, not while he was serving as mayor.", "The expert": "s verdict includes a timeline of Castro's career, which shows that he served as mayor of San Antonio from 2009 to 2014.
