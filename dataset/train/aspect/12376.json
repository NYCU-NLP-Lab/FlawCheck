{"Lack of evidence": "The expert's verdict clearly states that there is no evidence to support the claim that Hillary Clinton was involved in the Oklahoma City bombing or that the bombing was related to the Whitewater scandal. This lack of evidence is a crucial aspect in verifying the authenticity of the claim.", "Timing discrepancy": "The expert's verdict highlights that there is no indication that Hillary Clinton was going to be indicted four days before the bombing occurred. In fact, she was interviewed as part of the Whitewater investigation three days after the bombing. This discrepancy in timing undermines the credibility of the claim.", "Official denials": "Government officials denied that any documents related to the Whitewater investigation were located in the Oklahoma City building that was bombed. This denial, as reported in a 1995 Washington Post article, contradicts the claim that all documents were lost in the bombing. The official denials serve as an important aspect in verifying the inauthenticity of the claim.", "Location and purpose of the building": "According to a state government report issued after the bombing, the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building housed various government offices and agencies, such as the General Services Administration, Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Transportation, Social Security Administration, and more. These offices were not directly related to the Whitewater investigation, further undermining the claim that the bombing was intended to destroy Whitewater-related documents. The location and purpose of the building provide additional evidence against the claim's authenticity."}
