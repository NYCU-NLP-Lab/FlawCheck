{"The claim that Ted Strickland destroyed Ohio jobs when he busted the budget and raised taxes was examined by PolitiFact Ohio": "2. PolitiFact Ohio found that the claim that Ohio lost nearly 400,000 jobs under Strickland's governorship did not reflect the larger economic backdrop of a national recession and a steady loss of Ohio jobs since January 2000.", "PolitiFact Ohio also examined the charge that Strickland raised taxes on Ohioans and found that he had frozen a five": "year, 21-percent income tax cut, which saved the state approximately $840 million. However, there were no guarantees that the tax cut would be unfrozen in the future.", "The Kasich campaign argued that Strickland tried to fill a budget hole with slot machines and racetracks": "reneged on his pledge not to raise taxes, and raised taxes by $840 million in a recession. However, it was not clear what \"busted the budget\" meant or how Strickland was responsible for it, as the state budget is a shared responsibility between the governor and the General Assembly."}
