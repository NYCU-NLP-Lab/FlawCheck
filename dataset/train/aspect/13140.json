{"Data from the U": "S. Department of Agriculture: The expert mentions that the data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates a yield of 10.7 billion corn bushels for the market year, with 4.15 billion bushels projected to go towards \"feed and residual use\" and 4.5 billion bushels projected to go towards ethanol production. This data provides quantitative evidence to verify the claim.", "Increase in corn used for ethanol": "The expert mentions that agricultural economists have confirmed that the percentage of corn used for ethanol has been on the rise, driven by renewable fuel standards. This information supports the claim that more corn is being used for ethanol production.", "Distillers dried grains with solubles": "The expert explains that not all of the corn sent to ethanol plants for production ends up as fuel. A third of the corn comes out of the ethanol plant as ethanol feed called distillers dried grains with solubles. This aspect highlights that a portion of the corn used for ethanol production is actually repurposed as animal feed, which contradicts the claim that it is solely used for fuel.", "Impact on corn price and livestock feed supplies": "The expert mentions that U.S. Rep. Bob Goodlatte argues that the Renewable Fuel Standard has contributed to a sharp rise in the price of corn and has tightened supplies of livestock feed. This aspect suggests a potential consequence of the increased use of corn for ethanol production, further supporting the claim."}
