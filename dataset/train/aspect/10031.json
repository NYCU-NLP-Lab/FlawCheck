{"Rep": "Martha McSally's past statements and actions regarding border security: The expert's verdict includes references to McSally's previous comments and votes on the issue of border security, indicating that her stance may have changed over time.", "Kelli Ward": "s accusation and supporting evidence: The expert's verdict mentions Kelli Ward's claim that McSally is a \"flip-flop border hawk\" and provides evidence of Ward's statement, including a Facebook post and a Newsmax article that links McSally's position to her joint statement with Rep. Will Hurd.", "McSally": "s vote on a spending bill: The expert's verdict mentions McSally's vote in favor of a spending bill that included funding for border fencing and wall construction planning, but notes that she primarily praised the bill for its provisions related to defense, veterans, and water. This suggests that McSally's support for border security measures may be conditional or limited."}
