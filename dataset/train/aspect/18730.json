{"State Rep": "Rick Saccone's statement: State Rep. Rick Saccone made a claim during a legislative session that illegal tobacco sales, driven by high prices, have been connected to funding terrorism against the United States in multi-year investigations over the last decade and a half.", "Reference to a State Department report": "Saccone pointed to a 2015 State Department report titled \"The Global Illicit Trade in Tobacco: A Threat to National Security,\" which stated that the illicit trade in tobacco products remains a lucrative revenue stream for criminal actors and illicit networks, fueling transnational crime, corruption, and terrorism.", "Concerns about smuggling rings": "Saccone and State Rep. Russ Diamond expressed concerns that price hikes on cigarettes might encourage smuggling rings, which could potentially be involved in other illegal activities such as human trafficking and funding extremist groups like Hezbollah or ISIS.", "Expert opinion on increased illicit sales": "David Merriman, a University of Chicago researcher, stated that there is high-quality scientific evidence indicating that higher cigarette taxes and prices are associated with increased illicit sales. This suggests that price hikes could potentially contribute to the growth of illegal tobacco sales and, indirectly, to the funding of criminal or terrorist activities."}
