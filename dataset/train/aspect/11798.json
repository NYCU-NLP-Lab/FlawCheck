{"The claim is based on an article published by Jorge Elorza in the University of Pittsburgh Law Review in 2010": "titled \"Secularism and the Constitution: Can Government Be Too Secular?\" The article explores the question of whether scientific evidence that contradicts the existence of a particular aspect of God can be taught in public schools.", "Elorza": "s article defines four views of God: the atheist view, the deist view, the theist view, and the \"memist\" view. He argues that only the theist view can be disproven by science, while the other three views cannot be proven or disproven.", "Elorza focuses on the theist view and argues that it violates the laws of physics": "which can be supported by scientific evidence. He states that teaching that the theist God does not exist would not violate any underlying values.", "Elorza emphasizes that teaching that the other three views of God do not exist would violate the Constitution": "as their existence cannot be proven or disproven. He highlights that teaching something that contradicts a religious belief can be acceptable in public schools if supported by scientific evidence, using the example of evolution."}
