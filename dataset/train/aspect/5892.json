This lack of credible sources raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "CNN denial": "A CNN spokesperson explicitly denies the rumor and states that there is \"absolutely no truth to this rumor.\" This official denial from the network adds to the verification process.", "Pants on Fire rating": "The expert rates the claim as \"Pants on Fire,\" which is the lowest rating on the truthfulness scale.
