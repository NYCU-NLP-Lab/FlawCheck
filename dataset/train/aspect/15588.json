{"The photograph of Ronald Reagan shaking hands with Donald Trump": "taken at the White House on November 3, 1987, during a reception for the \"Friends of Art and Preservation in Embassies\" Foundation in the Blue Room, verifies the visual authenticity of the claim.", "The absence of any record or evidence indicating that Ronald Reagan uttered the quoted phrase about feeling like he was shaking hands with a president when he met Donald Trump suggests that the quote is not authentic": "3. The fact that the quote was only attached to the photograph on social media in July 2016, long after Reagan's death, and was posted on a Facebook page known for sharing hoax stories and fake quotes, casts doubt on its authenticity.", "Statements from Reagan": "s son, Michael Reagan, and analysis by The Washington Post, indicating that Reagan and Trump were not close and that Reagan would likely be confused by Trump's campaign style and treatment of other candidates, provide additional context that questions the veracity of the claim."}
