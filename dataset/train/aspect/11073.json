{"Lack of national data on trust in elections": "The expert states that there isn't much national data available to compare trust in elections over time. Different polls or studies have framed the question differently, and there is no specific data for North Carolina.", "Consistent national polls": "The expert mentions that a pair of national polls stand out for their consistency, and neither indicates that 2018 was the low point of election confidence. One of the sources mentioned is Gallup, which has historical poll data on election confidence dating back to 2004.", "Gallup": "s poll results: The expert cites Gallup's most recent poll, conducted in October, which found that 70 percent of Americans were \"very or somewhat confident\" that votes would be accurately cast and counted in the 2018 midterm elections. This result is slightly higher than Gallup's 2016 results and the historical average of 68 percent confidence.", "Confidence in elections among political parties": "The expert highlights that even within Blue's political party, Gallup found that confidence in elections was not particularly low in the fall of 2018. Gallup's data shows that Americans of the same political party that occupies the White House tend to be more confident in election accuracy. While confidence among Democratic respondents in 2018 was lower than in 2016, it was still higher than confidence rates in previous elections."}
