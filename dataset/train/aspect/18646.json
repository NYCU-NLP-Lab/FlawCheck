{"Historical accounts": "The expert mentions a contemporary account that confirms the crew of the USS Constitution shouted \"Huzzah! Her sides are made of iron!\" after a cannonball bounced off the hull. This suggests that the claim of the ship's imperviousness to cannonballs during the War of 1812 is not entirely accurate.", "Varying details": "The expert notes that some details of the claim vary from teller to teller, indicating a lack of consistency and potentially raising doubts about its authenticity.", "Supplies and events during the voyage": "The expert provides a detailed account of the supplies taken on board during the voyage, including rum obtained from British ships. This suggests that the claim of consuming only liquor and no water during the six-month voyage is unlikely, as the crew would have required other provisions for survival.", "Human tolerance and survival": "The expert explains that the claimed amount of liquor consumed by the crew in six months is highly improbable and would be lethal for individuals. This highlights the physiological limitations of the human body and casts doubt on the claim's authenticity."}
