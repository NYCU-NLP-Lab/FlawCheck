{"The researchers identified a specific mechanism by which capsaicin could combat breast cancer cells": "involving the modulation of a chemical pathway known as transient receptor potential (TRP).", "The study analyzed RNA sequences in numerous breast cancer tissue samples to identify the most common TRP channel in breast cancer cells": "which was found to be TRPV1.", "Capsaicin was shown to induce apoptosis": "cell death) and inhibit the growth of a specific cell line representative of the most aggressive form of breast cancer.", "The significance of the study": "s findings was not that capsaicin specifically fights breast cancer cells, but rather that it identified a biological pathway for potential anti-cancer agents to exploit, specifically the activation of the TRPV1 channel."}
