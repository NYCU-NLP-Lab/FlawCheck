{"Lack of specific company identification": "The claim does not mention any specific company that is offering the free case of baby formula. This raises a red flag as reputable companies would typically make such announcements on their websites or through official channels.", "Confirmation from Aptamil Customer Services": "The Motherload, a Facebook group for mothers, reached out to Aptamil Customer Services and received a response stating that the rumor was false. This confirmation from a reliable source adds credibility to the verdict that the claim is not authentic.", "World Health Organization guidelines": "The spokesperson for Aptamil mentioned that the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines on the promotion of breastmilk substitutes strictly prohibit giving out free milk under any circumstances. This aligns with the claim's assertion that parents can receive a free case of baby formula by calling the number on the back of the product.", "Lack of evidence from other major baby formula brands": "The expert's investigation found no announcements from major baby formula brands like Gerber and Enfamil regarding obtaining baby formula through the method mentioned in the claim. This further supports the conclusion that the claim is not true."}
