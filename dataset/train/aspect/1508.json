{"The claim made by Trump implies that the high number of COVID": "19 cases in the U.S. is due to the country's extensive and advanced testing program.", "The expert": "s verdict highlights that while the U.S. has conducted the most tests in total, it does not have the highest number of tests per capita. This indicates that other countries may be conducting more testing relative to their population.", "The test positivity rate": "which measures the proportion of tests that are positive, is an important indicator of the effectiveness of testing. The U.S. has a test positivity rate of nearly 9%, which is higher than many other countries and suggests that testing may not be sufficient to control the outbreak.", "The expert also mentions limitations in comparing testing statistics between countries": "as different nations report their data differently. Therefore, the numbers may not be directly comparable, but they are considered the best available international data on the subject."}
