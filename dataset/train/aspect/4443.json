However, the cell line used in the vaccine is purified away from the vaccine before it is used.", "The claim originated from a Facebook video posted by the anti": "vaccination group We Are Vaxxed, which falsely asserts that the vaccine contains aborted fetal tissue.", "The video misrepresents a scientific study of the vaccine by selectively reading a portion of the text where the authors describe analyzing the vaccine in": "MRC-5 and A549 cell lines.\" The video then shows the Wikipedia page for MRC-5 cell lines, falsely suggesting a connection between the vaccine and aborted fetal tissue.", "According to an AstraZeneca spokesperson": "the MRC-5 cell line was not used to develop the vaccine. The spokesperson clarified that the vaccine is not made in MRC-5 cells and explained that the cell line was used for analyzing the vaccine's behavior before human testing."}
