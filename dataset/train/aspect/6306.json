However, the letter does not explicitly state that they would personally refuse or encourage active commanders to refuse an illegal order from Trump.", "Support from senior military retirees": "The expert notes that Trump has garnered support from some senior military retirees, including former Defense Intelligence Agency chief Michael T. Flynn and retired Army Maj. Gen. Paul Vallely. This suggests that not all military personnel are opposed to Trump's potential orders."}
