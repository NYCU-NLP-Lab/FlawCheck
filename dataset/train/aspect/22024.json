{"The claim made by Ray Buckley": "the New Hampshire Democratic Party chairman, is that two-thirds of Granite Staters oppose the Tea Party and its agenda on labor unions. This claim is being examined for its authenticity.", "The first aspect employed to verify the claim is the citation of a New Hampshire Tea Party website that strongly endorses legislation weakening unions": "influence by preventing them from collecting dues or fees from nonmembers covered by union contracts. This endorsement supports Buckley's claim that the Tea Party supports a controversial \"right-to-work\" bill.", "The second aspect used to verify the claim is the reference to polls conducted by the University of New Hampshire Survey Center": "These polls reportedly show strong support for the right to collectively bargain, which contradicts the Tea Party's stance on labor unions.", "The third aspect employed to verify the claim is the examination of the New Hampshire Tea Party Coalition": "s news release for a May 25, 2011, rally. This release identifies the \"right to work\" bill as the most important legislation for the future health of the New Hampshire economy. This suggests that the Tea Party is actively advocating for this bill, supporting Buckley's claim of their agenda on labor unions."}
