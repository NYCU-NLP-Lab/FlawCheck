{"Multiple sources have confirmed that the quotes attributed to Congress party leaders regarding the Mandsaur rape case are fake": "The Congress spokesperson, Randeep Surjewala, clarified that Jyotiraditya Scindia never made the statement but called for a CBI enquiry to punish all those involved in the crime.", "The fake quotes have been widely shared on social media platforms": "particularly by right-wing pages such as BJP All India, Yogi Adityanath Ki Sena, Modi Sena, Vote 4 BJP, and We Support Yogi Adityanath. This suggests a deliberate attempt to spread misinformation and create a negative perception of the Congress party.", "Indiaflare": "com, a known purveyor of fake news, published an article on the fake quotes. This website has a history of circulating false information, including a morphed image of Muslims demanding the release of the Mandsaur rapist. This raises doubts about the credibility of the source and the authenticity of the quotes.", "Congress leader Rahul Gandhi was also falsely attributed with the quote": "Muslims can't rape.\" However, there is no evidence or credible source to support this claim. This further highlights the presence of deliberate misinformation and manipulation of statements to serve a particular agenda."}
