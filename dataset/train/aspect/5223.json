{"Inconsistencies in the image": "The expert noted several inconsistencies in the image that raised doubts about its authenticity. These included the unusual shape and attachment of the funnel to the cloud base, the lighting, and the unaffected trees near the tornado.", "Expert analysis": "The expert's verdict highlighted the opinions of two experts in the field. Alex Cooke, an editor for the photography site Fstoppers, noticed something off about the photo while reading a book on tornadoes. Thomas P. Grazulis, an American meteorologist, also expressed skepticism about the photo, suggesting it may have been altered or combined with other images.", "Composite image": "The presence of two people standing yards away from the tornado indicated that the image was likely a composite, created by combining two or more photos. This raised questions about the authenticity of the claim.", "Lack of publication": "The image was sent to the Monthly Weather Review, but the editors of the publication were skeptical about its legitimacy and chose not to publish it. This decision suggests that even experts at the time had doubts about the authenticity of the image."}
