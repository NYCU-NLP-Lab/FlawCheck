{"The claim states that": "black babies die at rates twice as high as white babies because of a lack of access to affordable health care.\" This statement is supported by the expert's verdict, which mentions that infants born to black women had the highest mortality rate of 10.97 deaths per 1,000 live births, compared to 4.67 deaths per 1,000 live births for infants born to non-Hispanic white mothers.", "The expert": "s verdict also mentions that the CDC has identified health-related factors as the leading causes of infant deaths, including disorders related to short gestation (premature birth) and low birthweight, as well as maternal complications. This suggests that addressing these health-related issues through improved access to affordable health care could potentially help reduce the mortality rates among black babies."}
