{"The Pew Hispanic Center": "s 2012 report concluded that the net migration flow from Mexico to the United States has stopped and may have reversed, based on their analysis of federal census data.", "Jeffrey Passel": "a senior demographer at Pew and an expert on Hispanic immigration, confirmed that the claim is true. He explained that the overall size of the unauthorized population living in the U.S. decreased between 2007 and 2009, indicating that the outflow of unauthorized immigrants exceeded inflows during that period.", "The number of unauthorized immigrants changes through four categories": "inflow of new unauthorized immigrants, outflow of those leaving the U.S., deaths, and unauthorized immigrants gaining legal status. The last three categories exceeded the first category by about 900,000 between 2007 and 2009.", "The expert": "s verdict is based on nonpartisan research and analysis, as the Pew Hispanic Center does not take positions on policy issues. Their expertise and data provide a reliable source for verifying the authenticity of the claim."}
