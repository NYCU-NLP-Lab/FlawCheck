{"The claim originated from a junk news site called Neon Nettle": "2. Neon Nettle falsely reported that British Prime Minister Theresa May argued for allowing pedophiles to adopt children.", "The story is a twisted version of a 2010 news report in The Telegraph": "where a reader in law at the London School of Economics called on May to relax rules banning sex offenders from caring for children.", "May": "s spokesperson clarified that she would not consider allowing pedophiles to adopt children and that the vetting review would not be considering such a proposal."}
