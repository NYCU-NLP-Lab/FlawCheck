{"Mayor Cory Booker": "s statement: The first aspect that was employed to verify the authenticity of the claim is the statement made by Mayor Cory Booker himself. The expert's verdict mentions that Booker appeared at a Planned Parenthood rally and explicitly stated that the Republican leadership's budget slashed funding to Planned Parenthood, resulting in the reduction of hours, elimination of days, and elimination of access to women in his city and state. This statement serves as the basis for verifying the claim.", "Budget cuts by Governor Chris Christie": "The second aspect is the budget cuts implemented by Governor Chris Christie. The expert's verdict states that Christie eliminated nearly $7.5 million for family planning services in his first budget for fiscal year 2011. This information confirms that the Republican leadership did indeed reduce funding for Planned Parenthood.", "Closure of family planning clinics": "The third aspect is the closure of six family planning clinics, including two facilities run by affiliates of Planned Parenthood. The expert's verdict mentions that the reduction in funding led to the closure of these clinics, which included locations run by the Burlington County Health Department, Planned Parenthood of Southern New Jersey, FamCare, Inc., the Bayonne Women's Health and Family Planning Center, and Planned Parenthood of Greater Northern New Jersey. This evidence supports Booker's claim of reduced access to women's health services.", "Governor": "s rejection of funding restoration efforts: The fourth aspect is Governor Christie's rejection of efforts by the Democrat-led legislature to restore the funding for family planning services. The expert's verdict states that Christie vetoed a bill in 2010 and eliminated the funding again in 2011, despite the legislature's inclusion of the funding in the budget. This demonstrates a consistent pattern of the governor rejecting attempts to restore the funding, further validating the claim made by Mayor Cory Booker."}
