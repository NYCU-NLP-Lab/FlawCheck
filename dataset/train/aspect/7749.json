{"The claim made by President Obama is that the Trans": "Pacific Partnership (TPP) \"knocks out 18,000 tariffs that other countries place on American products and goods.\"", "The first aspect employed to verify the authenticity of this claim is the analysis of the TPP agreement itself": "Section 2-D of the agreement states that there will be a gradual elimination of tariffs, with each country having a specific schedule for tariff removal. The agreement aims to remove tariffs on various goods over a period of up to 30 years.", "The second aspect involves the calculation of the 18": "000 tariffs by the White House. They determined this number by subtracting countries already subject to a free trade agreement, leaving only Brunei, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, and Vietnam. The World Trade Organization report was used to identify the number of goods subject to tariffs in these countries. The White House concluded that the TPP would remove 98 percent of these tariffs.", "The third aspect is the qualification provided by the White House regarding the calculation of the 18": "000 number. They acknowledged that the figure includes tariffs on American goods that would be removed, as well as tariffs on products that the United States does not currently export but might export in the future. The inclusion of potential future exports was considered consistent with President Obama's statement."}
