{"Comparison of photographs": "The expert compared the viral photograph with a similar CBC News photograph taken at the same event, which showed the correct spelling of \"TRUMP\" on the students' shirts. This comparison helped verify the claim that the supporters misspelled the candidate's name.", "Positioning of students": "The expert noted that the students wearing the \"U\" and \"M\" shirts were standing in the same position in both the viral photograph and the CBC News photograph. This consistency in positioning further supported the authenticity of the correct spelling.", "Time correlation": "The expert mentioned that both photographs were taken at approximately the same time, as indicated by the students' positions relative to the crowd. This time correlation added to the evidence that the misspelled shirts were not genuine.", "Comparison to a previous fake photograph": "The expert highlighted the similarity between the viral photograph and another fake photograph from the 2008 presidential campaign. The previous fake photograph showed a different candidate, Mitt Romney, with children wearing shirts that spelled \"MONEY\" instead of \"ROMNEY.\" This comparison served as a precedent and further cast doubt on the authenticity of the claim."}
