{"The College Board": "s SAT scores: The expert analyzed the SAT mean scores in Georgia in 2010, which were compared to scores from other states. Georgia ranked near the bottom, with only South Carolina and Maine having lower scores.", "Percentage of students taking the SAT": "The expert noted that a larger percentage of Georgia students take the SAT compared to other states. This fact could potentially bring down the mean score, as more students of varying abilities are included in the data.", "Flawed graduation rate data": "The expert mentioned previous investigations into graduation rate data in Georgia, particularly in Clayton County and the city of Atlanta. These investigations revealed problems with undercounting dropouts and mislabeling students as transfers, which could impact the accuracy of the state's graduation rates.", "Lack of demographic and other variables in SAT scores": "The expert highlighted the College Board's warning that SAT scores should not be used for competitive comparisons, as they do not account for factors such as demographics and other variables that can influence test scores. This implies that the SAT scores alone may not provide a comprehensive measure of educational performance in Georgia."}
