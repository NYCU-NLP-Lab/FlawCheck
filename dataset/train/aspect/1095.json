{"The claim is supported by a video recording": "The expert mentions that Rick Green made the claim during a speech in Montgomery County, which was recorded and posted on his campaign website. This video serves as evidence of Green's statement.", "Reference to a publication": "Green's campaign pointed to the 1999 Texas Conservative Report, which is a publication of the Free Enterprise PAC (now known as the Heritage Alliance PAC). This report tracked votes made by legislators and graded them based on their alignment with conservative positions. Green's ranking as the \"fourth-most conservative\" was based on this report.", "Evaluation of voting record": "The panel that compiled the Texas Conservative Report selected 64 votes on various issues to evaluate the legislators. Green and two other House members were found to have voted with the conservative position 88 percent of the time, placing them among the top performers in terms of conservative alignment.", "Criteria for defining conservative positions": "The Texas Conservative Report outlined 28 criteria that were used to identify conservative positions, including factors such as promoting limited government, traditional values, reducing taxes, and protecting citizens' ability to earn a living. Green's alignment with these criteria contributed to his ranking as the \"fourth-most conservative\" in the House."}
