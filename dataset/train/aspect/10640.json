{"The claim incorrectly suggests that there is a national deadline to vote by mail": "when in fact states set their own laws about deadlines for receiving mail ballots.", "The claim creates confusion by stating that voters must send their mail ballots 15 days ahead of time": "but also implying that the post office needs a 14-day roundtrip, suggesting that a voter can mail it in seven days ahead of time.", "The expert": "s verdict highlights that the Postal Service did recommend requesting a mail-in ballot at least 15 days before Election Day and returning it at least seven days before Election Day, but this information is omitted in the claim.", "The expert advises voters to check with their local elections officials for information about when they must return their ballot and their options for how to return it": "as the deadlines and processes vary by state."}
