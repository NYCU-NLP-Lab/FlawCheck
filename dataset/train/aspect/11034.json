{"The expert listened to the interview that Kelli Ward gave and found that she did not call for": "restraint in fighting terrorism\" as claimed in the ad. Instead, she expressed the need to \"decimate ISIS\" and be willing to take strong action against them.", "The expert noted that the partial quote used in the ad": "restraint and realism,\" was taken out of context. It was actually directed at past presidents and their foreign policy approaches, not specifically about fighting terrorists.", "The expert highlighted that the ad used powerful and vilifying visuals of armed masked terrorists": "which may manipulate viewers' emotions and create a false perception of Ward's stance on national defense and fighting terrorists.", "The expert mentioned that polls show Kelli Ward is running second to Rep": "Martha McSally in the primary, indicating that the ad may be a tactic to undermine her campaign rather than a genuine assessment of her positions on military funding and the war on terror."}
