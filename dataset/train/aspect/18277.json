{"Lack of U": "S. government contract: The expert's verdict states that there is no record of any U.S. government contract awarded to James Biden's company, which contradicts the claim that he \"built the cages\" and made millions from it.", "Confirmation from Customs and Border Protections commissioner": "The expert's verdict includes a statement from the commissioner under the Obama administration, who denies any knowledge of a construction deal involving James Biden at a border processing station. This further undermines the claim's authenticity.", "Testimony from former CEO": "According to the expert's verdict, a former CEO of James Biden's parent company confirms that James Biden's firm never received a U.S. government contract. This testimony adds weight to the argument against the claim.", "Lack of evidence from press release and database search": "The expert's verdict highlights that the TikTok post, which is used as evidence for the claim, does not provide any proof of James Biden's involvement in building cages at the U.S.-Mexico border. Additionally, a search of government contracts and prime contractors' lists yielded no results related to James Biden's company, further undermining the claim's credibility."}
