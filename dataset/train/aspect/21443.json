{"President Trump": "s comments: The expert's verdict mentions that in a May 2017 interview, President Trump hypothesized that President Andrew Jackson could have prevented the Civil War.

The plaque claimed that many soldiers died at that spot, turning the water red.", "Historical accuracy": "The expert's verdict highlights the contradiction of the plaque's account by Richard Gillespie, the executive director of the Mosby Heritage Area Association, and Alana Blumenthal, the curator of the Loudoun Museum. Both experts state that the battle described on the plaque never happened at the location.", "Lack of fact": "checking: The expert's verdict mentions that the inscription on the plaque was evidently not fact-checked.
