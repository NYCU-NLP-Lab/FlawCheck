{"Economic estimates by Mark Zandi": "The expert mentions that the claim of the GOP budget plan cutting nearly a million jobs is based on separate economic estimates. Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, provided a report stating that the spending cuts would lead to a loss of 700,000 existing and anticipated jobs by the end of 2012. These estimates consider the reduction in U.S. Gross Domestic Product and the hypothetical jobs that would be created if government spending is not cut.", "Analysis by Scott Lilly": "The expert refers to a column by Dana Milbank in The Washington Post, in which Scott Lilly, a former staff director for the House Appropriations Committee and now a research fellow at the Center for American Progress, estimated that the GOP plan would eliminate 650,000 jobs at government agencies and companies working for the government. Additionally, Lilly suggests that with unemployed workers spending less money, another 325,000 jobs could be lost.", "Impact over time": "Scott Lilly also mentions that the impact of job losses can occur over a period of three to four years, depending on the specific areas where spending cuts are made. For example, cutting highway spending or clean water work may have a longer-term impact, while reducing the number of federal employees at the Social Security Administration would have an immediate impact.", "Comparison with overall job growth": "The expert highlights that the claim of nearly a million jobs being cut is significant because the U.S. has added about 1.3 million total jobs in the past 12 months. By comparing the potential job losses to the overall job growth, the authenticity of the claim can be assessed."}
