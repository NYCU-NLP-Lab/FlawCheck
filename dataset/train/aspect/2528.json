{"The order does not explicitly address transgender women in sports": "leaving room for interpretation and potential challenges in states where bills restricting transgender student participation in athletics are being pushed.", "The executive order": "titled \"Executive Order on Preventing and Combating Discrimination on the Basis of Gender Identity or Sexual Orientation,\" calls on federal agencies to enforce a 2020 U.S. Supreme Court decision that expanded the definition of sex discrimination to include discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.", "The order cites the Bostock v": "Clayton County (2020) Supreme Court case, which held that Title VII's prohibition on discrimination \"because of ... sex\" covers discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation. It mandates that federal agencies enforce this ruling within 100 days of January 20.", "Lawmakers in multiple states": "including Montana, are pushing bills that restrict transgender athletes' participation in sports, potentially putting federal funding for schools in those states at risk. The issue is also being litigated in Connecticut, where girls are challenging a state policy that allows transgender athletes to compete in sports according to their gender identity, arguing that it creates an unfair playing field."}
