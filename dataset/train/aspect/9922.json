{"Lack of specific evidence or explanation": "The expert points out that the original article from Holodilnick fails to provide any specific evidence or explanation for the Bermuda Triangle phenomenon. This lack of concrete information raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Reference to researchers at the University of Southampton": "The Holodilnick article vaguely mentions \"researchers at the University of Southampton in England\" as the source of the scientific explanation for the Bermuda Triangle. However, no further details are provided about the researchers, their study, or their findings. This lack of specific attribution raises concerns about the credibility of the claim.", "Previous study by oceanographers from the University of Southampton": "The expert highlights that the Holodilnick article appears to be an incomplete rehash of news from August 2018. Multiple news outlets had reported on a study conducted by oceanographers from the University of Southampton, which proposed an oceanographic explanation for the Bermuda Triangle phenomenon. This previous study lends some credibility to the claim but raises questions about the novelty of the information presented in the Holodilnick article.", "Rogue waves as an explanation": "The expert mentions that the oceanographers from the University of Southampton concluded that ships in the Bermuda Triangle are being sucked into the ocean by \"rogue waves\" over 30 meters in height. The explanation of rogue waves exceeding the limits of what ships are designed to tolerate provides a specific scientific hypothesis to explain the mysterious disappearances in the Bermuda Triangle. This aspect adds a level of credibility to the claim."}
