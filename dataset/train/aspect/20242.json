{"Envoy Medical": "s statement: Envoy Medical, the manufacturer of the Esteem Hearing Implant mentioned in the claim, explicitly stated that the claims about its device being able to secretly transmit conversations were inaccurate. This statement from the company adds credibility to the fact that the claim is false.", "Biden": "s medical and surgical history: The summary of Joe Biden's medical and surgical history does not mention any skull implant. Instead, it states that his hearing is normal. This information contradicts the claim and further supports its inauthenticity.", "Facebook": "s flagging and partnership: The post making the claim was flagged by Facebook as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation. This indicates that the social media platform recognized the claim as false and took action to address it. Additionally, the mention of a partnership between the fact-checking organization and Facebook adds to the credibility of the debunking.", "Lack of evidence and false claims": "The post itself fails to provide any credible evidence or sources to support the claim. It is described as a 1,000-word post packed with false claims aimed at portraying Biden as mentally unfit. The lack of substantiated evidence and the presence of multiple false claims further undermine the authenticity of the original claim."}
