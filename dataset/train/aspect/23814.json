{"The claim was supported by a statistic cited by the politician": "stating that \"80% of the country is living paycheck to paycheck.\" This statistic was presented as evidence of the financial pressure faced by a majority of the population.", "A survey conducted by CareerBuilder and the Harris Poll was mentioned": "which provided a breakdown of the numbers related to living paycheck to paycheck. The survey revealed that 38% of employees sometimes live paycheck to paycheck, 17% usually do, and 23% always do. This data suggests that the percentage of people living paycheck to paycheck may not be as high as initially claimed.", "An expert from the Urban Institute": "Kreg Steven Brown, criticized the inclusion of those who only reported \"sometimes\" living paycheck to paycheck in the total percentage. He argued that it was imprecise to include them and that it could skew the overall picture.", "Other public opinion surveys were mentioned": "including a 2014 poll by Harris, which found that 46% of unretired U.S. adults reported living paycheck to paycheck and being unable to save money. Additionally, a 2017 survey analyzed by the Urban Institute found that 32% of non-elderly U.S. adults had experienced some form of financial distress in the previous year. These surveys provide alternative perspectives on the financial situation of Americans and suggest that the 80% claim may be overstated."}
