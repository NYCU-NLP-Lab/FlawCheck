{"Lack of evidence": "The expert's verdict states that the claim of the victims being tied to an investigation into the Clinton Foundation is spread without any evidence. Investigators found no evidence of foul play and ruled the deaths as accidental.", "Source credibility": "The story originated from whatdoesitmean.com, a website known for spreading false news. The expert points out that the website is a purveyor of false news and highlights that the story has appeared on other websites as well.", "Unreliable sources": "The claim relies on citing a \"Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) report circulating in the Kremlin\" and a quote from an unidentified user in a public forum website. These sources lack credibility and do not provide verifiable evidence.", "Omission of relevant information": "The conspiracy theory fails to mention that Hillary Clinton publicly rebuked the pharmaceutical company mentioned in the claim for its price gouging practices. This omission suggests a biased narrative and undermines the credibility of the claim."}
