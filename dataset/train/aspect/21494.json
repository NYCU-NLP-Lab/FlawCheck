{"The release of FBI messages": "The expert mentions that Rep. Matt Gaetz based his claim on a tranche of FBI messages released by Sen. Ron Johnson. This aspect verifies the authenticity of the claim as it provides evidence of the communication between FBI lawyer Lisa Page and agent Peter Strzok.", "Text message content": "The expert highlights that the text message in question, sent on Sept. 1, 2016, mentioned that Obama wanted \"to know everything we\u2019re doing.\" This aspect supports Gaetz's claim that the message referred to the FBI's investigation of Clinton's private email server.", "Wall Street Journal report": "The expert mentions that the Wall Street Journal reported that associates of Strzok and Page stated that the texts were about Russia's meddling in the 2016 presidential election. This aspect contradicts Gaetz's claim and undermines the authenticity of the claim.", "Lack of indication from the FBI": "The expert states that there was no indication that the FBI was actively investigating Clinton's emails on Sept. 2, 2016, as Gaetz claimed. This aspect further weakens the authenticity of the claim."}
