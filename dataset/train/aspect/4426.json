{"The claim made by State Sen": "Sylvia Garcia, D-Houston, that it is already illegal to enter a bathroom to harm someone in Texas.", "The existence of a legislative proposal called the Texas Privacy Act": "authored by Sen. Lois Kolkhorst, R-Brenham, which primarily aims to require transgender people to use bathrooms corresponding with their assigned sex at birth.", "The opposition of Democrats to the Texas Privacy Act": "arguing that it is discriminatory against transgender people and could harm Texas businesses and tourism.", "The response from a Kolkhorst spokesman": "Matthew Russell, stating that it is incorrect to claim that Texas law already forbids entering a restroom for the purpose of committing a crime, but Kolkhorst's legislation recognizes that predators often target victims in vulnerable locations such as showers, locker rooms, and restrooms."}
