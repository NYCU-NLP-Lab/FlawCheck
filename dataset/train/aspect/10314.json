{"Comparison with County records": "One aspect employed to verify the authenticity of the claim is comparing the claim with the records of the Milwaukee County Sheriff's Department's budget requests over the years. This would involve examining the actual budget proposals submitted by the Sheriff's Department and determining if they align with the claim of never asking for more than inflationary budget increases.", "Analysis of budget allocations": "Another aspect would be analyzing the budget allocations provided to the Milwaukee County Sheriff's Department each year. By examining the actual budget amounts approved by the County Board, it can be determined if the department consistently received only inflationary increases or if there were instances of additional resources being requested and granted.", "Evaluation of financial constraints": "It would also be important to evaluate the financial constraints faced by the Milwaukee County and the Sheriff's Department during the relevant period. This would involve considering the overall financial condition of the county and any budgetary limitations that may have influenced the Sheriff's Department's requests and allocations.", "Assessment of statements and past actions": "Lastly, an assessment of statements made by the Milwaukee County Sheriff, David A. Clarke Jr., and his past actions would be necessary. This would involve scrutinizing any previous statements or public records where Clarke may have discussed or requested additional resources beyond inflationary budget increases. Additionally, examining any efforts made by Clarke to streamline the department and control expenses, such as reducing overtime payments, would provide further insight into the claim's authenticity."}
