{"Joe Biden explicitly stated during the first 2020 presidential debate that he does not support the Green New Deal and instead supports his own climate change plan called the": "Biden Plan.\"", "The Biden Plan": "while sharing some similarities with the Green New Deal, also differs from it in significant ways.
