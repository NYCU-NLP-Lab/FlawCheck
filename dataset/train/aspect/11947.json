{"The claim was investigated by conducting a Google reverse": "image search of one of the keyframes of the video, which revealed that the photograph was from NH-80 in Bhagalpur's Pirpainti, not Rahul Gandhi's constituency Wayanad.", "ABP News had visited the highway in Bhagalpur to inspect the road and found that it had been repaired": "This confirmed that the viral image was from two months before and not a current representation of the road in Wayanad.", "A local social worker from the Bhagalpur area": "Dilip Mishra, confirmed that the road was in poor condition in May 2017 and that repair work was completed by July. This further supported the fact that the image was not from Wayanad.", "The Times of India had published a report in June 2017 that carried the same image of the pothole": "filled road in Bhagalpur, Bihar. This provided additional evidence that the image was not related to Rahul Gandhi's constituency."}
