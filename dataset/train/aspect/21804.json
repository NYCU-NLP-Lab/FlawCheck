{"The photo in question was posted on the Facebook page": "Florida Firefighters for TRUMP\" on May 9, 2016, showing Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn walking down the sidewalk, holding hands and wearing shirts with American flags and \"Trump 2016.\"", "An image search revealed that the photo had been doctored": "as the original image of Russell and Hawn showed them wearing the same outfits but without American flags or references to Trump or ISIS on their white shirts.", "The caption with the photo mentioned": "Stephen (The Bull) McCaffrey,\" a reference to the 1991 film \"Backdraft\" in which Russell plays a Chicago firefighter. This suggests that the photo was likely taken of the couple years ago while they were out in Los Angeles, as confirmed by a PopSugar article from September 2015.", "The Facebook page that originally posted the photo did not respond to a request for evidence supporting their claim that Kurt Russell supports Trump": ""}
