{"The graphic claiming that PM Modi was credited for the death of Abu Bakr Al Baghdadi was found to be a work of photoshop": "A comparison of several past graphics of the show 'Aar Par' with the circulating graphic showed a mismatch in the font, indicating its inauthenticity.", "The raid to take down Baghdadi was carried out over the weekend": "and no episode of the show 'Aar Par' was aired during this time. The latest show aired on October 28 was on an unrelated topic. This information disproves the claim made in the graphic.", "Journalist Amish Devgan": "the anchor of the show 'Aar Par', quote-tweeted a tweet sharing the graphic and called out the misinformation, stating that the image was fake. His response further verified the inauthenticity of the claim.", "The misinformation was earlier debunked by Boomlive": "a fact-checking website, which provided evidence and analysis to prove that the graphic was manipulated and false. This external verification adds to the authenticity of the expert's verdict."}
