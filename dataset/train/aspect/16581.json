{"Rep": "Greg Murphy, the primary sponsor of the STOP Act, made the claim that \"Every day, four North Carolinians die from a medication or drug overdose.\"", "The claim made by Rep": "Murphy has been repeatedly quoted or paraphrased in the news, indicating its widespread dissemination.", "The North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services reported that in 2015": "there were 1,370 deaths due to unintentional poisonings, with 93% (1,274) of those being drug overdoses, supporting Rep. Murphy's claim.", "While Rep": "Murphy's claim specifically refers to all drug overdoses, the STOP Act focuses solely on limiting the supply of prescription painkillers, indicating a narrower scope for the proposed legislation."}
