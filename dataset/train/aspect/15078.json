This highlights the lack of credible evidence to support the claim of a photograph showing a dead woman collecting souls.", "Chain letter history": "The expert mentions that the claim is a common type of chain letter, which has been around since at least the 19th century. This historical context suggests that the claim is not unique or authentic, but rather a form of a viral hoax.", "Inconsistencies in accompanying stories": "The expert highlights various backstories accompanying the image of the woman, including incidents of people being killed after not sharing the photo. However, these stories lack verifiable details and are likely fabricated, indicating a lack of authenticity in the claim.", "Lack of substantial substance": "The expert concludes that despite the use of email and social networking platforms to spread the claim, the substance of the claim remains the same as century-old chain letters. This suggests that the claim lacks substantial evidence or credibility, further questioning its authenticity."}
