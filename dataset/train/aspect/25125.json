Leonard Lance being rated as one of the most bipartisan members of Congress.", "The rankings used to support the claim consider the entirety of the previous Congress": "factoring in 2015 and 2016, and for all of 2017, Lance ranked 75th and 13th most bipartisan in the House of Representatives, respectively.", "The rankings do not include ceremonial bills or legislation to name a post office": "and they are statistically weighted and standardized to account for political party affiliation, ensuring fairness in the assessment of bipartisanship."}
