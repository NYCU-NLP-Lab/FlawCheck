{"The claim was supported by a statement made by Tammy Baldwin on the Devil": "s Advocate show on Madison radio, where she stated that the younger generation, on average, starts their careers with just under $30,000 in debt if they have attended a four-year college.", "The claim was backed by a report from the Institute for College Access": "Success, an independent, nonprofit group that tracks student loan debt by state. The report stated that the average debt nationally for 2012 graduates who took out loans was $29,400, with Wisconsin graduates having an average debt of $28,102.", "The report acknowledged that its data was incomplete as only about half of all public and private nonprofit four": "year colleges reported their student loan debt figures for 2012. This suggests that the actual average debt may vary from the reported figures.", "The report did not differentiate between federal or private loans": "and it did not include data from for-profit colleges. Private loans make up one fifth of overall student loan debt, and for-profit colleges have the highest average debt per borrower. This indicates that the $30,000 figure may not represent the full extent of student loan debt for all college graduates."}
