{"The expert compared the current restrictions in Missouri to the historical response to the 1918 flu pandemic": "highlighting the similarities in terms of public gathering cancellations and closure of non-essential businesses.", "The expert investigated the claim made by Missouri state Sen": "Cindy O\u2019Laughlin, who stated that there has been no time in the history of the country when healthy people have been confined to their homes or only able to do essential things in Kansas City or St. Louis. The expert found evidence of stay-at-home orders in both cities and compared them to historical examples of similar restrictions during the 1918 flu pandemic.", "The expert reached out to O": "Laughlin for context and found that she referred to the stay-at-home orders as \"expanded quarantines\" and believed they infringed on residents' rights. The expert contrasted this with the CDC's definition of quarantines as restrictions on movements of sick people.", "The expert examined the current statewide stay": "at-home order in Missouri, which encourages residents to avoid leaving their homes or places of residence, with exceptions for essential activities such as grocery shopping and getting fresh air. This order was compared to the historical restrictions imposed during the 1918 flu pandemic, where public gatherings were canceled, schools and churches were closed, and only essential businesses were allowed to operate."}
