{"The claim is based on a news story from the Texas Tribune": "which reported that many high schools in Texas have failed to help students register to vote and that voter turnout among young voters is chronically low. The story referenced U.S. Census Bureau research on voter registration and turnout in 2016.", "The claim is supported by a report from the Texas Civil Rights Project and the Lawyers": "Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, which found that only 14 percent of Texas public high schools requested voter registration applications from the Texas secretary of state's office in 2016, despite a state law requiring them to do so.", "The claim is consistent with a Texas law that mandates high school administrators to distribute voter registration applications to eligible students at least twice a year": "While schools are not required to collect filled-out forms, completed forms that are turned in must be forwarded to expedite the registration process.", "National post": "election surveys conducted by the Census Bureau indicate that voter registration rates among young voters in Texas have declined every four years from 2000 to 2012, but showed improvement in 2016. This suggests that the claim about low voter registration rates among Texans aged 18-24 is consistent with larger trends in the state."}
