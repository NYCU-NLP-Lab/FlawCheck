{"The images shared by the official RSS Facebook page were found to be from the 2012 floods in Kerala": "not from the recent Kerala floods. This inconsistency in the timeline of the images raised doubts about their authenticity.", "The presence of a reporter in one of the images": "who had shared the same image in 2012, indicated that the image was not recent and was being misrepresented to claim RSS workers' aid during the Kerala floods.", "The image was also widely circulated on social media platforms like Twitter": "including by accounts associated with the RSS, further raising questions about the authenticity of the claim.", "Other images that were shared as evidence of RSS workers": "aid during the Kerala floods were found to be from Gujarat in the previous year, not from Kerala. This discrepancy in the location of the images added to the doubts surrounding the claim."}
