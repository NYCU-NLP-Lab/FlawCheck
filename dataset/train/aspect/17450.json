{"DeKalb County": "s claim of being \"the greenest county in America\" is supported by statements from its communications director, Burke Brennan, and its Chief Executive Officer, Burrell Ellis, who stated that the county is taking the lead on sustainability and is one step closer to achieving this title.", "The claim is met with skepticism by some individuals": "including Mark Woodall, the Georgia chapter chairman of the Sierra Club, who believes that DeKalb being the greenest county in America is unlikely and that it may be more reasonable to consider it as one of the greenest counties in Georgia.", "The lack of comparable rankings or surveys specifically focusing on the greenest counties in America makes it difficult to objectively evaluate DeKalb County": "s claim. While some organizations have released rankings of the greenest cities, there are few similar rankings available for counties.", "In terms of physical health": "DeKalb County ranked near the bottom among Georgia counties according to a study conducted by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. This study considered factors such as air quality, access to healthy food, and the presence of liquor stores in each county. This finding raises questions about DeKalb County's overall environmental health and its claim of being the greenest county in America."}
