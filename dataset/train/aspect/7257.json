{"Maria Shriver made the claim that": "Two-thirds of American families rely on the mother's income to stay above the poverty level\" on Meet the Press.", "The claim was accompanied by a graphic highlighting the same message": "3. Philip Cohen, a researcher at the University of Maryland, analyzed Census Bureau data and found that approximately 20% of families with mothers and children rely on the mother's income to remain above the poverty line.", "Cohen also found that if only considering families that were not in poverty": "the percentage of families relying on a mother's income to stay out of poverty would be around 24%, far from the claimed two-thirds."}
