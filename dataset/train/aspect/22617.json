{"Lack of evidence provided": "The congressman's office was unable to provide any studies that refute the link between ground-level ozone and asthma, despite claiming that there are \"thousands of studies\" contradicting the EPA's conclusion.", "Well": "documented scientific literature: The relationship between ground-level ozone and asthma exacerbation is well-documented in the scientific literature, as noted by experts. This indicates that there is substantial evidence supporting the EPA's conclusion.", "Confirmation by reputable organizations": "The American Lung Association and the World Health Organization both state that ozone pollution is a health threat to asthmatics. Their endorsement of the link between ground-level ozone and asthma adds credibility to the EPA's conclusion.", "Consideration of other factors": "The EPA's scientific analysis took into consideration studies that looked at other factors linked to asthma, such as indoor air pollution. This suggests that the EPA's evaluation was comprehensive and not solely focused on ground-level ozone."}
