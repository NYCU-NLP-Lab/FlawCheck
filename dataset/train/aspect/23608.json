{"Lack of evidence": "The expert notes that there is no record or evidence of Valerie Jarrett ever making the quoted statement about being \"Iranian by birth\" and wanting to \"change America to be a more Islamic country.\" No media organization has reported on this quote in the last 40 years.", "Inconsistencies in the quote": "The expert points out that the quote itself is suspicious, as it includes the name \"Valerie Jarrett\" even though she did not go by that name in 1977. At the time, she used her maiden name, Bowman. This raises doubts about the authenticity of the quote.", "Valerie Jarrett": "s background: The expert explains that Valerie Jarrett was indeed born in Iran, but to American parents. Her father worked as a physician in Iran, and the family lived there for about six years. However, they eventually moved back to the United States, and Jarrett has no known affiliation with Islam.", "Confirmation from Stanford University": "The expert mentions that Stanford University, where the quote claims to have been made, has confirmed that the quote is fabricated. The university reviewed the relevant yearbooks and found no evidence of any student quotes attributed to Valerie Jarrett or Valerie Bowman. This further discredits the claim's authenticity."}
