{"The expert conducted a reverse image search of the video frames and found a fact check report by news agency AFP dated June 13": "2020, which indicated that the video was earlier viral as a \"demonstration against Argentina's president, Alberto Fernandez.\" This suggests that the video could not possibly depict Maradona's funeral.", "The expert referred to a local newspaper article from La Nacion": "published on October 20, 2019, which reported that a crowd had gathered near the Obelisk memorial in Buenos Aires for an election rally in support of then-president Mauricio Macri. This indicates that the clip shows a group of people attending a political event, not Maradona's funeral.", "The expert compared a specific frame from the viral clip with a tweet by Mauricio Macri": "which contained a picture of an aerial view of the rally. This comparison further supports the conclusion that the video does not depict Maradona's funeral but rather an election rally.", "The expert analyzed the content of the claim itself": "noting that it was shared by Twitter user @Exsecular and Facebook page Vega Entertainment, both of which are not directly associated with Maradona's funeral or reliable sources of information. This raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim."}
