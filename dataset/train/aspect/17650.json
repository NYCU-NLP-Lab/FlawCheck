{"The claim is based on a distorted interpretation of an actual scientific study about green algae": "specifically Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, which demonstrated that under specific conditions, the algae can derive energy by breaking down and consuming cellulose from other plants.", "The claim misrepresents the findings of the study by suggesting that humans can draw energy from each other in a similar way": "which is not supported by any scientific evidence.", "The claim is propagated through a viral article published on Simple Capacity": "a website known for promoting alternative health and science content, and subsequently shared on various meditation and alternative health social media pages.", "The claim is supported by the comment of a supposed": "psychologist and energy healer\" named Dr. Olivia Bader-Lee, who may be a fictional character created to promote this specific claim. Dr. Bader-Lee's comment further promotes the idea that humans can absorb energy from others, but there is no scientific basis for this assertion."}
