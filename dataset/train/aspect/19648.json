{"The expert": "s verdict highlights that the claim made by Sen. Rand Paul is misleading and suggests that immunity from naturally acquired COVID-19 is better than that from a vaccine. However, it is emphasized that the comparison between immunity from the two sources is not known, and the purpose of a vaccine is to provide immunity without the risk of getting sick.", "Sen": "Rand Paul presented interim efficacy figures from two ongoing vaccine clinical trials and calculated the \"effectiveness\" of natural infection with the coronavirus. The claim implies that naturally acquired COVID-19 is 99.9982% effective, which is significantly higher than the reported efficacy figures of the vaccines.", "The expert points out that Sen": "Rand Paul has previously spread misinformation about childhood vaccines and has inaccurately argued during the COVID-19 pandemic that parts of the U.S. have reached herd immunity due to preexisting immunity to other coronaviruses. This highlights a pattern of spreading misleading information regarding vaccines and immunity.", "The expert also mentions that the juxtaposition of the numbers provided by Sen": "Rand Paul implies a superiority of natural infection over vaccination, which is a dangerous notion. It is emphasized that contracting the virus poses a serious risk, and vaccines are a safe way to achieve immunity. The expert argues that even a fraction of the risk associated with getting sick with COVID-19 would not be tolerated in a vaccine."}
