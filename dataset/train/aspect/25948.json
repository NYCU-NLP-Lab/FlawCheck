{"The specific claim being made is that the first piece of legislation passed by Republicans in 2017 made it easier for the mentally ill to purchase guns": "2. The expert's verdict confirms that the claim accurately describes a Republican-sponsored law, but clarifies that it wasn't the first to pass that year. The law in question, House Joint Resolution 40, actually undid a Social Security Administration rule requiring the agency to report certain disabled applicants to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System.", "The expert also mentions that federal law already prohibits individuals who have been adjudicated as a mental defective or committed to a mental institution from owning a gun": "In 2008, the NICS Improvement Amendment Act mandated federal agencies to report certain disabled individuals to the background check system.", "The expert highlights that the SSA rule": "which was issued in 2016 to comply with the NICS Improvement Amendment Act, aimed to affect approximately 75,000 people each year who have a documented mental health issue and receive disability benefits but are unable to manage those benefits due to their mental impairment. The rule also provided a mechanism for individuals to seek an exemption from the ban on owning a gun for mental health reasons. However, in 2017, Republicans, supported by the National Rifle Association and disability rights groups, initiated a process to void the SSA rule, arguing that it stigmatized people with disabilities and infringed on their constitutional right to bear arms."}
