This suggests that there is a lack of concrete proof to support the claim.", "Tabloid news sources": "The expert's verdict highlights that the claim originated from tabloid news sites such as the Toronto Sun, the New York Post, the U.S. Sun, and Vietnam Insider. Tabloid news sources are often known for sensationalism and may not always provide accurate information.", "Animal rights group investigation": "The expert's verdict mentions an investigation conducted by an animal rights group called Four Paws. The investigation examined dining app data and found a surge in dog and cat meat sales in Cambodia and Vietnam. However, the expert's verdict does not indicate any direct evidence linking this surge to the consumption of black cats as a COVID-19 cure.", "Unverified images and captions": "The expert's verdict mentions the inclusion of pictures credited to the South West News Service in some versions of the online stories.
