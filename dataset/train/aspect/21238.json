{"U": "S. Homeland Security Secretary's statement: The expert's verdict references U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano's remarks, where she stated that people overstaying their visas may account for fewer than 40 percent of illegal immigrants. This statement provides additional information and perspective on the issue.", "Contrasting estimates": "The expert's verdict highlights that estimating the number of visa overstayers and their contribution to the overall illegal immigrant population is challenging. The verdict mentions that available estimates suggest Andrews may be overstating the number of illegal immigrants who first arrived legally and stayed past the valid time limits.", "Comparison between visa overstayers and border crossers": "The expert's verdict addresses the defense of Andrews' statement by his chief of staff, Fran Tagmire. It clarifies that Andrews' statement did not directly compare visa overstayers and those who illegally crossed the Mexican border. Instead, the statement claimed that overstayers are the \"number-one source\" of all illegal immigrants. This distinction helps to understand the context of the claim."}
