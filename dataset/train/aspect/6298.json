{"Elections Canada": "s statement: Elections Canada, the independent federal agency responsible for conducting elections in Canada, tweeted that they do not use Dominion Voting Systems and have never used voting machines or electronic tabulators in their 100-year history. This statement verifies that the claim of Trudeau using Dominion system for the 2019 federal election is not true.", "Dominion machines in Canadian elections": "The expert mentions that although Dominion ballot counting machines have never been used in a Canadian federal election, they have been utilized for local and provincial elections. This information confirms that Dominion machines have been used in some Canadian elections, but not at the federal level.", "Metadata from the photo": "The expert points out that the photo shared in the Facebook posts was taken during the 2013 Liberal Party leadership race and was published on Trudeau's Flickr account. The metadata on the Flickr page indicates that the picture was taken on April 9, 2013, which verifies that the photo is from a different event and not related to the 2019 federal election.", "Lack of Liberal Party leadership race in 2019": "The expert states that there was no Liberal Party leadership race in 2019 and Trudeau retained the prime ministership after the October federal election. This fact confirms that Trudeau did not participate in a leadership race in 2019, further discrediting the claim."}
