{"Lack of arrests and ongoing investigation": "The expert's verdict highlights that police have made no arrests in connection with the vandalism of the Frederick Douglass statue in Rochester, New York. The ongoing investigation suggests that the authenticity of the claim cannot be verified at this time.", "Protests and debates over monuments": "The expert's verdict mentions that cities across the U.S. have experienced protests and debates regarding the removal of monuments to Confederate generals and other historical figures. This context suggests that the vandalism of statues has been a part of these protests, but it does not specifically verify the claim about Democrats destroying the Frederick Douglass statue.", "Unsupported claim by Donald Trump Jr": "The expert's verdict states that Donald Trump Jr. shared a viral meme making the unsupported claim that Democrats vandalized the Douglass statue. This indicates that the claim lacks credible evidence and is based on a social media post.", "Lack of evidence and unknown perpetrators": "The expert's verdict emphasizes that there is no basis to support the claims about Democrats, anarchists, or rioters tearing down the Douglass statue. The police department is still investigating the vandalism and has not identified any suspects or confirmed the motive behind the act. This lack of evidence further questions the authenticity of the claim."}
