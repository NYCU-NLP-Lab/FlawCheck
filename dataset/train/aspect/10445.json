{"Lack of evidence": "The expert found no evidence to support the claim that Donald Trump made incendiary remarks about Africans in Indianapolis in October 2015. Reverse image searches showed that the purported article had been circulating online for several years, but there was no concrete evidence to verify its authenticity.", "Inconsistencies in campaign schedule": "The expert investigated Trump's campaign schedule for October 2015 and found no evidence of him speaking in Indianapolis during that time. His campaign stops included Norcross, Georgia; Anderson, South Carolina; and Norfolk, Virginia. This inconsistency raises doubts about the claim's validity.", "Absence of public statements": "While Trump had promoted the debunked conspiracy theory about Barack Obama's birthplace in the past, there were no public statements found in which he called for Obama to be \"deported.\" This contradicts the claim made in the purported article.", "Previous debunking by Snopes": "The expert discovered that a similar story had been debunked by Snopes after it appeared on a website called \"Politica\" in October 2015. This suggests that the claim has been circulating for a while and has already been discredited by reputable fact-checking sources."}
