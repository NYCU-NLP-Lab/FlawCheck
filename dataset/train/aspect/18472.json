{"Poor grammatical style and absence of credible reporting": "The expert points out that the article containing the claim had a poor grammatical style and lacked credibility as it was published on a fake news website, TMZBreaking, which is known for fabricating stories. This aspect undermines the authenticity of the claim.", "Lack of corroborating reports in legitimate news outlets": "The expert mentions that there were no credible news outlets reporting the incident of a passenger plane making an emergency landing due to offensive vaginal odor. This absence of corroborating reports raises doubts about the veracity of the claim.", "Inconsistent and unrelated images": "The expert highlights that the image accompanying the fictional story was a stock photograph of an airplane interior from 2008, while the picture of \"Larissa Jones\" was an unrelated mugshot taken in 2013 or earlier. This inconsistency in images suggests that they were not directly related to the claimed incident, further questioning the authenticity of the claim.", "Previous fabrications by the fake news outlets": "The expert mentions that the cluster of fake TMZ sites, including TMZBreaking, has a history of fabricating stories. They provide examples of previous fabrications, such as false claims about a cop shooting a black baby and a college student being in a coma due to a social media challenge. This pattern of fabrications casts doubt on the credibility of the claim in question."}
