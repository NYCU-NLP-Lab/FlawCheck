{"Lack of evidence of collaboration": "The expert's investigation involved searching court records, press releases, statements from both organizations, and news coverage of the Missouri campaigns. Despite extensive research, no evidence of collaboration between Planned Parenthood and the Satanic Temple was found.", "Denial from the Satanic Temple": "The Satanic Temple explicitly denied any collaboration or shared resources with Planned Parenthood. They stated that while their efforts may be simultaneous due to a shared interest in fighting against reproductive rights restrictions, there is no collaboration or competition between the two organizations.", "Confirmation from Planned Parenthood": "Planned Parenthood also confirmed that they had not collaborated or shared resources with the Satanic Temple in any way.", "Lawsuits pursued separately": "Both Planned Parenthood and the Satanic Temple had taken separate court cases in Missouri, but their objectives were to lower or remove restrictions on abortion rights. The claim that they had \"teamed up\" or \"worked in tandem\" to oppose the laws restricting abortion rights in Missouri was deemed false."}
