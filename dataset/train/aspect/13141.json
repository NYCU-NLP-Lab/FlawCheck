{"Confirmation from Southwest Airlines spokesman": "The expert's verdict mentions that a Southwest Airlines spokesman, Dan Landson, confirmed that the claim is a scam. This confirmation from an official representative of the airline adds credibility to the assessment of the claim's authenticity.", "Discrepancies in the website and date format": "The expert highlights that the phony website promoting the claim has a different domain name (sout-west.com) compared to the official Southwest Airlines website (Southwest.com). Additionally, the date format used in the claim (\"27. November 2017\") is not consistent with the format typically used by Southwest Airlines. These inconsistencies raise doubts about the claim's authenticity.", "Lack of precedent for such offers": "The expert mentions that Southwest Airlines does not have a history of giving out free tickets, and their official spokesperson confirms this. The claim of celebrating the airline's 50th anniversary by providing two free tickets to everyone goes against the airline's standard practices, further questioning its authenticity.", "Previous scams and expert analysis": "The expert refers to a similar scam reported in the Miami Herald in 2011 and an analysis by security analyst Graham Cluley in 2016. These references provide evidence that scams like this have been circulating for several years, indicating a pattern of fraudulent activity. This history of scams adds weight to the assessment that the claim is not authentic."}
