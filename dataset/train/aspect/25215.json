{"Lack of official organization": "The expert points out that there is no organization called the \"Supreme Islamic Council of Victoria\" mentioned in the claim. This raises doubts about the authenticity of the sign.", "Inconsistent terminology": "The expert notes that the city of Melbourne does not typically refer to itself as \"the City of Greater Melbourne.\" This discrepancy in terminology suggests that the sign may not be an official communication from the city.", "Absence of municipal logos": "The expert mentions that there are no visible municipal logos on the sign. This further weakens the claim's authenticity as official signs usually bear the logos or emblems of the governing body.", "Official disavowal by the city": "The expert highlights the response from the official City of Melbourne Twitter account, which disavowed the sign and stated that it was not endorsed by them. This official statement adds credibility to the notion that the sign is not genuine."}
