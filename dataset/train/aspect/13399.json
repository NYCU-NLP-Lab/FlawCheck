{"Social media claims and captions": "The expert analyzed the claims and captions accompanying the video on social media platforms, which indicated that the incident was said to have occurred in Mumbai's Dongri area and Gujarat's Veraval market. These claims were taken into consideration during the verification process.", "Comparison with movie set footage": "A user on Twitter suggested that the video was actually from a movie set and provided another clip showing the same individuals present in the viral video. The expert compared the two videos and observed similarities, such as the lack of panic, the presence of cameras and equipment, and the person who was shot getting up. This comparison supported the hypothesis that the video was from a movie shooting.", "Language analysis": "The expert noted that people in the video posted by the Twitter user @khan25_shoaib were speaking in Gujarati. Based on this observation, a search was conducted, leading to a Facebook post from the 'Our gir Somnath' page, which stated that the viral video was fake and no such incident occurred in Veraval market. Language analysis helped in debunking the claim.", "Corroborating evidence from other sources": "The expert found that a news outlet, Goa News Hub, had previously uploaded the same video, stating that it was a film shooting in Mapusa and not a real-life incident. This additional source provided further evidence to support the conclusion that the video was not authentic."}
