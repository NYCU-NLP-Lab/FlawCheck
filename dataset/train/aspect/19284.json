{"The claim that Nancy Green": "the face of Aunt Jemima, died a millionaire is refuted by historical evidence and expert testimonies. Sherry Williams, president of the Bronzeville Historical Society in Chicago, states that there is no mention of Green's wealth in any articles or newspaper accounts. Maurice Manring, an independent historian and author, also confirms that there is no contemporaneous evidence suggesting Green was rich or ostentatiously wealthy.", "The origin of the Aunt Jemima pancake mix is attributed to Chris Rutt and Charles Underwood": "who developed the product in 1889. The company's website confirms that R.T. Davis acquired the company from Rutt and Underwood, contradicting the claim that Nancy Green invented the pancake mix.", "The claim that Green sold her pancake recipe to the milling company is disputed": "While one obituary suggests Green sold the recipe, others state that it was her popular dish that made her a perfect spokeswoman for the new ready mix. The exact details of the transaction remain unclear.", "The association between the Aunt Jemima brand and the song": "Old Aunt Jemima\" is addressed. It is stated that Chris Rutt adopted the name for his brand after seeing a performance of the song at a minstrel show, due to its popularity. This further dispels the notion that Nancy Green was directly responsible for the creation of the brand."}
