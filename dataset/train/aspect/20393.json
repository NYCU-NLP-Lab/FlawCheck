{"The expert noted that Kirk Douglas passed away at the age of 103 on February 5": "2020, which contradicts the claim that he died four days before his 101st birthday in December 2017. This information was verified through official records and news reports.", "The expert mentioned that the web site Action News 3 published an article claiming Kirk Douglas had passed away": "However, the expert found no mention of this alleged death in any credible publication, indicating a lack of evidence to support the claim.", "The expert highlighted that no obituaries": "statements, or tributes to Kirk Douglas were published in the two days following the publication of the death hoax. Considering Douglas's significant achievements and fame, the absence of such public acknowledgments further cast doubt on the authenticity of the claim.", "The expert provided additional information about the disreputable nature of Action News 3": "the website that initially reported Kirk Douglas's death. The website has a history of peddling misinformation and promoting death hoaxes, including falsely reporting the deaths of other notable individuals like Morgan Freeman, Bob Barker, and George Zimmerman. This context raises skepticism about the credibility of the source behind the claim."}
