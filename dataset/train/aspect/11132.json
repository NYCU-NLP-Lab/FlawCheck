{"Historical water level data": "Scientists have analyzed historical water level data of Lake Michigan and found that over the past 150 years, water levels have varied within a relatively narrow, 2-meter range. This provides a baseline for understanding the fluctuations in water levels.", "Comparison to previous records": "The expert's verdict mentions that water levels in Lake Michigan were lower in January 2013 than at any time since records began in 1918. This comparison to previous records helps verify the claim about recent record-low water levels.", "Factors affecting water levels": "The expert's verdict highlights several factors that can affect water levels, such as dredging, erosion, and diversion. While these factors have contributed to reducing the baseline level of Lake Michigan, they have not directly contributed to recent fluctuations in water levels.", "Climate change and precipitation": "The expert's verdict suggests that low precipitation, specifically in 2011 and 2012, may have played a role in the recent fluctuations of water levels in Lake Michigan. Mild winters and reduced snowpacks during those years resulted in lower-than-normal incoming water, potentially influenced by climate change. This aspect connects the claim to the broader context of global warming and its impact on precipitation patterns."}
