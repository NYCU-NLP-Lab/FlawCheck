{"Lack of evidence": "There is no evidence to support the claim that the attacker in the video is a Muslim migrant. The caption accompanying the video is misleading and came from the comment section, not any verifiable source.", "Original video focus": "The original posting of the video on Dumpert.nl in May 2017 did not mention the attacker's religion. It primarily focused on the act of hitting a person on crutches. The assumption that the attacker was a Muslim migrant was baseless and arose from the comment section.", "Arrest and identification": "Dutch police officers were able to locate and arrest the attacker shortly after the video was posted. A news report identified him as a 16-year-old boy from Monnickendam, but made no mention of his religion. This further refutes the claim of the attacker being a Muslim migrant.", "Official statements": "The Public Prosecution Service of North Holland, as well as the web site Dumpert.nl and Geenstijl, disputed the claim that the attacker was a Muslim migrant. They all confirmed that the perpetrator was not a Muslim and not an immigrant, but simply a Dutchman. These official statements provide further verification of the inauthenticity of the claim."}
