{"Clinton cited analyses by Moody": "s Analytics to support her claim that her plans would be better for jobs. However, she puts some spin on those reports, stretching the facts on a few points.", "Moody": "s Analytics also stated that it doesn't expect Clinton would likely be able to pass all of her proposals through a divided Congress, and Congress would put up substantial roadblocks to her policy proposals. Under its most-likely scenario, a Clinton presidency would result in employment going just a bit higher than it otherwise would, creating 1.5 million more jobs over 10 years than expected under current law.", "Clinton accurately described the dire economic projection Moody": "s forecast if Trump were able to implement all of his proposed policies at face value. Moody's predicts the economy would suffer an extended recession and result in 3.4 million job losses over the course of Trump's presidency."}
