{"Comparison of job losses": "The expert compared the number of job losses during the last three months under President Bush and the past three months under President Obama. This involved analyzing the specific figures for each period.", "Averaging job losses": "To determine a more accurate comparison, the expert calculated the average job losses for both presidents over their respective three-month periods. This allowed for a more comprehensive assessment of the overall trend.", "Difference in job losses": "The expert subtracted the average job losses under President Obama from the average job losses under President Bush. This calculation revealed the specific difference in monthly job losses between the two presidents.", "Month": "to-month comparisons: The expert examined all possible month-to-month comparisons between the two presidents' job loss figures. This analysis aimed to identify if any individual comparison had a difference smaller than 200,000, which was the benchmark set by Rep. Hoyer. This provided additional evidence to support or challenge Hoyer's claim."}
