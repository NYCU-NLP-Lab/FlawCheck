{"Video evidence": "The expert's verdict mentions that a live video of Amit Shah's address at the rally was uploaded by the BJP, where he can be heard claiming that no slogans of 'Vande Mataram' and 'Bharat Mata ki Jai' were raised. This video serves as evidence to verify the authenticity of the claim.", "Media reports": "The expert's verdict states that mainstream media outlets, including Hindustan Times and Republic TV, reported on Amit Shah's assertion that no slogans of 'Vande Mataram' and 'Bharat Mata ki Jai' were raised at the rally. These media reports can be considered as additional sources to verify the claim.", "Full video of the event": "The expert's verdict mentions that the over 5-hour video of the United India Rally, where opposition parties came together, does not validate Amit Shah's statements. At a specific timestamp in the full video, Mamata Banerjee, the West Bengal chief minister, can be heard chanting 'Vande Mataram'. This contradicts Shah's claim and serves as evidence against it.", "Statements by other leaders": "The expert's verdict highlights that other leaders, such as Hardik Patel and HD Deve Gowda, made speeches at the rally where they mentioned slogans like 'Bharat Mata ki Jai' and 'Jai Bharat'. These statements by other leaders further contradict Amit Shah's claim and provide additional evidence to question its authenticity."}
