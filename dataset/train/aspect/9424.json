{"Physical characteristics": "The expert points out that the alleged fish in the video does not look like a real fish. It does not have the typical appearance or movement of a fish, and its face resembles the children's character Thomas the Tank Engine.", "Lack of credible sources": "The expert mentions that despite the video being shared on various platforms and in different languages, there is no specific information or news reports about the alleged discovery of a fish with a human face. This lack of credible sources raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Altered story": "The expert highlights that the story behind the video has been repeatedly altered without any new information coming to light. Different captions and claims have been added as the video circulated, including references to alien fish, crossbreeding, nuclear fallout, and reincarnation. These changing narratives suggest a lack of consistency and credibility.", "Analysis by an animator": "The expert refers to a Chinese-language website that interviewed an animator shortly after the video went viral. The animator confirms that the light reflection and texture of the face in the video indicate that it is a 3D computer animation, not a real fish with a human face. This professional analysis provides further evidence against the authenticity of the claim."}
