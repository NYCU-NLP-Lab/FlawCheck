{"Calculation based on total value of 401": "k) accounts: The experts verified that the Clinton campaign calculated the $100 billion figure by taking the total value of all 401(k) accounts, which was $4.8 trillion as of March 31, 2016, and factored in any growth through June 23, the day before the Brexit vote, and the subsequent fall.", "Consideration of stock market and fixed income": "The campaign's calculation took into account changes in the U.S. stock market and fixed income, which together account for about 93% of 401(k) assets. This ensured that the impact of the Brexit vote on these asset classes was accounted for in estimating the loss.", "Expert validation of the calculation": "Wade Pfau, an expert in retirement finance, and Jack VanDerHei, research director of the Employee Benefit Research Institute, both confirmed that the campaign's calculation was a reasonable and fair assessment of the impact on 401(k) accounts. They acknowledged that the analysis correctly considered the extent of the impact and may have even underestimated the loss.", "Lack of specific daily log of 401": "k) values: The experts acknowledged that while there was no ongoing daily log of the total value of Americans' 401(k) accounts, the Clinton campaign's approach of using the total value as of March 31, 2016, and factoring in market changes was a valid method to estimate the loss caused by Brexit."}
