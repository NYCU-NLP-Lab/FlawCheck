{"Weatherford": "s statement: House Speaker Will Weatherford claimed that \"almost 1,000 people a day\" are moving to Florida because they are more free there than in some other states. This is the initial claim that needs to be verified for authenticity.", "Population growth": "Weatherford's spokesman provided a Sarasota Herald-Tribune article that reported Florida's booming population growth. The article stated that Florida's population is projected to swell by 360,000 in a year. Weatherford divided this number by 365 to arrive at the figure of \"almost 1,000 people a day\" moving to Florida.", "Moody": "s Analytics projection: Moody's Analytics senior economist, Chris Lafakis, confirmed that the figure provided by Weatherford is based on net migration, which includes people moving into Florida from other countries as well as other states. This supports the claim that people are indeed relocating to Florida.", "Historical migration data": "Census figures from different decades were cited to provide context. It was mentioned that people have been moving to Florida since its founding, with varying average daily migration numbers depending on the political climate and economic conditions. This suggests that people moving to Florida is not a new phenomenon and may not solely be due to the state's perceived freedom."}
