{"Multiple sources were consulted to verify the claim": "The expert reached out to state Sen. Dan Patrick's office, the Texas Education Agency, and the Texas Charter Schools Association to gather information and data on the waiting lists for Texas charter schools.", "The expert analyzed the statements made by state Sen": "Dan Patrick regarding the number of families and students on the waitlist. The expert noted that Patrick initially mentioned \"100,000 families\" and later stated \"155,000 students...approximately, as I said, 101,000 are on the waitlist.\" This analysis helped in understanding the different figures provided by Patrick.", "The Texas Charter Schools Association provided data on the waiting list numbers reported by its members": "The expert examined the survey conducted by the association, which involved 67 charter operators representing 87% of Texas charter school students in 2012. The wait lists reported by these operators totaled 101,851 students.", "The expert compared the number of students on the waitlist to the total enrollment in Texas public schools": "According to the state Sunset Commission, the 155,000 charter school enrollees represented approximately 3% of Texas public school students.
