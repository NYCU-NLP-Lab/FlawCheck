{"The claim is based on a statement made by Don Disney": "a retired Kentucky coalminer, who alleges that Mitch McConnell voted to raise his Medicare costs by $6,000.", "The claim is supported by the Grimes campaign": "which states that the $6,000 number comes from several studies on the effect of the 2011 Ryan budget on retirees.", "The 2011 Ryan budget proposed a drastic change to Medicare for future retirees": "replacing government payments to doctors and hospitals with a voucher system for purchasing private health insurance. This change could potentially result in increased out-of-pocket costs for seniors.", "While McConnell did vote for a motion to proceed on the Ryan budget": "it was a preliminary vote and not a vote on final passage. Budget resolutions are also not legally binding, requiring subsequent legislation to actually change Medicare programs. Therefore, it is difficult to directly attribute the $6,000 increase in Medicare costs to McConnell's vote."}
