{"The expert checked past records and spoke with a longtime plant worker to verify if S": "K Industries, the gunstock manufacturing company mentioned by Josh Hawley, had shut down its facilities before the Remington sale. It was confirmed that S&K never shut down its facilities before the sale.", "The expert found a 2010 air pollution permit with the Missouri Department of Natural Resources that confirmed the purchase of one facility by Remington Arms in September 2009": "This provided evidence that a gunstock manufacturing facility in Lexington was indeed sold to Remington.", "The expert discovered another 2010 air pollution permit for S": "K Industries to operate a \"new wood trophy parts and plaque painting process\" at a different location in Lexington. This permit indicated that S&K had previously housed a gunstock manufacturing facility there, which had been shut down in December 2008.", "The expert also found posts on an online forum for gun owners suggesting that S": "K Industries was still selling gunstocks from 2008 to the sale, indicating that the other locations were still in operation. This further supported the authenticity of Josh Hawley's claim."}
