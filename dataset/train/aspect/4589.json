{"The claim is based on an article published by InfoWars": "a conspiracy-minded website, which raises questions about the credibility of the source.", "The article cites the account of Philip Haney": "a former Homeland Security agent, as the primary evidence for the claim. However, Haney's previous claims have been questioned for lacking sufficient evidence.", "The 2011 investigation described by Haney did not directly target the mosque attended by Omar Mateen": "undermining the claim that the State Department blocked an investigation into the specific mosque.", "The claim relies on connecting various Islamic organizations and individuals": "such as the Tablighi Jamaat and the Institute of Islamic Education, but these connections do not establish a direct link between the mosque and the State Department's alleged blocking of the investigation."}
