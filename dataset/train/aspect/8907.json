{"The claim that Ukraine donated more money than any other country to the Clinton Foundation is inaccurate and misleading": "The source of this claim is a right-leaning website, Lifezette, which reported that Ukraine donated $10 million to the foundation. However, this information is based on a chart published by The Wall Street Journal in 2015, which recorded individual donor contributions by nationality, not government donations.", "The expert": "s verdict highlights that between 2009 and 2013, the Clinton Foundation received at least $8.6 million from the Victor Pinchuk Foundation, based in Kiev, Ukraine. Victor Pinchuk, a Ukrainian businessman and former member of the Ukrainian Parliament, donated to Clinton charities after being introduced to Bill Clinton by Doug Schoen, a pollster who has worked for both Clintons.", "Pinchuk": "s donations were specifically pledged to fund a program aimed at training future Ukrainian leaders and professionals to modernize Ukraine. This program, known as the Clinton Global Initiative, is a wing of the foundation that coordinates charitable projects and funding but does not handle the money directly. The Clinton Foundation states that several alumni of this program are current members of the Ukrainian Parliament.", "It is important to note that while Hunter Biden": "the son of former Vice President Joe Biden, served on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company, he has not been accused of any criminal conduct in connection with that position. The expert's verdict clarifies that the claim about Ukraine donating the most money to the Clinton Foundation is unrelated to Hunter Biden's involvement with Burisma."}
