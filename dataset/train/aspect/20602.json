{"Legal action by New York Attorney General Barbara Underwood": "The expert's verdict mentions that in June 2018, Underwood sued President Donald Trump, his son Eric, and daughter Ivanka, along with the Donald J. Trump Foundation charity. Underwood accused them of persistent violation of state and federal laws governing New York State charities, including improper political activity and self-dealing transactions.", "Request for dissolution and penalties": "Underwood asked the New York State Supreme Court to dissolve the Trump Foundation due to its persistently illegal conduct. She also requested the court to bar the president from running any New York-based charities for 10 years and the other directors for one year. The aim was to obtain restitution, penalties, and direct the Foundation to distribute its remaining assets to qualified charitable entities.", "Agreement to dissolve the Trump Foundation": "In December 2018, an agreement was reached between the attorney general and the defendants to dissolve the Trump Foundation. The assets of the Foundation were to be distributed to a list of agreed charities.", "Ongoing scrutiny and public sharing of allegations": "The expert's verdict notes that the running of Trump family-related businesses and charities has been the subject of intense scrutiny and legal action for several years. The claim gained renewed attention in October 2019 after a tweet went viral, alleging that the Trump family was disallowed from operating any charity in New York because they stole from a children's cancer charity."}
