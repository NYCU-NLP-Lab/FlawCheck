{"Testimony of Marie Yovanovitch": "Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine, testified before the House Intelligence Committee during the public impeachment hearings. Her testimony provided insights into her career record and actions taken in Ukraine.", "Lack of evidence from the White House": "The White House was asked to provide evidence supporting the claim that \"everywhere Marie Yovanovitch went turned bad,\" but no response or evidence was provided. This lack of evidence raises questions about the authenticity of the claim.", "Expert opinions": "Foreign policy experts and political scientists, including Michael Kofman and Ken Menkhaus, expressed their views on the claim. They stated that it was unreasonable to believe that one person could single-handedly turn a country \"bad.\" Their expert opinions add credibility to the argument against the claim.", "Yovanovitch": "s work in Somalia and Ukraine: While it was difficult to pinpoint the exact timeline of Yovanovitch's tenure in Somalia, it was established that she served there in the late 1980s. Yovanovitch mentioned her work towards fighting corruption in Ukraine, which contradicts the claim that \"everywhere she went turned bad.\" These details provide evidence that challenges the claim's authenticity."}
