{"Testimony from Mike Huckabee himself": "The expert's verdict includes quotes from Huckabee where he explicitly talks about frying squirrels in a popcorn popper during his college days. This direct testimony from the person involved adds credibility to the claim.", "Corroborating witness account": "The expert tracked down Huckabee's college roommate, Rick Caldwell, who confirmed that they had a popcorn popper in their dorm room and Huckabee was indeed an enterprising chef who cooked squirrel using it. Caldwell's testimony supports the authenticity of the claim.", "Comparison to other food experiences": "The expert sought the opinion of \"Bayou Bill\" Scifres, a retired outdoors writer and cooking expert, who confirmed that cooking squirrels is a common practice and shared various ways to prepare them. This comparison to other food experiences adds further credibility to the claim.", "Lack of contradictory evidence": "The expert mentions that none of the PolitiFact staff had personally sampled squirrel meat, but there is no evidence presented to contradict Huckabee's claim. The absence of contradictory evidence can be seen as a supporting aspect in verifying the authenticity of the claim."}
