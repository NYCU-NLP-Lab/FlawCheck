{"Lack of credible sources": "The expert's verdict mentions that they could find no evidence of Edward Snowden ever making such a claim about Osama bin Laden. This indicates that there are no credible sources or statements from Snowden to support the authenticity of the claim.", "Origin of the claim": "The expert's verdict states that the claim originated on WorldNewsDailyReport.com, a parody website known for publishing fictional and satirical content. This suggests that the claim is likely to be false and not based on factual information.", "Inconsistencies in the story": "The claim mentions that Snowden allegedly stated that the United States set up bin Laden with a retirement fund through the CIA payroll. However, this contradicts the widely accepted narrative that bin Laden was killed by U.S. Navy SEALs in 2011. The presence of such inconsistencies raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Lack of corroboration": "The expert's verdict mentions that versions of the story have appeared on other websites, but there is no mention of any credible news sources or independent verification supporting the claim. The absence of corroboration from reliable sources further undermines the authenticity of the claim."}
