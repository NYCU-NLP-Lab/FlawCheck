{"Rigorous testing in clinical trials": "The safety of vaccines is ensured through extensive testing in clinical trials before authorization or approval. This includes evaluating different doses, checking for expected immune responses, and monitoring for potential safety issues.", "Continued safety monitoring": "Once a vaccine is rolled out to the public, there is ongoing monitoring to detect potential rare side effects. This includes programs like the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) and the CDC's Vaccine Safety Datalink, which identify adverse events related to vaccination in near real time.", "Inspection of vaccine production facilities": "The Food and Drug Administration inspects vaccine production facilities and reviews manufacturing protocols to ensure that vaccine doses are of high-quality and free of contaminants.", "Expert review and evaluation": "The COVID-19 vaccines underwent randomized controlled trials involving tens of thousands of people, which were reviewed by multiple groups of experts. These trials revealed no serious safety issues and demonstrated that the benefits of the vaccines outweigh the risks."}
