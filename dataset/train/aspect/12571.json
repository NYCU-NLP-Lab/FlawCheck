{"Trump": "s statement that the immigrants arrested were responsible for homicides, sexual assaults, and burglaries/thefts is misleading because these are arrests, not convictions, and the charges do not all pertain to immigrants living in the country illegally as he claims.", "Trump misrepresented Texas crime data on immigrants": "claiming that the numbers pertained to illegal immigrants when they actually pertain to all immigrants, both legal and illegal.", "The": "more than half a million criminal offenses\" that Trump cites are charges, not convictions, and they occurred over the immigrants' lifetimes, not just between 2011 and 2016 as he suggests."}
