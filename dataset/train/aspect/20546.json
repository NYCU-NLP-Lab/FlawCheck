{"Former Vice President Joe Biden": "s statement during the Democratic presidential primary debate that \"160 million people like their private insurance\" was a key claim that needed to be verified for authenticity.", "The expert": "s verdict also mentioned that beneficiaries with higher deductible plans, where they need to pay larger sums out-of-pocket before coverage kicks in, are less likely to be satisfied with their insurance and more likely to report problems paying for healthcare. This aspect highlights the impact of plan design on individuals' satisfaction with their private insurance.", "However": "the same poll also revealed that around 40% of people with employer-sponsored coverage faced difficulties paying medical bills, out-of-pocket costs, or premiums. Additionally, about half of the respondents indicated that they had to go without or delay healthcare due to affordability issues, even with their coverage. These findings highlight potential limitations and challenges associated with private insurance, which may contradict Biden's claim."}
