{"The expert contacted the Curry County Sheriff": "s Office to inquire about the claim and the response time for 911 calls. The executive assistant, Lisa Combs, stated that an hour wait is not the norm for 911 calls in Curry County.", "The expert learned that the Curry County Sheriff": "s Office currently has only four road deputies, with two additional deputies dedicated to marine calls, to cover a large area of 1,648 square miles. This limited number of deputies can result in longer response times, especially if they are located far away from the location of the 911 call.", "The expert discovered that in May": "Curry County voters rejected a $4.5 million five-year property tax increase that would have increased the number of deputies from four to 12. This indicates that there is a lack of funding to adequately staff the sheriff's office and reduce response times.", "The chairman of the Curry County Board of Commissioners": "David Brock Smith, confirmed that a decade ago, the county had more than a dozen deputies on patrol. The failed tax increase would have allowed for two deputies to be on patrol 24/7, resulting in a maximum response time of less than 30 minutes. This suggests that the current response time of an hour is longer than it used to be due to staffing and funding issues."}
