{"The first aspect employed to verify the authenticity of the claim is the scientific consensus on climate change": "The expert points out that there is a broad scientific consensus that human factors, particularly carbon dioxide emissions, are the main contributor to global warming. This consensus is based on extensive research and observational data.", "The second aspect is the actual climate record": "The expert highlights that the Earth is currently experiencing record-high temperatures, which can be directly observed and measured. This contradicts Limbaugh's claim that climate change is only based on computer models and not real-world evidence.", "The third aspect is the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change": "IPCC), which is recognized as the world's leading authority on climate change. The IPCC has concluded with high confidence that the impacts of global warming have already been observed in natural and human systems. This further supports the existence of climate change and refutes Limbaugh's assertion that it is solely based on computer models.", "The fourth aspect is the accuracy of climate change predictions made by computer models": "The expert cites the analysis of climate scientist Zeke Hausfather, who found that climate models have been quite accurate in predicting warming over the past 30 years. This demonstrates that the predictions made by these models are not arbitrary or distant, as Limbaugh claimed, but have been validated by subsequent observations."}
