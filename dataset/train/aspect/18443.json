McCurry, a former press secretary for Bill Clinton. This verifies the claim that there is a connection between the Commission and Bill Clinton.", "The expert also pointed out that the other co": "chair of the Commission is Frank J. Fahrenkopf Jr., who was the chairman of the Republican National Committee. This highlights the nonpartisan nature of the Commission and counters the notion that it is solely influenced by Bill Clinton.", "The expert further emphasized that since 1989": "no sitting officer of either major party has had any affiliation with the Commission on Presidential Debates.
