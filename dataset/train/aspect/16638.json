{"Video evidence": "The expert's verdict mentions that there is a video of the oath-taking ceremony where Asaduddin Owaisi can be seen responding with chants of 'Jai Bheem', 'Jai Meem', 'Takbir Allahu Akbar' and 'Jai Hind' after the chants of 'Jai Shri Ram' were raised. This video serves as concrete evidence to verify the authenticity of the claim.", "Media reports": "Several media organizations reported on the oath-taking ceremony and mentioned the chants raised by both the MPs and Owaisi's response. The expert's verdict highlights that these reports, including those from ANI, Business Standard, The Times of India, The Economic Times, India Today, and Aaj Tak, all corroborate the claim by mentioning the chants and Owaisi's response.", "Title of the reports": "The expert's verdict points out that the titles of some media reports were misleading and clickbait, as they only drew a parallel between 'Jai Shri Ram' and 'Allahu Akbar'. However, the fact that these titles were later updated or changed suggests that there was an acknowledgment of the initial misleading nature of the titles. This aspect helps in verifying the authenticity of the claim.", "Social media posts": "The expert's verdict mentions that tweets by The Economic Times listed all the slogans raised during the oath-taking ceremony. These tweets further support the claim by providing additional evidence of the chants of 'Jai Shri Ram' and Owaisi's response of 'Allahu Akbar'."}
