{"Exit poll results from Florida show that only 29 percent of self": "described \"conservative\" Republican voters voted for McCain, which is less than the 37 percent who voted for Mitt Romney. This indicates that McCain did not receive a significant percentage of the conservative vote in Florida.", "Among": "very conservative\" voters in Florida, McCain only won 21 percent of the vote, while Romney received 44 percent. This further demonstrates that McCain did not perform well among the more conservative voters.", "Comparisons to earlier primaries in New Hampshire and South Carolina show that McCain": "s percentage of conservative voters in Florida was similar to his performance in those states. This suggests that McCain's claim of a \"very large percentage\" of conservative voters in Florida is not supported by a significant improvement from earlier primaries.", "Stuart Rothenberg": "an expert in political analysis, states that McCain has not demonstrated the ability to coalesce the conservative vote and that conservatives have not warmed to him entirely. This expert opinion reinforces the idea that McCain's claim of a \"very large percentage\" of conservative voters in Florida is not accurate."}
