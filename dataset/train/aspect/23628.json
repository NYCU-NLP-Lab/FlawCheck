{"The proposed budget includes tax and fee increases": "The expert's verdict confirms that Governor Tony Evers' proposed budget does include tax and fee increases. This is supported by the report from the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau, which is considered reliable in state fiscal matters.", "Offsetting tax increases with other changes": "While there are tax increases in the budget, the expert's verdict explains that some of these increases are offset by other changes. For example, the gas tax would increase, but the plan also includes repealing a law that requires retailers to sell gas at a higher price. Additionally, the budget scales back an agricultural and manufacturing tax credit to help pay for an income tax cut for the middle class.", "The budget creates a deficit": "The expert's verdict acknowledges that the claim about Governor Evers spending \"more on his way to a nearly $2 billion deficit\" is partially true. While the budget is balanced for 2019 and 2020, the spending patterns it establishes would create a shortfall of $847 million for 2021, according to the report from the Legislative Fiscal Bureau.", "The existence of a": "structural deficit\": The expert's verdict explains that the term \"structural deficit\" refers to a projected gap or surplus in future years based on spending and income trends. While the budget is balanced for the proposed two-year period, it reveals a structural deficit of $847 million for 2021. This suggests that there are concerns about the long-term sustainability of the budget."}
