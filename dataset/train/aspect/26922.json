{"The claim is supported by a statement made by the committee chairman": "Rep. Jim Jordan, who emphasized that \"the vast majority of all retailers, and 80 percent of all U.S. communities, depend solely on trucks to deliver and supply the products sold in stores or ordered online.\"", "The claim is further supported by the statement of Meghan Snyder": "press secretary for Rep. Jim Jordan, who mentioned that the 80 percent figure came from the American Trucking Associations, which cited the Rand McNally Commercial Atlas & Marketing Guide.", "Darrin Roth": "director of highway operations for the American Trucking Associations, confirmed the 80 percent figure and explained that they derived it by finding the number of communities served by railroads (18.3 percent) and calculating the inverse.", "The spreadsheet from Rand McNally": "provided by Darrin Roth, showed state-by-state figures for rail service, including a slightly smaller percentage for Ohio, where 627 communities out of a total of 3,516 (or 17.8 percent) were shown to have rail service. This data indirectly supports the claim that a significant majority of communities rely on truck deliveries, as the percentage of communities with rail service is much lower."}
