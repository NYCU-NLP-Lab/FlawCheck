{"Lack of supporting evidence": "The expert's verdict states that the available evidence does not support the claim made by Boss Mustapha regarding the N-Power program's success in lifting 5 million Nigerians out of extreme poverty. This suggests that there is a lack of concrete data or documentation to verify the claim.", "Discrepancy in official numbers": "The expert's verdict highlights the discrepancy between the figures provided by Mustapha and the official numbers available on the National Social Investment Office's website. The official numbers from June 2019 indicate a much lower count of beneficiaries compared to Mustapha's claim, raising doubts about the accuracy of the claim.", "Unverified source of figures": "The expert's verdict mentions that both the presidency and the National Social Investment Office have not responded to requests for the source of the figures mentioned by Mustapha. This lack of transparency and failure to provide the source of the data raises concerns about the authenticity of the claim.", "Contradictory expert opinions": "The expert's verdict also includes the opinions of Nigerian development experts who state that Mustapha's claims cannot be proven. The existence of differing expert opinions further adds to the uncertainty surrounding the authenticity of the claim."}
