{"The expert": "Mischa Dohler, Chair Professor of Wireless Communications at King\u2019s College London, stated that microchips under the skin cannot be used to operate a 5G mobile phone. He explained that microchips and 5G have nothing in common and that comparing them is like comparing apples and a car.", "Dohler mentioned that microchips do exist and are currently used in Nordic countries": "where they can be implanted under the skin and used for payment purposes. However, he emphasized that these microchips cannot enable smartphone users to make and receive calls without having their phone in hand.", "The expert explained that for communication to occur": "soundwaves need to be generated, so a microchip would need to be very close to the ear or implanted close to the brain. He dismissed the claim that a microchip under the skin could allow 5G mobile phone usage.", "Luyun Jiang": "a technology analyst at IDTechEx, a market research company, supported Dohler's statements. Jiang mentioned that the type of technology used in microchips can only handle very limited data and cannot be used for making and receiving phone calls."}
