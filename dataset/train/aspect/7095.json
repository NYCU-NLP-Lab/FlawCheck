The article mentioned that there were several other staffers and aides on the plane, including Bo and one aide.", "Comparison of aircraft": "The expert investigated the type of aircraft used by the Obamas during their visit. It was found that the Obamas opted for a Gulfstream G3, as the Trenton airport runway was too small for the usual Air Force One Boeing 747. The Gulfstream G3 could accommodate up to 19 passengers, including Bo and the accompanying aides.", "Verification of the pet air travel industry": "The expert mentioned being fascinated with the pet air travel industry, indicating that they might have researched or consulted relevant sources to determine the authenticity of the claim.
