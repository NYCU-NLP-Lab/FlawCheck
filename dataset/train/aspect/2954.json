{"The claim is based on President Donald Trump": "s statement during a campaign-style event in Washington, Mich., where he stated that the United States had spent $7 trillion in the Middle East.", "The expert": "s verdict mentions that Trump inaccurately treated money that university researchers have predicted will be spent in the future as if it were already spent. This indicates that the claim is based on projected future costs rather than actual expenditures.", "The White House pointed to a couple of studies to support Trump": "s claim. One of the studies mentioned is a 2016 analysis by a Boston University political scientist, Neta Crawford, which calculated that the United States had already appropriated, spent, or taken on obligations to spend more than $3.6 trillion on the wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Syria, as well as on Homeland Security, by August 2016.", "Another aspect mentioned is the estimated future cost of treating wounded veterans through 2053": "along with the money allocated to the Defense Department for fighting wars. These future costs, along with interest on the debt, were factored in to reach a total of nearly $8 trillion over 35 years, as estimated by Neta Crawford using unpublished projections from an economist."}
