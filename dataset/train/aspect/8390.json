{"The claim made by the Conservative Solutions PAC that Donald Trump": "bans disabled veterans from his high rise\" was found to be misleading. The expert's verdict clarified that Trump did not ban disabled veterans from his high rise but instead wanted to restrict disabled veterans who were given special licenses to peddle from selling their wares in front of his high rise.", "The ad by the PAC initially stated that Trump": "bans disabled veterans from his high rise,\" but the wording was later changed after the ad started running on TV. The expert's verdict took into account the original claim made in the ad and also explained the subsequent alteration of the wording.", "The ad referenced a headline from the Daily Beast that stated": "Donald Trump wanted vets kicked off Fifth Avenue.\" However, the expert's verdict pointed out that the headline was misleading and did not accurately represent the situation. Trump had expressed concerns about turning Fifth Avenue into an outdoor flea market due to the peddling exemptions for disabled veterans.", "The expert": "s verdict provided historical context by mentioning that peddling exemptions for disabled veterans have a long history in New York, dating back to 1894. It highlighted the compromise reached in 1991 between New York City Mayor David Dinkins and the Fifth Avenue Association, which offered disabled veterans jobs at twice the minimum wage and set up a fund for job training or relocation of vendors. The 1995 renewal of the bill banned peddling in Midtown Manhattan but allowed it in other defined zones."}
