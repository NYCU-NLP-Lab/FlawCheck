{"The scientific explanation of non": "ionizing radiation: The expert explains that the claim does not make sense scientifically because the type of radiation used by cell towers (radio waves) is non-ionizing and does not have the energy to cause harm to DNA or cause cancer.", "Ineffectiveness of the hazmat suit": "The expert points out that even if the cell tower emitted ionizing radiation (which it does not), the hazmat suit worn by the worker in the image would not provide protection against it. The suit is designed to protect against particulates and contaminants, not ionizing radiation.", "Questionable utility of the image": "The expert highlights that the image itself originated from an Instagram page known for promoting pseudoscience and anti-vaccination narratives. The lack of additional details about the location and time of the photograph raises doubts about its relevance and credibility in supporting the claim.", "Assumption": "based claim: The expert concludes that the claim is based solely on assumptions derived from observing the image. There is no factual evidence or supporting information to validate the claim that people working with 5G equipment are required to use hazmat suits for protection against radiation."}
