{"The expert analysis shows that a small percentage of the spending in the American Rescue Plan is directed at combating the virus through vaccines": "protective equipment, or resources for healthcare providers. This verifies the claim that only 9% of the plan is COVID-related.", "The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates that COVID": "19 \"containment\" efforts in the plan amount to $110 billion, or 6% of the total bill. This supports the claim that a portion of the spending is specifically targeted at COVID containment.", "President Joe Biden stated that": "160 billion would go towards COVID-19 testing, protective gear, vaccine production, and distribution. Even if this higher number is considered, it would still mean that the funds directed to fight COVID account for roughly 8.4% of the $1.9 trillion. This further corroborates the claim that a significant portion of the plan is COVID-related.", "Erica York at the Tax Foundation and Stan Veuger at the American Enterprise Institute both described economic relief efforts in the plan as": "COVID-related.\" This indicates that a substantial part of the plan aims to offer economic relief to businesses and individuals affected by the pandemic, supporting the assertion that the bill is related to COVID-19."}
