{"Analysis of inflation rates": "The expert analyzed the data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 Consumer Price Index to determine if prices have been increasing at a faster rate as claimed. They found that the year-over-year inflation rate has been accelerating since November 2010, supporting the claim that prices are going up.", "Examination of gasoline prices": "The expert consulted with Cheryl Abbot, an economist at the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, who explained that the price spike is mainly due to gasoline prices. By considering the impact of gasoline prices on the overall inflation rate, they were able to determine the validity of the claim regarding price increases.", "Assessment of unemployment rates": "The expert analyzed the unemployment data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics to assess the claim that unemployment is continuing to go up. They found that although there had been a consistent decrease in unemployment rates for the past few months, there was a slight uptick in April. However, they disagreed with the claim that unemployment is continuously increasing.", "Timing of information release": "The expert noted that the data regarding the slight increase in unemployment in April was released after the claim was made during the debate. This suggests that the claim may not have been based on the most up-to-date information available, casting doubt on its accuracy."}
