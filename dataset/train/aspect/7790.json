{"Testimony from a former NewsX employee": "Alt News reached out to a former NewsX employee who confirmed that two guests on the panel, Arshiya Bhalla and Srishti Goel, are current journalists with the channel. This testimony provides evidence that NewsX journalists were posing as students during the debate.", "Statements made by the anchor": "During the show, the anchor, Devika Chopra, introduced the guests as students, creating the impression that all the participants were students. However, later in the video, Bhalla and Goel were referred to as professionals or young professionals, indicating that they were not actually students.", "Comments and views expressed by the guests": "Both Bhalla and Goel expressed their opinions on the anti-CAA protests, with Bhalla appearing to disapprove of the protests and Goel supporting citizens' right to protest. These comments suggest that the guests were not genuine students but had their own perspectives as journalists.", "Inconsistencies in the introduction of the guests": "The guests were initially introduced as students, with Bhalla introduced as a student at 5:54 and Goel introduced as a Jamia student at 8:30. However, later in the show, they were referred to as professionals or young professionals. This inconsistency raises doubts about their actual identities as students."}
