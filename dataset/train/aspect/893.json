{"Lack of evidence": "The expert's verdict highlights that John Ratcliffe, the former Director of National Intelligence, did not provide any evidence to support the claim that the Chinese government is genetically altering its soldiers. This lack of evidence raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Technological limitations": "The BBC analysis mentioned in the expert's verdict raises doubts about the feasibility of genetically enhancing adult soldiers with the current available technology. This aspect questions the practicality of the claim and adds to the skepticism surrounding it.", "Denial by China": "According to the expert's verdict, China has denied the allegations made by Ratcliffe, calling them a \"miscellany of lies.\" The fact that China has explicitly refuted the claim adds another layer of doubt to its authenticity.", "Comparison with other countries": "The expert's verdict mentions that other countries, such as France and the U.S., have also considered using technology to enhance the capabilities of their soldiers. This comparison suggests that the concept of genetically modifying soldiers is not exclusive to China, further undermining the uniqueness and credibility of the claim."}
