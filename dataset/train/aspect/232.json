{"Official data from 2017 shows that only 5": "3% of people of working age in South Africa were born outside the country. This contradicts the claim that almost 100% of restaurant workers are foreign.", "Data from 2001 indicates that 4": "8% of people categorized as \"housekeeping and restaurant workers\" were foreign-born. This figure increased to a high of 11.3% in 2011 and then dropped to 6.5% in 2017. This suggests that the percentage of foreign-born restaurant workers has fluctuated over time, but it is far from reaching almost 100%.", "The South African finance minister": "Tito Mboweni, made the claim about the high percentage of non-South African restaurant workers in April 2020. However, his statement lacks concrete evidence or specific data to support it.", "The annual Labour Market Dynamics report by Statistics South Africa includes a": "migration module\" that provides data on the country's working population. The latest available data is from 2017, and it shows that only 5.3% of people of working age in South Africa were born outside the country. This data further contradicts the claim made by the finance minister."}
