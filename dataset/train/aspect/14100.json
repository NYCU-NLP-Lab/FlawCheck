{"The ad by the Greater Wisconsin Committee overstated Tony Evers": "role in the case of the teacher viewing pornography at school and the subsequent changes in state law.", "The arbitrator ruled that the teacher should have been given a suspension instead of being fired": "based on the fact that other employees had received lesser punishments for similar actions.", "The arbitrator also determined that the teacher": "s behavior did not endanger any students as defined by state law at the time.", "Two courts upheld the arbitrator": "s decision to overturn the firing, but the ad's claim that \"two judges said it was illegal\" to fire the teacher is an overstatement."}
