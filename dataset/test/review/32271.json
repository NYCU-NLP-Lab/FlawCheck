Scott Walker's main challenger, Democrat Mary Burke.", "On Feb. 4, 2014, the state Republican Party issued a news release attacking Burke, who served as state commerce secretary during part of Doyle's tenure, for not having proposed a jobs plan.", "Among other things, the party said Doyle-Burke policies led to the loss of 133,000 jobs, a claim previously made by Walker that we rated Mostly False. Walker had said Burke \"implemented the policies\" of Doyle and those policies \"saw the state lose more than 133,000 jobs.\" The number was right but other factors, namely the Great Recession, were primarily to blame.", "Another line in the state GOP's news release also referenced Burke, albeit more benignly, in making this claim:", "\"The only time over the last 25 years when the state\u2019s unemployment rate exceeded the U.S. average was when Burke was commerce secretary.\"", "Let\u2019s take a look.", "The numbers", "Asked for evidence to back its claim, the Republican Party referred us to monthly unemployment rates for Wisconsin and the U.S. from 1988 through 2013.
