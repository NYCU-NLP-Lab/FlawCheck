["By Robert Farley and Lori Robertson", "Posted on July 16, 2019", "President Donald Trump accused Rep. Ilhan Omar of professing a \u201clove\u201d for al Qaeda and talking about \u201chow great\u201d and \u201chow wonderful\u201d al Qaeda is. That is false.", "Trump also misleadingly claimed polls showed Omar only has 8% support, not mentioning that a similar figure is from a poll of white likely general-election voters without a bachelor\u2019s degree.", "Responding to press questions about his tweets on July 14 telling four progressive Democratic congresswomen known as \u201cthe squad\u201d to \u201cgo back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested [countries] from which they came,\u201d Trump doubled down, claiming the women \u201chate our country\u201d and that \u201cif they\u2019re not happy here, they can leave.\u201d", "In his comments, Trump repeatedly singled out Minnesota Rep. Omar \u2014 a Somali American who became one of the\u00a0first two Muslim women elected to Congress in November \u2014 claiming, falsely, that she has made statements supporting al Qaeda.", "Trump said that Omar has\u00a0talked about \u201chow great\u201d and \u201chow wonderful al Qaeda is.\u201d He claimed that Omar had said, \u201c\u2018When I think of al Qaeda, I can hold my chest out.'\u201d There\u2019s no evidence Omar has said any of those things.", "Trump, July 15: I mean, I look at the one \u2014 I look at Omar \u2014 I don\u2019t know, I never met her. I hear the way she talks about al Qaeda. Al Qaeda has killed many Americans. She said, \u201cYou can hold your chest out, you can \u2026 when I think of al Qaeda, I can hold my chest out.\u201d \u2026", "And politicians can\u2019t be afraid to take them on. A politician that hears somebody, where we\u2019re at war with al Qaeda, and sees somebody talking about how great al Qaeda is \u2014 pick out her statement \u2014 that was Omar. How great al Qaeda is \u2014 when you hear that \u2014 and we\u2019re losing great soldiers to al Qaeda. \u2026", "But when I hear the way they talk about our country, when I hear the anti-Semitic language they use, when I hear the hatred they have for Israel, and the love they have for enemies like al Qaeda \u2014 then you know what? I will tell you that I do not believe this is good for the Democrat Party.", "A tweet sent by Trump later in the day referred to Omar as \u201cpro Al-Qaeda.\u201d", "The White House press office did not provide any evidence to back up the president\u2019s claim. But Trump appears to be referring, wrongly, to comments Omar made in October 2013 during a local PBS show in the Twin Cities of Minnesota. The program, BelAhdan, is hosted by Ahmed Tharwat, who described it as a show that \u201cbrings Somali Americans to your living room.\u201d Omar\u2019s appearance as a local political organizer came on the heels of a deadly attack at a Kenyan mall by members of al-Shabab, a Somali Islamist militant group that declared its allegiance to al Qaeda in 2012.", "Ironically, the main discussion was about Omar\u2019s frustration that the entire Muslim community \u2014 and the Somali Muslim community in Minnesota in particular \u2014 is asked to respond to violent acts committed by extremists overseas.\u00a0She said there\u2019s \u201ca difference between the people that are carrying on the evil acts, because it is an evil act\u201d and \u201cthe normal people \u2026 who carry on their lives.\u201d", "Omar, Oct. 3, 2013: The last couple of days, we\u2019re seeing huge interest in getting the community to condemn the acts of al-Shabab and the attack in Kenya. And I find that quite interesting, because you don\u2019t see any other atrocities occur in any part of the world where you have the citizens asked to condemn the act. It does make sense if you have the president or some official to condemn something. But a regular citizen like myself to be asked to condemn an act that I am not part of, or to associate me with something that I have the same reaction to as anyone else, it\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. \u2026", "I think the assumption must be that we all are connected to this somehow. Besides the fact that we are ethnically the same, or share the same faith. But I think the general population needs to understand that there is a difference between the people that are carrying on the evil acts, because it is an evil act, and that we do have evil people in this world. And then the normal people \u2026 who carry on their lives \u2026 maybe there is no such thing. But that\u2019s another day, another subject.", "Later in the interview, Omar was even more explicit in condemning al-Shabab.", "\u201cThese people are taking part in terror and their whole ideology is based on terrorizing the communities that they would like to have an influence in,\u201d Omar said, later adding that she does not share the group\u2019s ideology.", "Omar, Oct. 13, 2013: When you have an individual inside a Western society that does go on and does commit mass murders, we have mass shootings that happen constantly here, we investigate that person, and what has driven them to commit that act. When an act is committed by these Muslim, you know, terrorists, what we investigate is that whole community. We investigate that whole faith. We investigate that whole society. And everyone is supposed to have some answer to why these people are doing this, when it is those individuals that people need to be investigating. It is their lives that needs to be under the microscope, not the lives of the rest of the community. Because, I am not part of al-Shabab. I do not participate. \u2026 In the context of what al-Shabab stands for, I do not share that ideology. So for someone to require an explanation from me as to why they\u2019re committing these heinous acts, to me is inconceivable. It doesn\u2019t make any sense.", "The part of the interview that Trump distorted as Omar saying, \u201cWhen I think of al Qaeda, I can hold my chest out\u201d \u2014 words that Omar never said \u2014 arose when Omar described her experience during a college class on the ideology behind terrorism. (Omar graduated from North Dakota State University.) She said the professor in the class \u2014 whom she did not name \u2014 would raise his shoulders to emphasize words like al Qaeda or Hezbollah to give them extra \u201cweight.\u201d", "Tharwat: It\u2019s very interesting that we keep the Arabic name to such a violent or negative entity. Al Qaeda. Al-Shabab. Hezbollah. Have you ever thought about \u2026", "Omar: These things don\u2019t really mean. \u2026 They don\u2019t mean anything evil, right?", "Tharwat: Hezbollah: part of God; Al-Shabab: the youth. The madrasa. \u2026 Nobody in the Arab world wants to go to the madrasa anymore. \u2018Cause it means school. \u2026 They are polluting our language, our daily casual language.", "Omar: But that is, I think, a product of the sensationalized media. You have these sound bites, and you have these words, and everybody says it with such an intensity. And so it must mean, it must hold a bigger meaning. \u2026 I remember when I was in college I took a terrorism class. \u2026", "Tharwat: There was a lab for that? \u2026 You go on a field trip?", "Omar: No, we learned the ideology of \u2026", "And so, the thing that was interesting in the class was every time the professor said \u201cal Qaeda,\u201d he sort of, like, his shoulders went up.", "Tharwat: He\u2019s in command here.", "Omar: Al Qaeda. You know, Hezbollah [smiling, raising her shoulders].", "Tharwat: He\u2019s an expert. \u2026", "Omar: But it is that. You don\u2019t say \u201cAmerica\u201d with an intensity. You don\u2019t say \u201cEngland\u201d with an intensity [each time raising her shoulders and gesturing with her hands]. You don\u2019t say, \u201cthe Army\u201d with an intensity. But you say these names because you want that word to carry weight. You want it to leave something with the person that\u2019s hearing that.", "Tharwat: It has a cultural meaning. Not just \u2026", "Omar: Exactly. So it\u2019s said with a deeper voice. So yes, a lot of it is diluted, I think. When you hear a lot of people speaking in Arabic, suspicion arises. People start to pay attention and think, \u201cWhat must be they are talking about?\u201d", "Nowhere in the interview did Omar say, \u201cWhen I think of al Qaeda, I can hold my chest out\u201d \u2014 a phrase that suggests some sort of pride in the group that Omar never conveyed.", "In a press conference the same day Trump made his remarks, Omar refused to respond to Trump\u2019s accusations that she harbors pro-al Qaeda leanings.", "\u201cI know that every single Muslim who has lived in this country and across the world has heard that comment, and so I will not dignify it with an answer, because I know that every single Islamophobe, every single person who is hateful, who is driven by an ideology of \u2018othering\u2019 as this president is, rejoices in us responding to that and us defending ourselves,\u201d Omar said. \u201cI do not expect every time there is a white supremacist who attacks or there is a white man who kills in a school or in a movie theater or in a mosque or in a synagogue, I don\u2019t expect my white community members to respond on whether they love that person or not. And so I think it is beyond time \u2026 to ask Muslims to condemn terrorists. We are no longer going to allow the dignification of such a ridiculous, ridiculous statement.\u201d", "We could find no evidence that Omar has ever made any public comments supportive of al Qaeda.", "On Nov. 8, 2016, the day she was elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives, Omar wrote a letter to a federal judge \u2014 posted online by Snopes \u2014 seeking sentencing leniency for a Minneapolis man convicted of plotting to travel to Syria to join the Islamic State, and conspiring to provide material support to a terrorist organization and to commit murder overseas. The man faced a 30-year prison term. In her letter, Omar didn\u2019t offer any supportive words about ISIS, acknowledging the man made \u201ca consequential mistake.\u201d But she called on the judge to employ a \u201crestorative approach to justice\u201d and argued, \u201cThe best deterrent to fanaticism is a system of compassion.\u201d", "As the New York Times pointed out, Omar called out Saudi Arabia\u2019s royal family via tweet for helping to fund al Qaeda. And as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez noted via tweet on April 11, Omar is a cosponsor of H.R. 1327, a bill that seeks to fully fund the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund.", "In his public comments, Trump also criticized Omar for referring to the terrorists responsible for the 9/11 attacks as \u201csome people.\u201d When a controversy erupted in April over those comments \u2014 with some arguing her phrasing was dismissive of the attacks and others arguing her words were being intentionally misconstrued \u2014 we wrote a story to put her remarks in context.", "But there is no evidence that Omar has ever said al Qaeda is \u201cgreat\u201d or \u201cwonderful\u201d or that she could \u201chold my chest out\u201d when thinking of the terrorist group, as Trump claimed. To the contrary,\u00a0in the interview central to Trump\u2019s claim, she criticized al-Shabab, an al Qaeda affiliate, saying, its \u201cwhole ideology is based on terrorizing.\u201d Omar described the group as \u201cevil\u201d and \u201ctaking part in terror,\u201d and she explicitly said, \u201cI do not share that ideology.\u201d", "In his comments and in a tweet the following day, Trump cited low polling numbers for Omar and Ocasio-Cortez of 8% and 21%, respectively. But numbers similar to those are from a survey of white voters with no more than two years of college education, not voters overall or voters in the lawmakers\u2019 districts.", "In his July 15 comments, Trump said, \u201cOne of them is polling at 8%,\u201d and his July 16 tweet claimed, \u201cOmar is polling at 8%, Cortez at 21%.\u201d", "\u2026..Congresswomen, who I truly believe, based on their actions, hate our Country. Get a list of the HORRIBLE things they have said. Omar is polling at 8%, Cortez at 21%. Nancy Pelosi tried to push them away, but now they are forever wedded to the Democrat Party. See you in 2020!", "\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 16, 2019", "Axios published information about this poll on July 14, without naming the group that conducted it per an agreement with that group. The story said that a poll \u201cmaking the rounds of some of the most influential Democrats in America\u201d showed swing voters who had supported Trump in 2016 didn\u2019t have favorable views of Omar and Ocasio-Cortez. The poll of 1,003 white likely voters for the general election who also had no more than two years of college education showed 53% recognized Omar, with 9% having a favorable view of her, and 74% recognized Ocasio-Cortez, with 22% having a favorable view.", "We don\u2019t know whether those 1,003 voters were a nationwide sample or from certain states or regions. But it\u2019s worth noting that both lawmakers were quite popular with voters in their congressional districts, winning their seats in 2018 by large margins. Omar won Minnesota\u2019s 5th District and Ocasio-Cortez won New York\u2019s 14th District, each with 78% of the votes.", "A Siena College poll taken in late March and early April of 607 registered voters in Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s district found 52% had a favorable opinion of her, and her job approval rating was 47%. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 4.3 percentage points.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
