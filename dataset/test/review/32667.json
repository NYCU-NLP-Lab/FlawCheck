This manufacturing industry is a key part of the island\u2019s manufacturing base and is supported by a highly skilled workforce.", "Among the manufacturers affected was Baxter International, the largest IV bag supplier in the United States; the company says on its website that it ships more than a million units of IV solutions a day. The FDA responded by saying that Baxter and other companies to get priority access to the island territory's electrical grid.", "On 28 December 2017, the FDA sent us the following statement:", "The FDA has been working very closely with industry and local and federal officials to help address the shortage situation for IV saline and other products as a result of Hurricane Maria. This remains a key area of focus for the agency and we expect that the shortage of IV fluids will improve in early 2018 based on the information we are receiving from the manufacturers. In the meantime, we are continuing all of our efforts to increase supplies while concerns remain.", "Baxter sent us a statement confirming that all of its facilities in the territory are connected to the local electrical grid, with backup diesel generators on tap in case of power outages.

Baxter added:", "We are also bringing additional units to the U.S. market through a recent permanent approval from the FDA for IVs produced in one of our North American manufacturing plants. We expect to see this incremental supply benefitting current customers and providing us the opportunity to service other customers in the beginning of 2018.", "The FDA said in a follow-up statement released on 5 January 2018:", "FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said a key area of focus is addressing the I.V. saline shortage, which has affected patients, health care providers, and hospitals.

Although Puerto Rican authorities initially reported that around 50 people had been killed in the territory as a result of Maria, several accounts have surfaced contradicting that estimate. In early December 2017, Gov. Ricardo Rossell\u00f3 ordered a recount of the death toll.

At the time of his post, he said, he was unaware of the ongoing IV bag shortage:", "Obviously I knew about the hurricane; I lived in San Juan as a little kid and have been back to Puerto Rico many times. Both my parents worked their whole careers in health care and I knew that was part of the island but didn\u2019t know about the current situation until our excellent nurse told me. At the time he was giving my wife her pre-meds before her chemo infusion - steroids, stomach aids, saline flush, etc.", "He said of the attention his tweet received:", "Twitter is very weird in that it's very hard to tell how something blew up - I know it only had a couple of likes and comments for the first 5 or 6 hours and then clearly some big account RTd it - I wish I knew who it was! After that I started to see lots more RTs including several big names I recognized. As you can see from my account, I mostly tweet dumb jokes, but this was just such a wild thing and I hadn't heard it from anyone else so I thought it would be informative. Very soon after it started to spread I started seeing lots of nurses and medical professionals jumping on it and I realized that (a) it was a story most people didn\u2019t know about, and (b) it was clearly massively widespread and growing.", "Most of the people who have contacted him since his remark began spreading online, he said, have offered similar stories.", "Johnson, Linda A. \u00a0 \"Puerto Rico Hurricane May Cause Shortage of Hospital IV Bags.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 USA Today. \u00a0 13 October 2017.", "Goldberg, Kenny. \u00a0 \"San Diego Hospitals Grappling with Shortage of IV Bags.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 KPBS-TV. \u00a0 27 November 2017.", "Manganis, Julie. \u00a0 \"Hospitals Take Steps to Cope with IV Bag Shortage.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The Salem News. \u00a0 27 December 2017.", "Food and Drug Administration. \u00a0 \"FDA Analysis Reinforces the Important Role of Medical Product Manufacturing to Puerto Rico's Economic Vitality and the Island's Jobs Recovery.\"\r\n6 November 2017.", "Koons, Cynthia and Robert Langreth. \u00a0 \"Facing Saline Shortage, FDA Prioritizes Some Puerto Rico Plants.\"\r\nBloomberg. \u00a0 17 November 2017.", "Hern\u00e1ndez, Arelis R. \u00a0 \"Puerto Rico Governor Orders Recount of Hurricane Death Toll.\"\r\nThe Washington Post. \u00a0 18 December 2017.", "Food and Drug Administration.  \"FDA Issues Update on Recovery Efforts in Puerto Rico and Efforts to Mitigate I.V.
