The DSCC picked Cunningham over Erica Smith, Trevor Fuller and Atul Goel, who are all vying to face incumbent Republican Thom Tillis.", "The DSCC\u2019s decision didn\u2019t go over well with the Rev. William Barber, a liberal activist from North Carolina. Smith, who is black, along with Cunningham is considered a top primary competitor.", "\"Every time this has happened in the past & the person they didn\u2019t support was black, the candidate they picked ended up losing in the fall b/c Dems unnecessarily divided themselves in the primary,\" Barber tweeted on Feb. 20, adding that the DSCC should stay out of the primary.", "Is it true that every time the DSCC has endorsed a candidate in North Carolina\u2019s US Senate primary, and overlooked a black Democrat, the endorsed candidate went on to lose?", "Martha Waggoner, a spokeswoman for Barber, said Barber had one race in mind, back in 2002.", "That year, \"the Democratic establishment went outside its normal way of doing business and endorsed Erskine Bowles in a primary race that included Dan Blue,\" she said.", "Bowles beat Blue in the Democratic primary, then went on to lose to Republican Elizabeth Dole. Blue is now the minority leader in the state Senate.", "\"Since Blue was the only previous Democratic African American candidate for U.S. Senate here, his use of \u2018every time\u2019 was referring to this instance,\" she said.", "But the claims by Waggoner and Barber are both inaccurate.", "In recent years, several black candidates filed to run for Senate in North Carolina.

Jim Hunt and New York Sen. Charles Schumer, chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, after they had tried unsuccessfully to recruit state Rep. Grier Martin of Raleigh.", "DSCC spokesman Matt Miller told Politico in 2008 that his group \"worked hard to get Hagan; we really thought Dole was vulnerable,\" he said, adding: \"Hagan has turned out to be a great candidate, all under the D.C. radar.\"", "Campaign finance reports filed with the Federal Election Commission show the DSCC spent tens of thousands of dollars on Hagan\u2019s campaign prior to the May 6, 2008, primary.", "In North Carolina, several black candidates have run for U.S. Senate in recent years.

In the general election, Ross lost to incumbent Republican Richard Burr.", "In 2014, Hagan was the incumbent. Reeves ran against her in the primary and lost. Hagan went on to lose to Tillis.", "In 2010, there were three black candidates: Ken Lewis, Ann Worthy and the same Marcus Williams from 2008.
