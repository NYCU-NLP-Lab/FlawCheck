["By Lori Robertson, D'Angelo Gore, Robert Farley and Eugene Kiely", "Posted on January 7, 2021", "The process of certifying Joe Biden as the 46th president of the United States occurred in the early morning hours of Jan. 7, after being disrupted by rioters and delayed by Republicans who repeated false and misleading claims about the election results.", "Six Republican senators and more than 100 GOP House members objected to the election results in Arizona and Pennsylvania in a failed final attempt to keep President Donald Trump in office.", "Here we review some of the claims they made during the debate:", "During the floor debate on whether to accept Arizona\u2019s Electoral College votes, Gosar misleadingly said\u00a0\u201cwe have been told over and over\u201d by the Arizona secretary of state that \u201cthe public today has no ability to simply double check the veracity of these results.\u201d", "In fact, Arizona law requires \u201ca hand count of a sample of ballots to test the accuracy of the vote tabulation equipment, if there is participation from the county political parties,\u201d\u00a0according to\u00a0the Arizona secretary of state\u2019s office. Of the state\u2019s 15 counties, 10 performed hand counts; six found no discrepancies and four found errors within the acceptable margin. That included hand recounts in the\u00a0four largest counties\u00a0(Maricopa, Pima, Pinal and Yavapai) that represent 85% of the state\u2019s population.", "Gosar later said \u201cin the only audit done in Arizona\u201d a court found a \u201c3% error rate against President Trump. Vice President Biden\u2019s margin of error was one tenth of that, at .03%.\u201d He claimed that if that 3% error rate were applied statewide it would have been 90,000 ballots, but \u201cthe court stopped the audit and refused to go further.\u201d", "His claim of a 3% error rate is false, and his assumption of 90,000 additional Trump ballots is grossly exaggerated.", "Besides the hand recounts, the only \u201caudit\u201d conducted in Arizona was prompted by a lawsuit filed by\u00a0state Republican Party Chairwoman\u00a0Kelli Ward\u2019s lawsuit, and in that case the court found an error rate of 0.55% \u2014 not 3% \u2014 in Maricopa County.", "In her lawsuit, Ward\u00a0challenged\u00a0mail-in ballots that had been duplicated in the county because voters\u2019 first ballots \u201cwere too damaged or illegible for the tabulation machines to read, or were otherwise rejected by the machines.\u201d", "Her lawsuit led to a review of 100 duplicated ballots, followed by a second inspection of 1,526 duplicated ballots.", "\u201cOf the 1,626 total, there were nine errors, (1617 correct duplicate ballots) that if correct would have given the Trump Electors an additional seven votes and the Biden Electors an additional two votes,\u201d the state Supreme Court said in its\u00a0Dec. 8 ruling\u00a0denying Ward\u2019s request for an expanded audit. \u201cThe trial court concluded the results were \u201899.45% accurate.\u2019\u201d", "In filing an\u00a0appeal\u00a0to the U.S. Supreme Court, Ward noted that there was a 2% error rate against Trump in the first review of 100 ballots. The suit said one vote was \u201cerroneously \u2018flipped\u2019 from Trump to Biden, and the other [was] simply uncounted.\u201d That may be what Gosar meant when he spoke of a 3% error rate, but his office did not respond to our request for information.", "Even so, the error rate dropped to 0.55% when the county agreed to review more duplicated ballots.", "In its\u00a0opinion, the state Supreme Court said that extrapolating the 0.55% error rate to all 27,869 duplicated ballots in the county would result in a net increase of only 153 votes, which is not sufficient \u201cto call the election results into question.\u201d", "C. Murphy Hebert, a spokeswoman for the Arizona secretary of state, said she is \u201cnot aware of other \u2018audits\u2019\u201d in Arizona.", "Gosar also baselessly said that \u201cover 400,000 mail-in ballots [in Arizona] were altered, switched from President Trump to Vice President Biden or completely erased from President Trump\u2019s totals.\u201d But there is no evidence to support such a wild claim.", "As we mentioned earlier, the state conducted hand counts of sample ballots to make sure the machines are tabulating the ballots correctly. Under state law, representatives of both parties \u201crandomly pick either 2% or at least two vote centers or precinct, whichever is greater, to compare a manual count of ballots done by volunteers to the count completed by tabulation machines,\u201d as explained in a\u00a0story by ABC15\u00a0in Phoenix.", "In a Dec. 21\u00a0ruling, state Superior Court Judge John Hannah dismissed a state GOP lawsuit demanding that the state\u2019s largest county redo its hand count, noting\u00a0that the \u201chand counts verified that the machines had counted the votes flawlessly\u201d in Maricopa County, where about 61% of the state\u2019s population lives. Hannah called the lawsuit \u201cmeritless,\u201d saying it \u201coffered only suspicion of wrongdoing.\u201d", "And, as we noted earlier, a review of duplicated ballots in the county found an error rate of just 0.55% \u2014 which the state Supreme Court opinion said was not enough to affect the results. Biden\u00a0won\u00a0the state by less than 11,000 votes.", "Hebert, the spokesperson for the Arizona secretary of state, said she wasn\u2019t sure how Gosar arrived at his figure of 400,000 missing Trump votes.", "It\u2019s worth noting, though, that Gosar has made a similar claim with an even higher number. In a\u00a0Dec. 17 tweet, Gosar claimed: \u201cOver 700,000 votes stolen from @realDonaldTrump and given to Biden.\u201d Twitter labeled that tweet \u201cdisputed.\u201d Gosar linked to a\u00a0video\u00a0that baselessly claimed it provided evidence of \u201c790,175 laundered votes.\u201d", "But, as Arizona Republic columnist Laurie Roberts noted, \u201cIf Trump really got another 790,175 votes, that would mean he won a whopping 72% of Arizona\u2019s vote while Biden got a piddling 26%.\u201d", "Stefanik said, \u201cIn Pennsylvania, the state Supreme Court and secretary of state unilaterally and unconstitutionally rewrote election law, eliminating signature matching requirements.\u201d", "That\u2019s not so; the court unanimously ruled that the Pennsylvania Election Code never required signature matching for absentee or mail-in ballots in the first place.", "In an\u00a0Oct. 23 opinion, the court upheld\u00a0September guidance, issued by Pennsylvania Secretary of the Commonwealth Kathy Boockvar, saying that local election officials couldn\u2019t disqualify such ballots based solely on a signature analysis.", "\u201cWe conclude that the Election Code does not authorize or require county election boards to reject absentee or mail-in ballots during the canvassing process based on an analysis of a voter\u2019s signature,\u201d Justice Debra Todd wrote in the opinion, which was cosigned by five of the\u00a0other six justices. The other justice,\u00a0Sallie Updyke Mundy, one of\u00a0two Republicans\u00a0on the court, concurred in the ruling.", "It was the\u00a0second time\u00a0a court had rejected the Trump campaign\u2019s claims that, to prevent fraud, state law required efforts to check that signatures on returned ballots matched signatures on voter rolls.", "In its\u00a0analysis, the state Supreme Court noted that state election law \u201cenumerates only three duties of the county boards of elections during the pre-canvassing and canvassing process,\u201d none of which included a stipulation permitting or mandating signature matching.", "\u201cIntervenors would have us interpret the Election Code, which now does not provide for time-of-canvassing ballot challenges, and which never allowed for signature challenges, as both requiring signature comparisons at canvassing, and allowing for challenges on that basis. We reject this invitation,\u201d the court said.", "Stefanik also\u00a0claimed, \u201cIn Wisconsin, officials issued illegal rules to circumvent a state law \u2013 passed by the Legislature as the Constitution requires \u2013 that required absentee voters to provide photo identification before obtaining a ballot.\u201d", "That\u2019s misleading. The guidance was issued during the primary election \u2014 not the general \u2014 and it was quickly overruled by a state court. Wisconsin\u00a0state law\u00a0already says absentee voters don\u2019t have to provide a photo ID when requesting a ballot if the individual affirms that he or she is \u201cindefinitely confined because of age, physical illness or infirmity or is disabled for an indefinite period.\u201d", "It\u2019s true that on March 25, Dane County Clerk Scott McDonell and Milwaukee County Clerk George Christenson\u00a0advised\u00a0eligible Wisconsin voters that, for the April 7 primary elections, they could claim to be indefinitely confined because of state-issued stay-at-home orders due to the coronavirus pandemic. Doing so, the clerks said, would allow those people \u2014 stuck at home and unable to provide a photo ID \u2014 to skip that step in the ballot application process.", "But on March 29, the Wisconsin Elections Commission\u00a0issued\u00a0its own guidance, clarifying that, \u201cIndefinitely confined status shall not be used by electors simply as a means to avoid the photo ID requirement without regard to whether they are indefinitely confined because of age, physical illness, infirmity or disability.\u201d", "Then, in a\u00a0March 31 decision, the Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled that McDonell had given \u201clegally incorrect\u201d information to voters and ordered McDonell to \u201crefrain from posting advice\u201d that was \u201cinconsistent\u201d with the Wisconsin Elections Commission\u2019s own guidance.", "That also led to Christenson\u00a0issuing revised\u00a0guidance that month that said, \u201cIt is very important to note that \u2018indefinite confinement\u2019 based only upon the Governor\u2019s Safer at Home Emergency Order cannot be used to legally avoid the photo ID requirement.\u201d", "Presenting what he said were facts and evidence that courts circumvented state election laws, Zeldin cited this as one example: \u201cThe Democracy in the Park event in Wisconsin had over 17,000 ballots transferred that shouldn\u2019t have been.\u201d", "Zeldin added: \u201cThese are all facts.\u201d", "That\u2019s actually an opinion, and one not shared by the Wisconsin Supreme Court.", "Zeldin is referring to two events held in Madison, Wisconsin, one in September and one in October, called \u201cDemocracy in the Park\u201d in which people were allowed to bring completed absentee ballots to parks to be collected by sworn city election inspectors. The inspectors also could serve as witnesses if a voter brought an unsealed, blank ballot.", "In a lawsuit, the Trump campaign contended the 17,271 absentee ballots collected at these events amounted to illegal early in-person voting.", "The Wisconsin Supreme Court disagreed. Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Brian Hagedorn, a conservative, sided with three liberal justices in a 4-3 decision opposing the Trump campaign\u2019s efforts to strike those votes.", "In his written opinion for the majority, Hagedorn wrote that given the park events were all publicly announced, the time to contest them was before the election. The court stated it was \u201cpatently unreasonable\u201d for the campaign to file the lawsuit after the election, and for those votes to be thrown out given that \u201cthousands of voters relied on the representations of their election officials that these events complied with the law.\u201d", "Furthermore, Hagedorn stated, the events complied with Wisconsin election law, which requires voters to return absentee ballots by mail or \u201cin person, to the municipal clerk issuing the ballot or ballots.\u201d", "\u201cA sworn city election inspector sent by the clerk to collect ballots would seem to be an authorized representative as provided in the definition\u201d of the statute, Hagedorn wrote.", "People who brought completed absentee ballots to the parks had to have previously requested them. No absentee ballots or ballot applications were distributed at the events.", "Perry wrongly said the state Supreme Court had \u201cabsolutely no right\u201d to allow the use of unmanned drop boxes where voters could drop off mail-in votes. A federal judge appointed by Trump rejected a lawsuit from the Trump campaign that sought to prevent the use of drop boxes.", "Perry, Jan. 6: The Supreme Court authorized the use of drop boxes, where ballot harvesting could occur. The legislature never authorized that form of voting, and the court had absolutely no right to do so.", "In September, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that the state\u2019s election code permitted the use of drop boxes for submission of mail-in ballots. The court ruled that the competing interpretations of whether the state\u2019s election code allowed drop boxes were both reasonable, rendering the code \u201cambiguous.\u201d It ultimately determined that the law \u201cfavors the fundamental right to vote and enfranchises, rather than disenfranchises, the electorate\u201d and that \u201cthe Election Code should be interpreted to allow county boards of election to accept hand\u2013delivered mail\u2013in ballots at locations other than their office addresses including drop\u2013boxes.\u201d", "The following month a federal judge knocked down the Trump campaign\u2019s effort to bar the use of drop boxes.", "The opinion was written by U.S. District Judge J. Nicholas Ranjan, a Trump appointee.", "The Trump campaign argued that drop boxes would lead to the potential for the counting of \u201cfraudulent or otherwise ineligible ballots\u201d in the presidential election.", "But Ranjan said the Trump campaign had not presented enough evidence that potential voter fraud was a likely problem. \u201cWhile Plaintiffs may not need to prove actual voter fraud, they must at least prove that such fraud is \u2018certainly impending,'\u201d Ranjan wrote. \u201cThey haven\u2019t met that burden.\u201d", "In his comments on the House floor, Perry raised the specter of \u201cballot harvesting\u201d which refers to third parties collecting and delivering ballots, and which is not permitted in Pennsylvania. But no evidence has emerged to date that that was a problem at any drop boxes in the state.", "In objecting to Pennsylvania\u2019s electoral votes, Greene falsely claimed:\u00a0\u201cI\u2019d like to point out that all of the cases that have been thrown out have been thrown out on standing, not the evidence of voter fraud.\u201d Several of the Trump campaign\u2019s legal challenges have been dismissed by judges for a lack of any evidence of voter fraud.", "For example, in one case seeking to nullifying about 2,000 absentee ballots in Pennsylvania, Bucks County Court of Common Pleas Judge\u00a0Robert Baldi, a Republican,\u00a0wrote in\u00a0his order:\u00a0\u201cIt must be noted that the parties specifically stipulated in their comprehensive stipulation of facts that there exists no evidence of any fraud, misconduct, or any impropriety with respect to the challenged ballots. There is nothing in the record and nothing alleged that would lead to the conclusion that any of the challenged ballots were submitted by someone not qualified or entitled to vote in this election.\u201d", "In five other cases in Pennsylvania,\u00a0Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas Judge James Crumish\u00a0denied\u00a0the suits, writing in\u00a0each\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0five\u00a0orders that the campaign made \u201cmeritless\u201d arguments and \u201cconcedes that all ballots by a qualified elector in this category were\u00a0timely received.\u201d", "In yet another Pennsylvania case, Judge Stephanos Bibas, a\u00a0Trump appointee on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, wrote: \u201cFree, fair elections are the lifeblood of our democracy. Charges of unfairness are serious. But calling an election unfair does not make it so. Charges require specific allegations and then proof. We have neither here.\u201d The court had unanimously upheld a lower court\u2019s dismissal of the case.", "In late December, the New York Times analyzed 59 court losses the Trump campaign suffered among 60 lawsuits and found that most \u2014 two-thirds \u2014 didn\u2019t actually claim there had been voter fraud. About 12 cases that did allege fraud had \u201ctheir days in court,\u201d the Times wrote, \u201cand consistently collapsed under scrutiny.\u201d", "In dismissing a Nevada case, District Court Judge James T. Russell wrote in a lengthy dissection of the lawsuit\u2019s claims that the campaign \u201cdid not prove under any standard of proof that illegal votes were cast and counted.\u201d", "Some courts have dismissed cases because the plaintiffs lacked standing, meaning a right to sue. For instance, the U.S. Supreme Court cited standing in rejecting the state of Texas\u2019 attempt to sue four swing states Biden had won. But Greene is wrong to claim \u201call of the cases \u2026 have been thrown out on standing.\u201d", "Hawley prefaced an objection about a Pennsylvania voting law by saying it was \u201cquite apart from allegations of any fraud.\u201d Instead, Hawley misleadingly described an expansion of mail-in voting in the state, passed with Republican support in 2019.", "Hawley, Jan. 6: Last year, Pennsylvania elected officials passed a whole new law that allows universal mail-in balloting and did it irregardless of what the Pennsylvania Constitution said. \u2026 And then when Pennsylvania citizens tried to go and be heard on this subject before the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, they were dismissed on grounds of procedure, timeliness, in violation of that Supreme Court\u2019s own precedent.", "The state law in question, Act 77, was passed with bipartisan support and signed into law by Gov. Tom Wolf on Oct. 31, 2019. The law, which went into effect for the primary elections in 2020, expanded mail-in voting in the state, allowing for the first time no-excuse mail-in voting, which means registered voters can request a mail-in ballot without providing a reason for wanting or needing one. A total of 34 states plus Washington, D.C., allow no-excuse mail-in or absentee voting.", "Hawley is right that the state Supreme Court dismissed a case challenging the constitutionality of the law because the Republican plaintiffs, including U.S. Rep. Mike Kelly, had waited too long to bring the suit \u2014 but he neglected to mention they waited more than a year and only filed the suit after Trump had lost the election. In the suit, the plaintiffs had asked for the invalidation of mail-in ballots cast under the statute. In dismissing the case in late November, the court wrote that the plaintiffs showed a \u201ccomplete failure to act with due diligence in commencing their facial constitutional challenge, which was ascertainable upon Act 77\u2019s enactment.\u201d", "In a concurring statement, Justice David N. Wecht wrote: \u201cIt is not our role to lend legitimacy to such transparent and untimely efforts to subvert the will of Pennsylvania voters. Courts should not decide elections when the will of the voters is clear.\u201d", "The U.S. Supreme Court declined a request to intervene in the case.", "As for the Pennsylvania Constitution, it says: \u201cAll elections by the citizens shall be by ballot or by such other method as may be prescribed by law.\u201d Kelly\u2019s case argued that expanding mail-in voting in the state could only be done through a constitutional amendment, not legislation. It cited another section in the state Constitution on absentee voting, which says the Legislature \u201cshall, by general law, provide a manner\u201d for absentee voting for qualified voters who may be \u201cabsent from the municipality of their residence\u201d or who have other reasons they can\u2019t vote at their polling place, such as illness, disability or religious observances.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org does not accept advertising.
