["By Saranac Hale Spencer", "Posted on January 3, 2018", "Q: Did the U.S. Supreme Court uphold a law banning Muslims from serving in government?", "A: No. There is no such law. Two Muslims currently serve in the U.S. Congress.", "The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution guarantees the freedom of religion, and there is no federal law that would keep people of the Islamic faith from serving in public office.", "But a bogus story claiming that the Supreme Court has upheld a 1952 law that \u201cdisallowed Muslims from participating in American government\u201d has been shared on Facebook thousands of times. Users of the social media website flagged the story as potentially false.", "The fake story was originally published in early November on a website called America\u2019s Last Line of Defense, which describes itself as satirical and has a disclaimer that says, \u201cEverything on this website is fiction.\u201d That site has since taken down the story, but it already had been picked up and posted by more than a dozen other sites that have no such disclaimer.", "None of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent opinions have anything to do with religious law, and the story never names the law that it claims the Supreme Court upheld. It also says that the court will hear \u201cthe full case\u201d in 2018, but there is no such case on the court\u2019s calendar.", "The story also claims that one U.S. senator, one governor, and two congressmen have been Muslim. Only the latter part is true.", "Democratic Reps. Keith Ellison of Minnesota and Andre Carson of Indiana are Muslim. However, the Senate Historical Office told us that no Muslim has ever served in the Senate. Nor has a Muslim served as governor of a state.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to help identify and label viral\u00a0fake news\u00a0stories flagged by readers on the social media network.", "\u201cThe Bill of Rights: A Transcription.\u201d National Archives.
