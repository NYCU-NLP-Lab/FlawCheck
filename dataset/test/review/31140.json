["About this rating", "Certain national socialist, white nationalist and Nazi Twitter profiles are \"withheld\" from view when viewed by a Twitter user whose country is set to Germany.", "The change in settings is not entirely effective, and some Nazi-related accounts and content will persist.", "It's not clear how exactly Twitter chooses which accounts and which tweets to withhold in certain countries, though it is informed by local laws. In Germany, laws around hate speech are relatively strict.", "Some Twitter users, dismayed by the prevalence of far-right, white supremacist and neo-Nazi tweets and accounts on the platform, have figured out a way to avoid being exposed to such content.", "In December 2017, podcaster and journalist Virginia Heffernan passed on the trick to her followers, in a tweet that was shared almost 10,000 times within two days.", "PSA. For anyone beset by Nazi and brownshirt bots: I changed my Twitter address to Germany at the suggestion of a shrewd friend, and they vanished.

You must change your content settings.", "As an illustration, we browsed profiles that came up after we searched \"national socialist.\" With our country set to the United States, these were the top 12 profiles that showed up.", "As you can see, the algorithms are not perfect.

When we changed our country to Germany, five of them were blocked. This is what that looks like, using the example of the American Nazi Party:", "As that message suggests, Nazi and white nationalist accounts are also blocked for users in France. We changed our country to France, and two of the 10 accounts that we highlighted above were blocked.", "When we switched our country to the United Kingdom, just one was blocked (@national_action).", "Virginia Heffernan is right to allude the role of Germany's strict hate speech laws\u00a0 in the blocking of Nazi Twitter accounts.", "For historical reasons associated with the experience of World War II, some European countries \u2014 Germany and France, in particular \u2014 have relatively strict laws around hate speech and incitement to hatred, especially speech emanating from the far-right and neo-Nazi elements.", "For example, Holocaust denial or minimization is a criminal offense in more than a dozen countries, most of them European.
