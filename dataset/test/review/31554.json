["By Eugene Kiely and Lori Robertson", "Posted on September 5, 2019 | Updated on September 9, 2019 | Corrected on September 9, 2019", "President Donald Trump inaccurately stated in his Sept. 1 tweet that Alabama \u201cwill most likely be hit\u201d by Hurricane Dorian \u2014 a statement that was fact-checked in real time by the National Weather Service. Despite that, Trump has now twisted the facts by using an altered forecast map to support his inaccurate tweet and has looked for an apology from the \u201cFake News.\u201d", "This bizarre series of events started with a Sept. 1 tweet that included Alabama among the Southern states that \u201cwill most likely be hit\u201d by Hurricane Dorian, which devastated the Bahamas and is making its way up the coast of the Carolinas.", "In addition to Florida \u2013 South Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama, will most likely be hit (much) harder than anticipated. Looking like one of the largest hurricanes ever. Already category 5. BE CAREFUL! GOD BLESS EVERYONE!", "\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 1, 2019", "Trump\u2019s tweet came at 10:51 a.m., and the Birmingham office of the National Weather Service corrected the president 20 minutes later, saying, \u201cAlabama will NOT see any impacts from #Dorian.\u201d", "Alabama will NOT see any impacts from #Dorian. We repeat, no impacts from Hurricane #Dorian will be felt across Alabama. The system will remain too far east. #alwx", "\u2014 NWS Birmingham (@NWSBirmingham) September 1, 2019", "That should have been the end of it, but Trump refused to simply admit his mistake.", "The president has repeatedly defended the incorrect forecast for Alabama in a series of tweets and comments over the past several days, while disparaging the \u201cFake News\u201d media for accurately reporting that he was wrong. He has even suggested the media owes him\u00a0an apology.", "On Sept. 2, Trump tweeted \u201cin fact, under certain original scenarios, it was in fact correct that Alabama could have received some \u2018hurt,'\u201d accusing the media of \u201cdemeaning and belittling\u201d him.", "To support this claim, the president at the White House on Sept. 4 held up a map of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration advisory #021, dated Aug. 29 at 11 a.m. AST, that had been altered by someone in the Trump administration with a black Sharpie.", "The original NOAA map, which we display below, can be found on the NOAA National Hurricane Center website by using the \u201cselect advisory\u201d drop-down menu to find \u201cAdvisory #021.\u201d It clearly shows that the five-day track forecast cone, which represents \u201cthe probable path of the center\u201d of the storm, does not reach Alabama.", "Here is an image of the altered map that Trump showed to reporters on Sept. 4 at the White House.", "Trump\u2019s map was changed using a black marker to show the cone extending beyond Florida and reaching Alabama. The black extension past Florida did not exist on the original map, but it supported his Sept. 5 tweet that \u201cone model\u201d showed that Alabama \u201cwould have been hit or grazed\u201d before the hurricane changed course and moved further east.", "The original map, without the black marker expanding the cone, also was issued three full days before Trump tweeted that Alabama \u201cwill most likely be hit\u201d by Hurricane Dorian. As of Aug. 29 at 11 a.m., NOAA was forecasting that there was only a 5% to 20% chance that the southeast section of Alabama would see tropical storm force winds, which are sustained winds of 39 to 73 miles per hour.", "Here\u2019s the NOAA advisory #021 with an overlay of the projected wind speed that shows the potential impact on Alabama. The dark green ban is a 5%-10% chance of tropical storm force winds, and the lighter green next to it is a 10%-20% chance.", "We did not receive a comment from the White House, but Trump may have conflated the path of the hurricane with the areas estimated to experience tropical storm force winds.", "Subsequent NOAA advisories on Aug. 30 briefly showed the five-day track forecast cone \u2014 the path of the hurricane \u2014 clipping a small piece of Alabama, but the forecast cone was about 150 miles away from the state by the time Trump tweeted his warning on Sept. 1:", "Friday, Aug. 30, 11 a.m., advisory #025: A sliver of Alabama is shown with a 20%-30% chance of tropical storm force winds. The state remains outside the track forecast cone.", "Friday, Aug. 30, 5 p.m., advisory #026: The track forecast cone just clips the southeast corner of Alabama.", "Friday, Aug. 30, 11 p.m., advisory #027: Nearly all of that southeast corner is back out of the track forecast cone. Some parts still have a 5%-20% chance of tropical storm force winds.", "Saturday, Aug. 31, 5 a.m., advisory #028:\u00a0All of Alabama is outside the track forecast cone for Hurricane Dorian, which is projected to travel up along the eastern coast of Florida. There\u2019s still a small chance of tropical storm force winds, but the area potentially affected begins to shrink in forecasts throughout the day,\u00a0as the storm is projected to head east after traveling up Florida\u2019s coast.", "Sunday, Sept. 1, 8 a.m., advisory #032A: This is the latest public advisory before Trump warned Alabama would \u201cmost likely\u201d be one of the states \u201chit (much) harder than anticipated\u201d by the hurricane, but the advisory shows just a sliver of the state with a 5%-10% chance of tropical storm force winds. The edge of the track cone at that point is about 150 miles away from Alabama.", "Here\u2019s that advisory, issued nearly three hours before Trump tweeted about Alabama:", "When asked about the altered map he had presented, Trump claimed there had been \u201ca 95 percent chance probability\u201d that Alabama was going to be hit in the \u201coriginal forecast.\u201d That\u2019s not at all what NOAA\u2019s National Hurricane Center advisories showed.", "Trump, Sept. 4:\u00a0I know that Alabama was in the original forecast. They thought it was get it \u2014 as a piece of it. It was supposed to go \u2014 actually, we have a better map than that, which is going to be presented, where we had many lines going directly \u2014 many models \u2014 each line being a model. And they were going directly through. And, in all cases, Alabama was hit \u2014 if not lightly, in some cases pretty hard. Georgia, Alabama \u2014 it was a different route. They actually gave that a 95 percent chance probability.", "It turned out that that was not what happened; it made the right turn up the coast. But Alabama was hit very hard, and was going to be hit very hard, along with Georgia. But under the current, they won\u2019t be.", "The president later tweeted an Aug. 28 map from the South Florida Water Management District. That was four days before Trump\u2019s comments on Alabama, and it doesn\u2019t show a \u201c95% chance probability\u201d of the storm hitting Alabama. The spaghetti plot of many different models shows most forecasting the storm traveling up through or off the coast of Florida and then heading east. The SFWMD map also cautions: \u201cThese spaghetti plots are intended for use by individuals with proper training and expertise.\u201d", "The map further warns that National Hurricane Center advisories should \u201csupersede this product,\u201d and, \u201cIf anything on this graphic causes confusion, ignore the entire product.\u201d", "Trump gave outdated and inaccurate information about Alabama when he sent his tweet at 10:51 a.m. on Sept. 1. That\u2019s a fact. The Birmingham office of the National Weather Service made that clear just 20 minutes later in its own tweet correcting Trump.", "Instead of accepting that, the president has doubled down on his mistake \u2014 going so far as to publicly present a doctored forecast map \u2014 and falsely accused the media of inaccurately reporting the facts.", "Update, Sept. 7: NOAA issued a\u00a0statement on Sept. 6 that said, \u201cThe Birmingham National Weather Service\u2019s Sunday morning tweet spoke in absolute terms that were inconsistent with probabilities from the best forecast products available at the time.\u201d The statement cited hurricane advisories 15 through 41, issued from Aug. 28 to Sept. 2, that confirmed what we reported: There was a small chance of tropical storm force winds in a small portion of Alabama at the time of the Sept. 1 tweets by the president and the Birmingham National Weather Service.", "Correction, Sept. 9: The NOAA legend for the probability of sustained winds shows a range of percentages. We initially misread that legend, and we have corrected the story accordingly.", "Update, Sept. 9: Louis Uccellini, the director of the National Weather Service, spoke during the National Weather Association\u2019s annual meeting in Huntsville, Alabama, on Sept. 9 about the Birmingham NWS office\u2019s Sept. 1 tweet. \u201cThey did what any office would do \u2014 with an emphasis they deemed essential to shut down what they thought were rumors,\u201d Uccellini said. \u201cThey quickly acted to reassure partners, the media and the public with strong language that there was no threat from tropical storm affecting the state and local communities at that time. And they did that based on past experiences to ensure clarity and impact. They did that with one thing in mind: public safety. And they responded not knowing where this information was coming from. Only later when the retweets and the politically based comments came into their office did they learn the sources of this information. Nevertheless, they were correct in clarifying that the threat was very low. \u2026", "\u201cSo, let me be clear: The Birmingham office did this to stop public panic, to ensure public safety, the same goal as all the National Weather Service offices were working toward at that time.\u201d", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
