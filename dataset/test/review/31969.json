["About this rating", "As Winter Storm\u00a0Jonas bore down on the northeast in January 2016, a photograph\u00a0purportedly showing a JetBlue airliner buried in snow went viral on social media. This image was viewed by thousands of social media users after it was posted to the Facebook page of Tri-State Weather on 23 January 2016, and tweet from ESPN reporter Darren Rovell featuring the image was also widely shared:", "Rovell's tweet, as well as several other subsequent messages, pointed to Dan Linden, global head of social media for ABC News, and Don Uselmann, general manager of airport operations of John F. Kennedy International Airport, as the source of the photograph. The original message, however, has been deleted:", "While this photograph is \"real\" in the sense that it did not undergo significant digitial editing, it does not show a JetBlue airliner covered in a massive snow drift \u2014 instead, it uses forced perspective\u00a0in order to make it seem as if the plane were covered in snow. The photographer likely took the picture from behind a small pile of snow that hid\u00a0the body of the plane, as shown in an illustration by\nCTV News Toronto's aviation photographer Tom Podolec:", "JetBlue has not commented on this viral image, but they did share another photograph of one of their planes on the runway:", "Although we prefer to keep our planes in the air, Jonas is being pretty stubborn about keeping us on the ground. #Blizzard2016", "John F. Kennedy International Airport did record its snowiest single day total during\u00a0the Winter Storm\u00a0Jonas, and JetBlue did cancel several flights due to the wintry conditions,\u00a0but the photograph showing a JetBlue airliner buried in snow is the result of photographic legerdemain and not a massive snowdrift.", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
