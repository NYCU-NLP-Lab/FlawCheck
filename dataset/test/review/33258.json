However, the president can issue an executive order to give federal workers the day off. Following similar announcements in 2018 and 2019, the 2020 move marked the third time Trump has opted to designate Christmas Eve as a federal holiday.", "Trump isn\u2019t the first president to issue a day off on the days before or after the Christmas Day holiday. He joined Franklin Roosevelt as one of two sitting presidents to relieve a full eight-hour workday.", "The following presidents issued four-hours of time off on Christmas Eve:", "Obama also issued an executive order granting Dec. 26, 2014, as a federal holiday.", "This designation may or may not extend to employees in the private sector.
