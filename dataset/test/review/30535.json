["By Sydney Schaedel", "Posted on October 12, 2020", "Uganda has had relatively low numbers of COVID-19 cases and deaths \u2014 but not because of hydroxychloroquine, as an article on social media claims. Uganda\u2019s guidelines initially included the use of the drug as an experimental medication, but studies showed it made no difference. Instead, the country implemented a strict lockdown and mask mandate that has limited the virus\u2019 spread.", "Hydroxychloroquine has been touted by some \u2014 including\u00a0President Donald Trump \u2014 as a treatment for COVID-19.

Malaria is common in Africa. In 2012, Uganda had the 6th highest annual deaths from malaria in Africa. Hydroxychloroquine is a drug used to treat or prevent malaria.\u201d", "Related text posts claim, \u201cUganda (43,000,000 people), where Hydroxychloroquine is eaten like candy due to malaria, have had 13 Covid deaths.\u201d", "The source of the viral social media article, palmerfoundation.com.au, is the website of The Palmer Foundation, a \u201cphilanthropic entity owned by the Palmer family, headed by Clive Palmer,\u201d according to the site.\u00a0 Clive Palmer is an Australian businessman and politician who made headlines when he announced in April that he had purchased 30 million doses of hydroxychloroquine, which he donated to Australia\u2019s National Medical Stockpile.

So in our second guideline, we have removed it from therapy,\u201d Worodria said.", "The second edition of Uganda\u2019s national guidelines, which were issued in June, said \u201cChloroquine or Hydroxychloroquine is no longer recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 patients.\u201d", "So the nation\u2019s low COVID-19 numbers have not been due to widespread use of hydroxychloroquine, but through other measures taken by the Ugandan government.", "Reuters reported\u00a0that Uganda closed schools and banned large gatherings three days before confirming its first COVID-19 case in March.", "By the end of that month, most of the country\u2019s businesses were shut down, vehicle movement was banned, and the government implemented an overnight curfew.\u00a0 Passengers were screened at airports, and infected individuals were hospitalized in isolation wards.", "The government also enacted a face mask mandate and had distributed more than 13 million masks to the public by May.", "Public health experts told Reuters that Uganda had learned from experience battling other infectious diseases like Ebola and Marburg virus.", "Uganda has announced the easing of some restrictions, but the country\u2019s schools remain closed.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
