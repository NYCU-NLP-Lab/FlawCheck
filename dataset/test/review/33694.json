We\u2019ll show it to you now if you need it. We\u2019ll give you the details. But hundreds and hundreds of labs are ready, willing, and able.\"", "Is there a vast, untapped reservoir of labs at the states\u2019 disposal?", "Not in the way Trump described it. Many labs exist, but it\u2019s not yet clear they have the capacity and equipment needed to do the job.", "We asked the White House for the data to back up Trump\u2019s assertion about hundreds of labs, but the press office declined to comment and did not provide the list Trump referenced. A spokesperson for the Health and Human Services Department said it couldn\u2019t provide a tally of these untapped labs.", "The spokesperson there did point to the Food and Drug Administration, which lists 109 labs nationwide that are already offering COVID-19 testing. The FDA also has a separate list of labs that are processing tests under emergency authorization. That adds 18 for a total of 127.", "But Trump was describing labs that could conduct tests, not ones that already were.", "White House press staff provided an image of a map that included any lab that had equipment for identifying the genetic sequence of a virus.

Each lab has testing equipment designed to meet those particular needs. Testing experts say it\u2019s unrealistic to expect that each of these labs is able to analyze any specimen it receives.", "\"Just because the machine exists, you can't will it to work,\" said Scott Becker,\u00a0 Association of Public Health Laboratories chief executive officer. \"You can\u2019t just show up with a sample, plug it in and expect it to work.\"", "Louise Serio, spokeswoman for the American Clinical Laboratory Association, a trade group that includes the largest commercial labs, echoed the point that much depends on the kind of equipment \u2014 or \"platform\" \u2014 the lab has.", "Test kits vary. They can contain different materials for a different range of steps in the process, and some are more complete than others. They are not interchangeable.", "\"For a lab to run a manufacturer\u2019s test kit on a platform, the materials have to match up \u2014 the test kit and the platform must be from the same manufacturer,\" Serio said.", "Part of the challenge of using any lab is that testing is a three-step process.", "It starts by collecting the specimen with a swab, preserving it in a stable medium for transport, and doing all the data entry that clearly ties that particular specimen to the patient it came from.", "At the lab, the RNA from the specimen is extracted and amplified so that it can be identified in a testing machine.", "Then the results are reviewed and shared with health care providers and public health departments.", "The first two steps are vulnerable to supply shortages \u2014 especially of the nasal swabs used to collect patient samples and the chemicals referred to as \"reagents\" that are needed to study them.
