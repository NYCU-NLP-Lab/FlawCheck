["\u201cThe United States Department of State has issued a statement denouncing the TPLF as a terrorist in East Africa (sic),\u201d claims a Facebook post in Amharic shared more than 3,000 times since November 20, 2020. \u201cThis is a big headache for the TPLF. Going forward, the world will intensify its monitoring on this terrorist group.\u201d", "The post includes images of US Secretary of State Michael Pompeo\u00a0and TPLF frontmen Debretsion Gebremichael and Seyoum Mesfin.", "Fighting in Ethiopia\u2019s northern Tigray region, rooted in long-running tensions between local leaders and authorities in the capital Addis Ababa, flared when Tigray held its own elections in September, defying a nationwide ban on polls because of the coronavirus pandemic.", "Tensions escalated dramatically when Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed ordered his military into Tigray last month after he said the TPLF launched a bloody attack on a federal army camp. The TPLF has denied this.", "The conflict has claimed thousands of lives and forced tens of thousands of refugees across the border into Sudan.", "The US has repeatedly expressed concerns about the ongoing conflict in Ethiopia.", "On November 17, 2020, Pompeo said in a statement that the US \u201cstrongly condemns\u201d recent TPLF attacks, including rocket strikes last month which appeared to target an airport in neighbouring Eritrea, accused by Tigray of backing Ethiopia.", "We strongly condemn the attack by the Tigray People\u2019s Liberation Front against Eritrea and the attempt to internationalize the conflict. We urge the TPLF and the Ethiopian authorities to take immediate steps to de-escalate the conflict, restore peace, and protect civilians.", "While the US Department of State has issued various statements on the crisis (including here and here), it has not publicly declared the TPLF a \u201cterrorist organization\u201d.", "Furthermore, the TPLF does not feature on the Department of State\u2019s list of \u201cdesignated foreign terrorist organizations\u201d.", "However, the TPLF was deemed by the US to be a \u201cTier III terrorist organization\u201d until 1991, the year that it toppled autocrat Mengistu Hailemariam and became part of the ruling coalition of Ethiopia, according to a statement from\u00a0the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) sent to AFP Fact Check.", "As opposed to Tier I and Tier II Terrorist Organizations which undergo a formal designation process, groups in Tier III are known as \u201cundesignated terrorist organizations\u201d. They involve \u201ca group of two or more individuals, whether organized or not, which engages in, or has a subgroup which engages in terrorist activity\u201d.", "However, since the US definition of \u201cterrorism-related activity\u201d is broad -- typically including rebel groups fighting against an authoritarian regime -- some organisations, such as the TPLF, are exempt from immigration restrictions usually imposed on members of such groups.", "In 2014, the US said that people who were involved with the TPLF after May 1991, when it was no longer classed as a Tier III Terrorist Organization, may not require this special exemption.", "\u201cImplementation of the TPLF exemption is to be examined by USCIS on a case by case basis under the totality of the circumstances,\u201d it said.", "AFP Fact Check has debunked more false information around the Tigray crisis here.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
