The photograph that the site claimed was a 2016 picture depicting an infant in Ukraine suffering from a coxsackievirus infection had actually been posted online several years earlier, in a 2009 blog entry about the use of steroids in treating children with Kawasaki\u2019s disease. That picture obviously wasn't taken in 2016, and the blog post in which it appeared made no reference to Ukraine or coxsackievirus:", "Moreover, the CBS News report did not in any way make deceptive use of this image by wrongly presenting it as a picture of a child being treated in New York City in 2020, as Gateway Pundit falsely suggested. The report simply used the photograph as a visual example of what Kawasaki symptoms look like by briefly displaying it while the narrator mentioned that the unknown illness currently \"putting otherwise healthy children in the hospital\" in New York City during the COVID-19 pandemic \"resembles Kawasaki disease\":", "https://youtu.be/x-ezWRYYF6c?t=1m4s\n\nIt appears that, with their usual disregard for journalistic standards, Gateway Pundit relied upon an unverified third-party tweet to issue a baseless accusation, without making any attempt whatsoever to verify the content of that tweet or the source(s) on which it was based.", "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \u00a0 \"Kawasaki Disease.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Accessed 25 May 2020.", "Hoecker, Jay L., M.D. \u00a0 \"Coxsackievirus in Children: How serious Is It?\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Mayo Clinic. \u00a0 19 July 2017.", "LaPook, Jon. \u00a0 \"Kids Hospitalized with Mystery Illness Possibly Tied to COVID-19.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 CBS Evening News. \u00a0 5 May 2020.", "i steroids. \u00a0 \"Children with Kawasaki's Disease Can Benefit from Steroids.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 23 November 2009.", "Hoft, Jim. \u00a0 \"CBS Caught Using Photo from Ukraine in 2016 in Their \u2018Panic Porn\u2019 on Coronavirus in Children.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Gateway Pundit. \u00a0 24 May 2020.", "David Mikkelson founded the site now known as snopes.com back in 1994.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
