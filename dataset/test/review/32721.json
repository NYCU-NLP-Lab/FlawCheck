And now the Wisconsin Democratic Party is making an attack -- though with a claim that doesn\u2019t go nearly as far as the lie of the year.", "In a radio ad released May 4, 2016, the party said GOP U.S. Sen.

Medicare would have changed from a program that pays doctors and hospitals fees for particular services to one in which beneficiaries would be paid an amount by the government that they could use toward private insurance premiums. It would have affected people who at the time were under 55.", "Ryan then updated versions of the plan, including one as part of his fiscal year 2013 budget proposal. That newer version would have allowed beneficiaries under 55 a choice -- they could use their payment to buy private insurance or for a plan that acts like traditional Medicare.", "So, the main point is that Medicare would change from paying fees to doctors and hospitals, and instead beneficiaries would get a fixed subsidy toward their coverage.", "That\u2019s a big change.", "Johnson\u2019s campaign argues that the change wouldn\u2019t be a voucher and emphasizes that what Republicans\u00a0call\u00a0premium support payments would be made to insurance companies, not to Medicare beneficiaries themselves.", "Our colleagues concluded that, although there are technical differences between voucher and premium supports that may matter to health policy professionals, the two definitions have become almost indistinguishable and voucher program is a fair description for what Ryan proposed.", "Our rating", "The state Democratic Party says Johnson voted to turn Medicare \"into a voucher program.\"", "To some health policy experts, there are technical differences between voucher and premium supports -- the latter term being preferred by Johnson and other Republicans when it comes to Medicare changes.", "But under Ryan\u2019s proposals, Medicare would no longer pay fees to health care providers -- instead, Medicare beneficiaries would get a fixed subsidy to use toward their health care.", "We rate the statement Mostly True.", "Wisconsin Democratic Party, radio ad, May 4, 2016", "Email, Wisconsin Democratic Party spokesman Harry Hartfield, June 6, 2016", "Interview, Ron Johnson campaign spokesman Will Allison, June 7, 2016", "PolitiFact National, \"Do Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan want to turn Medicare into a voucher program?
