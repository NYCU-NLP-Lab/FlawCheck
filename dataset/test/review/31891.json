She can be seen holding a sign which states: \u201cbottled water companies don\u2019t produce water, they produce plastic bottles\u201d.", "Text at the bottom of the graphic reads: \u201cJudith Collins knows this because Collin\u2019s husband is a director of Oravida, a Chinese based water bottling company that produces millions of plastic bottles here in New Zealand. Why do you think that Collins wants the R.M.Act gone?\u201d", "Judith Collins is the leader of the New Zealand National Party.", "Oravida is actually a New Zealand-based company that exports water and dairy products to China.", "\u201cR.M.Act\u201d refers to the Resource Amendment Management Act (2020). Collins said she would repeal the act and replace it with two new pieces of law -\u00a0Environment Standards Act and the Urban Planning and Development Act - if she wins in this October\u2019s election, the New Zealand Herald reported on July 17, 2020.", "The graphic has been shared hundreds of times in other Facebook posts, including\u00a0here, here, here, here and here.", "The claim, however, lacks important context.", "Collins\u2019 husband David Wong-Tung was previously a director of Oravida, but as of October 2020, he no longer holds the position, according to filings on the New Zealand Companies Register website.", "Oravida is listed as having one major shareholder, Kauri NZ Investment Limited.
