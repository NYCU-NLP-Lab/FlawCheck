["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "When a 4.0 earthquake likely caused by fracking waste injected into a fault line occurred in Youngstown on New Year's Eve, one of the residents whose home was shaken by the quake was state Rep. Robert Hagan.\n\nThe veteran Democratic lawmaker from Youngstown has a well-earned reputation for being outspoken so it's no surprise that Hagan has taken the lead in calling for a moratorium on injecting waste deep into the ground and asking pointed questions about the incident..\n\nAt a Jan. 10 statehouse protest to support the moratorium on waste disposal wells, Hagan told the crowd that the earthquake had raised a number of questions including why Gov. John Kasich's administration did not react more quickly to 10 smaller earthquakes which had struck the Youngstown area in the 10 months preceding the New Year\u2019s Eve shake-up.\n\nThe Democratic lawmaker even seemed to lay the blame for the quake at the feet of Kasich.\n\n\"We never had an earthquake in Youngstown until John Kasich was elected Governor,\" Hagan said.\n\nHagan's claim shook up the sensors at the Politifact Ohio monitoring center. Was Youngstown really earthquake-free until John Kasich became the state's chief executive on Jan. 10, 2011?\n\nWe contacted Hagan who said he consulted a map of earthquakes in Ohio produced by the Ohio Department of Natural Resources before he made his comment. \"Sure, there's been some minor seismic activity, but earthquakes -- which is a 2.0 (on the Richter Scale) or better -- haven't happened until the past year,\" Hagan said. \"That's what ODNR's own map shows.\"\n\nWe checked with ODNR and the state's seismic monitoring system -- which has only been in place since about 1999 hasn't detected any earthquakes in the Youngstown area prior to March 2011. \"We have not recorded a significantly felt seismic event in Youngstown since the networks were put in place about 1999,\" said Ohio Department of Natural Resources spokesman Carlo LoParo.\n\nPrior to the monitoring equipment being in place, ODNR\u2019s record of historical earthquakes in Ohio relies on other monitoring systems such as those done by the U.S. Geological Survey and accounts from newspaper reports. And those don't show any earthquakes in Youngstown.\n\nHowever, LoParo said there have been other earthquakes nearby that were felt in Youngstown. \"There have been some significant earthquakes in Ashtabula, Summit County and Mercer County, Pennsylvania that were felt across northeast Ohio and in Youngstown,\" LoParo said.\n\nYoungstown State professor Jeffrey Dick, the chair of the school\u2019s Geological and Environmental Sciences Department, also confirmed that Youngstown itself has been a quiet zone seismically before the recent series of earthquakes thought to be linked to the injection well.\n\n\"Earthquakes in this part of Ohio are pretty uncommon,\" he said. \"The reason is that underneath the ground in this part of the state is what's known as the Grenville Province -- it's a body of rock that is sometimes known as the Precambrian basement rock of Ohio. And it doesn't have major structural features that would cause earthquakes.\" Dick said he wasn't aware of any earthquakes centered in Youngstown prior to the recent series linked to the injection well.\n\nHe said most earthquakes in Ohio run along major fault lines, such as one running under eastern Lake Erie waters or another in western Ohio centered around Shelby County, not far from the Indiana border.\n\nIndeed, it looks like Hagan is right that earthquakes haven't come to Youngstown before March 2011 when Kasich was governor.\n\nBut regardless of the timing of the quakes, Hagan makes a rhetorical stretch to imply that the earthquake happened because Kasich was governor.\n\nThe injection wells are not something that Kasich is the first governor to allow -- they have been around for several decades. And Kasich did not weaken regulations on drilling regulations or do anything that could be construed as making it more likely the earthquake would happen.\n\nIn fact, state regulators have said the company that owns the Youngstown well -- D&L Energy -- was not violating its permit by injecting too much waste or injecting it too quickly into the ground.\n\nSo let\u2019s drill down to the core here:", "Earthquakes linked to injection wells are relatively rare occurrences, so it seems that the Kasich administration is probably more unlucky than anything to be in charge when it happened.\n\nWe\u2019ll give Hagan a point for his geologic accuracy, but he can\u2019t shake the fact that Kasich isn\u2019t the cause of the quakes.\n\nOn the Truth-O-Meter, we rate his claim Half True.", "Cleveland Scene, \"Anti-frackers rally at the Ohio statehouse,\" Jan. 10, 2012\n\nPhone Interview with Carlo LoParo, spokesman for the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Jan. 17 and Jan 19, 2012\n\nPhone Interviews with State Rep.
