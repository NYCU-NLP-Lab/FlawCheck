That changes this rating\u00a0to True.", "To President Donald Trump, the number of illegal border crossings at the southern border has become so great that he declared the situation a national emergency.", "But just how much traffic is flowing from Mexico to the United States?", "According to U.S. Sen.

The totals do not include immigrants who are turned away when seeking asylum or other lawful admission to the U.S.", "When we contacted Johnson\u2019s office, spokesman Ben Voelkel said Johnson\u2019s reference to 23,000 crossings came from Border Patrol apprehension data.

But a news release from Johnson\u2019s office used the \"or as unaccompanied children\" phrasing.", "Regardless, Johnson\u2019s statement referenced illegal crossings in general, not from specific countries.
