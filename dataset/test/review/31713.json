["By Lori Robertson", "Posted on January 8, 2019", "U.S. Border Patrol encountered 6,259 immigrants with criminal convictions, many of them for illegal entry charges, in fiscal 2018, according to the most recent statistics. Yet, White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney misleadingly claimed authorities \u201chad arrested 17,000 criminals at the southern border.\u201d", "President Donald Trump, too, included this figure in a letter he sent to Congress on Jan. 4, saying \u201c17,000 adults at the border with existing criminal records were arrested\u201d last fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30. The White House, and Mulvaney, used the figure to argue for the necessity of a border wall. But the figure includes more than 10,000 people who were stopped while trying to lawfully enter the country at legal ports of entry throughout the U.S.,\u00a0according to statistics from U.S. Customs and Border Protection.", "Mulvaney made his claim on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d on Jan. 6, saying it was \u201cfrustrating\u201d that the administration and Democrats in Congress \u201ccan\u2019t even agree on the basic facts.\u201d But\u00a0the administration is spinning these numbers.", "Mulvaney, CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union,\u201d Jan. 6:\u00a0One of the most frustrating things, Jake, about the meeting that we had yesterday was that we can\u2019t even agree on the basic facts. The DHS, Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen tried to point out that we had arrested 17,000 criminals at the southern border so far \u2014 well, actually, just last year \u2014 and Nancy Pelosi simply refused to accept that fact.", "She said, those are your facts, and trying to make the point there are not your facts and my facts. There are just facts. If you can\u2019t even have a basic understanding of the facts, it\u2019s going to be very difficult to come to an agreement.", "Here are the facts, according to Customs and Border Protection, through Aug. 31, 2018, one month shy of the full 2018 fiscal year:", "CBP statistics don\u2019t include a breakdown of the convictions of individuals stopped by the Office of Field Operations at ports of entry, nor is there a breakdown for how many people were encountered along the Southwest border. However, every year thousands are turned away\u00a0for various reasons at ports of entry across the country, from Buffalo, New York, to Miami to Seattle.", "We do know that the number of those with criminal convictions stopped by Border Patrol in the first 11 months of fiscal 2018 (6,259) is 1.7 percent of the total apprehensions by Border Patrol in that time period (361,993). We also know, from CBP statistics, that nearly all of those total apprehensions occurred along the Southwest border.", "As for the Office of Field Operations figures, those with criminal convictions made up 5.2 percent of those deemed inadmissible to the U.S. (204,288) in that 11-month period, and 56.5 percent of total inadmissibles were encountered at ports of entry along the Southwest border.", "So, the administration\u2019s figure includes mostly people who tried to enter the U.S. lawfully through ports of entry, some of which aren\u2019t even on the Southwest border.", "We asked the White House and CBP if they could provide more information about these figures as they relate to the Southwest border, but we haven\u2019t received a response. We will update this article if we do.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
