Throughout American history many whites (and even some blacks), including scientists and social scientists, have made the mistake of taking this figment of the white imagination, this Sambo, as the real, true-to-life Negro.", "On their website, Prada described the Sambo-like Pradamalia line of characters featured in their display as a \"new family of mysterious creatures\":", "Inside the imaginary futuristic Prada Labs, a team of researchers set out to study Prada DNA that has proven to be so extraordinarily generative for over a century.

Raised in isolation within the austere confines of Prada Labs, each has a triangular Prada heart and a checkerboard patterned brain. Other Prada codes featured prominently in the Pradamalia morphology include metal studs, ombre tones, polished wood, printed lips, and the iconic Saffiano leather.", "Prada removed the display from the Soho store following the spread of Ezie's Facebook post, saying in a statement afterwards that:", "Prada Group abhors racist imagery. The Pradamalia are fantasy charms composed of elements of the Prada oeuvre. They are imaginary creatures not intended to have any reference to the real world and certainly not blackface. We abhor all forms of racism and racist imagery. We will withdraw all of the characters in question from display and circulation.", "As of this publication, the Pradamalia section of Prada's website was still active, although the \"monkey\" items were not immediately visible.", "Ezie criticized the company's response in a statement, saying that \"This company is completely tone deaf when it comes to race and I don't think people should be shopping there anymore.\" She also called for a full boycott against Prada and for the company to demand that any profits resulting from Pradamalia sales to be donated \"to organizations that work to combat racism.\"", "Offenhartz, Jake. \u00a0 \"Soho Prada Pulls 'Extremely Racist' Products with 'Blackface Imagery' From Window Display.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0  Gothamist. \u00a0 14 December 2018.", "O'Meally, Robert G. \u00a0 \"An Icon Through History.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0  The New York Times. \u00a0 4 January 1987.", "Prada. \u00a0 \"Pradamalia.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Accessed on 14 December 2018.", "Arturo Garcia is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
