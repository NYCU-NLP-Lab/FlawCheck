(AP photo).", "Donald Trump depicted Tim Kaine\u2019s 2006-10 tenure as governor of Virginia as a painful time of tax hike proposals and rising unemployment.", "\"He also oversaw a huge increase in illegal immigration, a tremendous increase,\" Trump told supporters at an Aug. 20 rally in Fredericksburg.", "We wondered whether Trump was correct that, under Kaine\u2019s governorship, illegal immigration spiked. We emailed the Trump campaign twice to ask about the basis of his statement, but we did not hear back.", "The GOP presidential nominee\u2019s campaign posted a version of his speech online that includes a footnote to support his claim. It\u2019s a 2007 editorial in The Washington Times that accused Kaine of failing to crack down on unauthorized immigrants who commit crimes.", "But the editorial provides no insight into whether the number of illegal immigrants in the state rose during Kaine\u2019s tenure.", "For additional insight, we reached out to the nonpartisan Pew Hispanic Center, which estimates the size of the illegal immigration population in each state.

Rather, they are estimates culled from a sample of data collected by the Census Bureau and are subject to rounding. Just like a public polls drawn from a sample, there\u2019s a margin of error involved in the estimates.", "During Kaine\u2019s time in office, the annual size of the illegal immigrant population could be 15,000 to 20,000 higher or lower than the mid-range estimate Pew reported each year, according to its report. So it\u2019s possible that a 25,000 increase from year-to-year might not outpace the Pew study\u2019s margin of error.", "The bottom line, during Kaine\u2019s tenure the size of the illegal immigrant population remained flat, Passel said.", "Nationally, the illegal immigrant population peaked in 2007 at 12.2 million and fell to 11.3 million in 2013, Pew\u2019s figures show. A major reason for that drop was the impact of the Great Recession, Passel told us.", "The Trump campaign didn\u2019t respond to a question we posed about how Kaine\u2019s policies as governor would have led to an increase in illegal immigration.", "Analysts told us that beyond state laws, many other factors contribute to where illegal immigrants choose to reside.", "Michelle Mittelstadt, a spokeswoman for the Migration Policy Institute, told us illegal immigrants often settle in a state based on how its economy is doing, and whether they already have family living there.", "Our ruling", "Trump said that while Kaine was governor, he \"oversaw a huge increase in illegal immigration, a tremendous increase.\"", "But figures from the Pew Hispanic Center show that the size of the illegal immigrant population essentially was flat during Kaine\u2019s term as governor.
