["Judge Amy Coney Barrett speaks after President Donald Trump announced Barrett as his nominee to the Supreme Court, in the Rose Garden at the White House on Sept. 26, 2020, in Washington. (AP)", "Democrats have complained loudly about the unfairness of an election-year Supreme Court selection for President Donald Trump when President Barack Obama was denied the same opportunity.", "But now that Trump has named a candidate, they\u2019re also worried about her positions on the Affordable Care Act, Obama\u2019s signature health care law.", "Joe Biden, Obama\u2019s vice president and now the Democratic presidential nominee, spoke about it in remarks he made on the Supreme Court on Sept. 27.", "\"It should come as no surprise that President Trump would nominate Judge Amy Coney Barrett,\" Biden said. \"She has a written track record, disagreeing adamantly with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to uphold the ACA. In fact, she publicly criticized Chief Justice Roberts\u2019 opinion upholding the law eight years ago.\"", "We decided to look into the evidence. We found that Barrett hasn\u2019t written a lot about the Affordable Care Act, but what she has written has been decidedly negative about the Supreme Court\u2019s 2012 ruling upholding its constitutionality.", "Her most extensive writing on the Affordable Care Act that we found was a 2017 book review titled, \"Countering the Majoritarian Difficulty.\" The book review focused on judicial restraint and when courts should invalidate laws passed by legislatures.", "Barrett\u2019s writing suggests sympathy with Supreme Court justices who are both \"originalists\" and \"textualists,\" best exemplified by Justice Antonin Scalia, a conservative icon, who objected to the majority view that upheld the Affordable Care Act in two cases: the National Federation of Business (NFIB) vs. Sibelius and and the later King vs. Burwell.", "Those cases, upheld by Chief Justice John Roberts and the court\u2019s left-leaning justices, found the law constitutional because it ultimately depended on the federal government\u2019s taxing authority to compel people to buy insurance (called the individual mandate). Scalia argued that was wrong because, among other things, the law itself called the tax a penalty.", "Barrett\u2019s review said that Roberts \"has not proven himself to be a textualist in matters of statutory interpretation.\"", "Her writing also suggested she sided with Scalia: \"To the extent that NFIB v. Sebelius expresses a commitment to judicial restraint by creatively interpreting ostensibly clear statutory text, its approach is at odds with the statutory textualism to which most originalists subscribe. Thus Justice Scalia, criticizing the majority\u2019s construction of the Affordable Care Act in both NFIB v. Sebelius and King v. Burwell, protested that the statute known as Obamacare should be renamed \u2018SCOTUScare\u2019 in honor of the court\u2019s willingness to \u2018rewrite\u2019 the statute in order to keep it afloat.\"", "The Washington Post cited an interview with Barrett in 2015 on the radio program \"On Point,\" in which Barrett said of the decision that \"it\u2019s clearly a good result that these millions of Americans won\u2019t lose their tax subsidies,\" but \"the dissent has the better of the legal argument.\" (We were unable to find a transcript or recording of the complete interview.)", "When President Trump nominated her as his selection to replace the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Barrett noted her close ties to Scalia and his judicial approach, calling him a mentor with an \"incalculable influence\" on her life and alluding to a textualist approach.", "\"His judicial philosophy is mine, too: a judge must apply the law as written. Judges are not policymakers, and they must be resolute in setting aside any policy views they might hold,\" she said.", "Finally, other liberal groups pointed to a letter Barrett signed along with many Catholic clergy, religious and legal experts that objected to the Obama administration\u2019s policies on birth control and the Affordable Care Act. The letter argued that the administration was infringing on Catholic institutions\u2019 religious liberty by requiring them to accommodate their employees\u2019 access to contraception as part of health insurance.", "We reached out to the White House and the Trump campaign, but did not hear back.", "Biden said that Barrett \"has a written track record, disagreeing adamantly with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to uphold the ACA. In fact, she publicly criticized Chief Justice Roberts\u2019 opinion upholding the law eight years ago.\"", "The track record we found is not very lengthy, and it is more academic than \"adamant.\" But it is there, and it strongly suggests Barrett would have sided with Scalia over Roberts in finding the Affordable Care Act unconstitutional.", "We rate the statement Mostly True.", "Joe Biden, comments on the Supreme Court, Sept. 27, 2020", "Amy Coney Barrett, Countering the Majoritarian Difficulty, 2017", "Washington Post, Amy Coney Barrett, a disciple of Justice Scalia, is poised to push the Supreme Court further right, Sept. 26, 2020", "Center for American Progress, Amy Coney Barrett is a Targeted Missile at the Affordable Care Act and Protections for People with Pre-Existing Conditions, Sept. 25, 2020", "Rev.com, Donald Trump SCOTUS Nomination of Amy Coney Barrett Transcript, Sept. 26, 2020", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
