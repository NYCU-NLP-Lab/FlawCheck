["Herman Cain has offered what he calls a simple tax plan to take the place of the current tax code, which he says is too complicated. Cain, a Republican candidate for president, touts a 9-9-9 plan: a 9 percent income tax, a 9 percent sales tax and a 9 percent business tax.\n\nCain\u2019s plan has gotten more attention in recent days -- and more criticism.\n\nAt the debate for the Republican nomination in Las Vegas on Oct. 18, 2011, moderator Anderson Cooper of CNN summarized those concerns. \"Mr. Cain, a lot of prominent conservatives now are coming forward saying that your 9-9-9 plan would actually raise taxes on middle-class voters, on lower-income voters,\" Cooper said.\n\n\"The thing that I would encourage people to do before they engage in this knee-jerk reaction is read our analysis. It is available at HerrmanCain.com,\" Cain said. \"It was performed by Fiscal Associates. And all of the claims that are made against it, it is a jobs plan, it is revenue-neutral, it does not raise taxes on those that are making the least. All of those are simply not true.\"\n\nHere, we wanted to check Cain\u2019s answer to Cooper\u2019s question, that the plan \"does not raise taxes on those that are making the least.\"\n\nWe\u2019ve been looking at\u00a0Cain\u2019s\u00a0plan\u00a0as part of our ongoing work fact-checking the Republican nomination contest. Based on what Cain and his campaign have said about the plan, the only exemptions on the income tax will be for charitable deductions and for undefined \"empowerment\" zones that would encourage development in inner cities. The 9 percent sales tax would apply to all new goods but not to used goods. Payroll taxes on workers would go away.\u00a0\n\nIf you pay no income tax currently -- and about half\u00a0the country doesn\u2019t -- Cain\u2019s plan means you would pay more income tax. \u00a0\n\nThe day of the debate, a new analysis was published examining Cain\u2019s tax plan. The analysis was published by the Tax Policy Center, an independent policy analysis group that includes tax analysts who have worked in both Democratic and Republican administrations.\n\nThe Tax Policy Center analyzed Cain\u2019s plan using the same type of models it has used to examine other national tax proposals.\n\nThe analysis found that Cain\u2019s tax plan would result in tax cuts for many of the wealthiest tax payers and tax increases for the poorest tax payers.\n\nThe center found that 83.8 percent of tax filers would get a tax increase under Cain\u2019s plan, compared with current tax policy.\n\nOn the other hand, most of the tax filers who make more than $1 million would get a tax cut under the Cain plan, about 95.4 percent of this high income group. And the average tax cut for millionaires would be $487,300.\n\nThe center also offered analysis of Cain\u2019s plan by income level compared with current tax policy. Most people earning lower incomes would see a tax increase.", "We should note that the Tax Policy Center said it had to make a few assumptions about Cain\u2019s plan in order to analyze the plan according to its standard economic model. So it\u2019s possible Cain may release more details that could cause these estimates to change.", "Cain said the 9-9-9 plan \"does not raise taxes on those that are making the least.\" But it would raise income taxes on \u00a0people who now have low tax burdens due to exemptions and deductions. The Tax Policy Center analysis adds more detail and found that high percentages of lower-income tax filers would see tax increases. It\u2019s true that Cain\u2019s campaign may release more details on his plan that could change this picture. But knowing what we know now about the plan, we rate Cain\u2019s statement False.", "CNN, Republican debate in Las Vegas, Oct. 18, 2011\n\nPolitiFact, Herman Cain says someone earning $50,000 will save under his 9-9-9 tax plan, Oct. 13, 2011\n\nPolitiFact, The facts about Herman Cain's 9-9-9 tax plan, Sept. 26, 2011\n\nThe Tax Policy Center, Herman Cain\u2019s 9-9-9 Tax Plan, Oct. 18, 2011\n\nThe Tax Policy Center, Herman Cain's \"9-9-9\" Tax Reform Plan; Baseline: Current Policy; Fully Phased in Distribution of Federal Tax Change by Cash Income Level, Oct. 18, 2011\n\nThe Tax Policy Center, TaxVox: Cain\u2019s 9-9-9 Plan Would Cut Taxes for the Rich, Raise Taxes for Almost Everyone Else, Oct. 18, 2011", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
