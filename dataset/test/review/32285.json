["About this rating", "With the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle scheduled to take place on 19 May 2018, the British tabloids have kicked into overdrive with gossip and speculation about behind-the-scenes drama in Britain's royal family.", "Anonymous sources were cited toward the end of December 2017 in reports that Markle was asked to sign a prenuptial agreement, sparking a \"first fight\" between the bride-to-be and Prince Harry. On the internet this unsubstantiated rumor devolved into the full-fledged claim that Queen Elizabeth has \"suspended\" the wedding until the prenuptial is signed.", "According to a 27 December article on the unreliable web site YourNewsWire, some of Markle's controversial public statements were also a factor in the alleged suspension:", "Queen Elizabeth Suspends Wedding After Meghan Markle Calls Herself \u2018Liberal Activist\u2019", "Meghan Markle\u2019s \u201cgame-playing and histrionics\u201d over the Christmas weekend left such a bad taste in Queen Elizabeth\u2019s mouth that she has forced the future princess to sign a prenuptial agreement with Prince Harry \u2014 or else the wedding is off.", "The problem with Meghan Markle is that she still insists on calling herself an \u201cactivist\u201d on her Twitter page, and she is a noted hater of the President of the United States. That could be overlooked if she would \u201cstop spreading divisive ideology\u201d on her Twitter page and instead \u201ckeep a dignified silence on political matters\u201c, but her \u201cunsuitable\u201d behavior over the Christmas weekend has left Buckingham Palace \u201cconcerned.\u201d", "We've found no real-world evidence that any of the above is the case, however.", "Although it's true that Markle, an American actress best known for her ongoing role in the television series Suits, describes herself as an \"activist\" on her Twitter profile and has been known to take political stands, particularly on women's issues, she has not tweeted at all since March 2017. And although it's true that Markle labeled then-presidential candidate Donald Trump \"divisive\" and \"misogynistic\" during a May 2016 television interview, she has made no recent public statements interpretable as \"spreading divisive ideology.\"", "One sign that Markle has already been accepted by the royal family was her invitation to the 2017 Christmas festivities at the queen's country estate in Norfolk. According to the British press, it was the first time someone who has yet to marry into the family was invited to attend such an occasion.", "The queen's formal consent is required before Prince Harry can marry (under the current rules of royal succession), but according to historian Retha Warnicke, an expert on British royal families of the past, the odds are virtually nil that she would withhold such permission.", "It also appears unlikely that a prenuptial agreement will be demanded or signed before the wedding can take place. A British family law attorney consulted by US Weekly cited the precedent set by both Prince William (Harry's brother) and Prince Charles (his father), neither of whom entered into a prenuptial agreement before they were wed.", "Your News Wire is a highly partisan fake news web site with a long history of publishing sensationalized and fabricated content.", "Hearon, Sarah. \u00a0\"Will Prince Harry and Meghan Markle Sign a Prenup?\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a0US Weekly. \u00a030 November 2017.", "Masters, James. \u00a0\"Meghan Markle and Prince Harry Join Royal Family at Sandringham.\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a0CNN. \u00a025 December 2017.", "Ross, Martha. \u00a0\"It's Hard to Imagine Meghan Markle Wanting 'Misogynistic' Donald Trump at Her Wedding.\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Bay Area News Group. \u00a027 November 2017.", "ASU Now. \u00a0\"ASU Professor Says Prince Harry's Marriage Unlikey to Rile Royal Family Dynamics.\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a01 December 2017.", "BBC News. \u00a0\"New Rules on Royal Succession Come Into Force.\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a026 March 2016.", "David Emery is a West Coast-based writer and editor with 25 years of experience fact-checking rumors, hoaxes, and contemporary legends.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
