["By Isabella Fertel", "Posted on May 5, 2020", "Social media posts falsely suggest that news outlets are misusing a boy\u2019s image to report the same child died of COVID-19 in three different countries. The posts actually refer to three different young people who died from the novel coronavirus in Portugal, Belgium and the UK.", "Older adults are at a significantly increased risk from the novel coronavirus, the World Health Organization has reported. But age is not the only factor in the COVID-19 pandemic, according to Dr. Hans Henri Kluge, the WHO regional director for Europe.", "\u201cThe very notion that \u2018COVID-19 only affects older people\u2019 is factually wrong,\u201d Kluge has stated. \u201cAs a colleague of mine recently said, \u2018Young people are not invincible.'\u201d", "Kluge added: \u201cSevere cases of the disease have been seen in people in their teens or twenties, with many requiring intensive care and some unfortunately passing away.\u201d", "In fact, cases of young people becoming ill or dying from COVID-19 have been reported around the world. But posts circulating on social media falsely imply that news media have been misusing the image of one young COVID-19 victim, reporting his death in different countries across Europe.", "One Facebook post features side-by-side screenshots of three purported articles that allegedly use the same image of a young boy to report that a child had died from COVID-19 in the UK, Portugal and Belgium. The post reads, \u201cCHILD DIES IN 3 COUNTRIES OF CORONA VIRUS.\u201d Similar claims involving the same child\u2019s photo have also appeared on Twitter.", "The content of the post, which has been widely shared across social media, is misleading on several points.", "The child pictured in the post is Vitor Rafael Bastos Godinho, a Portuguese boy who died at age 14 after testing positive for the novel coronavirus. Record, a Portuguese newspaper, first wrote about Godinho\u2019s passing on March 29. Other media outlets\u00a0quickly followed suit, publishing stories about Godinho\u2019s death alongside images of the child, including the photo used in the social media posts. Godinho is correctly identified in the screenshot from the Daily Mail (center) in the Facebook post.", "The social media post implies that news outlets then used Godinho\u2019s image to report the death of a 12-year-old girl in Belgium on March 31. The Facebook post includes screenshots of an internet search result showing a Daily Express article featuring Godinho\u2019s image with the caption, \u201cBelgium coronavirus: 12-year old girl dies of coronavirus\u2026\u201d", "Indeed, the Daily Express article does use Godinho\u2019s image, but not to depict the unnamed 12-year-old girl who had died. Rather, Godinho\u2019s photo was included in the story in reference to other young people who had died of COVID-19 in Europe, and it accurately identifies the photo as that of Godinho.", "Prior to the passing of the unnamed Belgian girl, Godinho was believed to be\u00a0\u201cEurope\u2019s youngest coronavirus victim.\u201d There are no pictures of the Belgian girl in the Daily Express article or any other article we were able to find.", "The social media post also claims that Godinho\u2019s image is being used in the news report of a 13-year-old boy in the UK, Ismail Mohamed Abdulwahab, who died from the coronavirus. The post includes a screenshot of what appears to be an article in the Daily Record, a Scottish newspaper, with the headline, \u201cSchoolboy, 13, with no health conditions becomes UK\u2019s youngest coronavirus victim.\u201d", "Abdulwahab\u2019s death on March 30 has been widely reported. Madinah College, an Islamic sciences school where Ismail\u2019s sister is a teacher, set up a GoFundMe to raise money for Abdulwahab\u2019s funeral and family. A photo of Abdulwahab does not appear in coverage of his death and funeral. There is no photo of any child with the Daily Record story. It is unclear where the incorrect combination of Godinho\u2019s image and Abdulwahab\u2019s name originated.", "So, social media posts do reference the deaths of three young people from COVID-19 in Europe. But the posts do not show that news outlets misused the same image of one boy to report the deaths of three children.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
