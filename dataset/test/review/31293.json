Newspapers who make endorsements also say positive things about other candidates, and to the best of my knowledge, that is what we did. So we never said, never said that somebody, a newspaper endorsed us that did not. What we did say is blah blah blah blah was said by the newspaper.\"", "Maddow then said, \"Just to follow up on that, the title of the ad in question was \u2018Endorsement.\u2019 \"", "Sanders responded, \"But that was only for -- that was not to be on television. That's an important point. That was just something -- as the secretary knows, you put titles on ads and you send them out, but there was no word in that ad, none, that said that those newspapers had endorsed us.\"", "As it happens, Maddow had referred specifically to one of two newspapers cited in the ad, and her choice might have allowed Sanders an out -- the ad in question did not explicitly say the Telegraph had endorsed him.", "But in his answer, Sanders broadened his response to include \"those newspapers,\" which is a problem because the initial version of the ad did explicitly include\u00a0text that said the Valley News had endorsed him when it had not. This version was later tweaked for subsequent use.", "The ad was first posted online Wednesday, Feb. 3 and touts endorsements from unions, an environmental group and The Nation magazine.", "\"From postal workers to nurses, he\u2019s been endorsed for real change,\" a narrator says in the ad.", "The narrator goes on to quote editorials from two New Hampshire newspapers, The Telegraph, of Nashua, and the Valley News, which covers both Vermont and New Hampshire from West Lebanon, N.H.", "Up to that point in the 30-second ad, every logo for an organization or publication has been accompanied by the words \"endorsed by.\" Those words disappear when the Telegraph\u2019s logo appears, along with the quote: \"He\u2019s not beholden to Wall Street Money.\"", "The words \"endorsed by\" then reappear next to the logo of the Valley News, which appears along with the quote: \"Sanders has been genuinely outraged about the treatment of ordinary Americans for as long as we can remember.\"", "Neither the Valley News \u00a0nor the Telegraph endorsed Sanders.", "Telegraph executive editor Roger Carroll posted on Twitter the afternoon of Feb. 3: \"For the record, despite @BernieSanders deceptive ad to the contrary,@NashuaTelegraph has not endorsed any Dem prez candidate #nhpolitics\"", "More problematic for Sanders\u2019 claim in the debate \u00a0is how the original ad handled the Valley News.", "Valley News editor Martin Frank said Feb. 4 that his newspaper had likewise not endorsed a Democrat in the primary, PolitiFact New Hampshire reported.", "As news of the spot\u2019s issues spread, the Sanders campaign ended up revising the ad. It removed the word \"endorsed\" by the Valley News logo, although it left the quotes from both New Hampshire newspapers untouched. That\u2019s the version of the ad that was on the campaign\u2019s official YouTube channel immediately before the debate, and the ad is still titled \"Endorsed.\"", "After the debate, Sanders spokesman Warren Gunnels told PolitiFact that the\u00a0incorrect version of the ad\u00a0never aired on\u00a0television.", "\"A\u00a0YouTube version of this ad mistakenly used this word, but it was never aired on television.
