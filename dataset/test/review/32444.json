["The five-minute video was shared to a New Zealand-based Facebook group here.", "The clip\u2019s narrator can be heard commenting on packaging of what appears to be the AstraZeneca/Oxford Covid-19 vaccine.", "She appears to Google various terms that appear on the packaging, including the term \u201cChAdOx1-S\u201d, as she speaks.", "The video then cuts to what appears to be a research page before the narrator focuses on a part which states:\u00a0\u201cChAdOx1 nCoV-19 genome in MRC-5 and A549 cell lines\u201d.", "The narrator then locates a Wikipedia page for the human foetal cell culture known as \u201cMRC-5\u201d and states: \u201cThis COVID-19 vaccine that everybody is saying going to save the world has a truckload of shit in it, but one thing it definitely has is the lung tissue of a 14-week old aborted caucasian male foetus.\u201d", "MRC-5 was derived from the lung tissue of an aborted foetus in the 1960s. The cell-line\u00a0has been used by researchers for cultivating the weakened virus components for vaccines like chickenpox, shingles and MMR vaccines.", "\u201cThe abortions were legal and agreed to by the mothers, but they were not performed for the purpose of vaccine development,\u201d The Oxford Vaccine Group states here.", "The video has also been shared in posts in multiple languages including Arabic, Czech and Russian. It has been viewed more than 200,000 times alongside a similar claim.", "The claim\u00a0is misleading -- the vaccine does not contain\u00a0MRC-5 cells.", "A spokesperson for the Oxford Vaccine Group, which is working with AstraZeneca to create the Covid-19 vaccine featured in the video, told AFP in the development on the vaccine they used\u00a0HEK-293 cells, not MRC-5 cells.", "HEK-293\u00a0was originally\u00a0cultivated from an aborted fetus in the Netherlands in 1973. The cell line\u2019s cultivator, Alex van der Eb, testified in a 2001 US FDA hearing, the reason for the abortion that the HEK-293 cells were originally cultivated from is unknown.", "HEK-293 is a cell line that has been replicated in a lab in order to cultivate the active ingredient (weakened virus) during the development and testing of vaccines.", "The\u00a0cells \u201care clones of those original cells, but are not themselves the cells of aborted babies,\u201d the Oxford Vaccine Group spokesperson told AFP in an email.", "It is\u00a0misleading to claim\u00a0that human material \"definitely\" ends up in the vaccines that use cell lines cultivated from foetuses, the Oxford Vaccine Centre explains here.", "\u201cAfter they [weakened virus/active ingredients] are grown [in the cells], the viruses are purified several times to remove the cell culture material. This makes it unlikely that any human material remains in the final vaccine,\u201d the website states.", "A Google search for the abstract featured in the section of the video where the narrator claims MRC-5 is an ingredient in the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine found a University of Bristol study published on a preprint academic journal website here.", "The study tested the efficacy of the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine formerly known as ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (now AZD1222) using a copy of an MRC-5 cell.", "The Facebook video has falsely conflated the use of MRC-5 cells in the University of Bristol study with the ingredients of the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine.", "A comparison of the study and the page referred to in the Facebook video, in another version of the video posted to a Czech video website can be seen here.", "Fact checkers from AFP have also debunked the claims in Czech here.", "AFP\u2019s global network of fact checkers have so far debunked over 690 pieces of COVID-19 related misinformation, see our full list here.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
