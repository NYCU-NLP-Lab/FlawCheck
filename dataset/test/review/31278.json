The former secretary of state did speak at a minority journalists convention in August, but that does not account for her dedicated press corps, so we rated Trump\u2019s claim Mostly True.

We will be prepared to introduce legislation as quickly as we can do so,\" Clinton said. \"I am hoping that the outcome of the election, which I am working hard to ensure a victory, will send a clear message to our Republican friends that it\u2019s time for them to quit standing in the way of immigration reform.\"", "That example alone is enough to disprove Trump\u2019s claim.
