["\u201cPresident Trump Surprise Greets the National Guard in the NATIONS CAPITOL,\u201d says a January 18 Facebook post that includes a video and a link to the clip on YouTube. It shows Trump mingling with troops in what appears to be a dining hall strung with orange decorations.", "The video has been viewed more than 53,000 times, according to the CrowdTangle social media analysis tool.", "\u201cWE DO NOT KNOW IF THIS FOOTAGE IS OF RECENTLY. IT SAYS IT IS...BUT WE ARE SKEPTICAL,\u201d says the Facebook post on the page of Free Eagle News.", "It is not, in fact, recent video.", "AFP Fact Check broke the video down frame by frame using the InVid WeVerify tool and then performed a Google reverse image search on one of the frames. This led to an article about Trump\u2019s surprise Thanksgiving visit to US troops in Afghanistan on November 28, 2019.", "Further searching of images taken during that visit led to a video tweeted by Dan Scavino, social media director at the Trump White House.", "Scavino wrote in the tweet on his official White House Twitter account on November 28: \u201cMOMENTS AGO President @realDonaldTrump visits U.S. Soldiers at Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan....\u201d", "That video is 1:36 in length, as is the one on YouTube that is linked to in the post. A comparison of frames from the video on YouTube at left, and the Scavino video on the right, shows that they are identical. Examples are shown here:", "\u201cI\u2019m unaware of President Trump visiting National Guard members supporting missions in DC in the month of January,\u201d Nahaku McFAdden, of the National Guard Bureau Public Affairs Office, told AFP by email, adding that confirmation should be sought through the White House.", "At the time of Trump\u2019s visit with troops at Bagram Airfield, the White House\u00a0released a transcript of remarks he made to them.", "But a search of the White House website for \u201cNational Guard\u201d reveals no mention of a January visit by Trump to troops in Washington. The last reference to the National Guard was in memorandums issued on December 3, 2020\u00a0for funding their deployments supporting efforts against Covid-19.", "An online search for \u201cTrump and visit and \u2018National Guard\u2019\u201d also indicates nothing about a recent visit by him to troops in the capital.", "A similar search for Vice President Mike Pence, however, confirms that he met them\u00a0on January 14, 2021.", "\u201cWe\u2019re gonna deliver to the American people a safe inauguration. We're gonna swear in the new president, a new vice president. We\u2019re gonna move our nation forward,\u201d Pence told the service members.", "They are among at least 25,000 Guard troops who have poured into the capital for the January 20 inauguration of Joe Biden after local authorities called for help on January 6 when pro-Trump rioters overwhelmed police at the Capitol.", "A session of Congress was meeting to certify Joe Biden\u2019s victory in the 2020 election when Trump supporters stormed the complex.", "The unrest led to the deaths of five people, and the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives impeached Trump on January 13 with support from 10 Republicans on a charge of \u201cincitement of insurrection.\u201d", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
