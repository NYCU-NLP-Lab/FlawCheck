It is.", "Not only did it come from a self-described satirical website, but there are other red flags, too \u2014 such as made-up characters. The story says that \u201cMaleek Bin Shalakta\u201d owns the warehouse where the cash was seized. It describes him as \u201ca man known for shady arms deals\u201d and says that he\u2019s on the U.K. terrorist watch list. But an internet search shows no results for anyone by that name, and nobody by that name is on the U.K. government\u2019s list of people targeted for sanctions due to suspected involvement in terrorist activity.", "The story also says that the same character owns a trucking company that operates in France, Germany and \u201cLatkavia.\u201d There is no country called \u201cLatkavia.\u201d", "And the picture of British police officers that is shown with the story is actually from the eviction of a group of people living in recreational vehicles parked at a warehouse on the outskirts of London last summer. The picture has nothing to do with the Clinton Foundation.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to help identify and label false stories flagged by readers on the social media network.", "\u201cBREAKING: British Intelligence Seizes Clinton Foundation Warehouse, $400 Million In Cash.\u201d ReaganWasRight.com. 10 Nov 2017.", "Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation (UK). \u201cCONSOLIDATED LIST OF FINANCIAL SANCTIONS TARGETS IN THE UK.\u201d 28 Mar 2018.", "Leo, Ben. \u201cMY BIG FAT GYPSY DELIVERY: Travellers seize new Ocado warehouse and live high life for 24 hours \u2013 before riot cops storm the building.\u201d The Sun. 22 Jun 2017.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population.
