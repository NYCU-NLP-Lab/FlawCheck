It allows U.S. citizens and legal residents to purchase insurance on health insurance exchanges, often receiving tax credits.", "But none of it applies to people who are here illegally. They don\u2019t have to follow the mandate because they shouldn\u2019t be here. They remain ineligible for regular Medicaid coverage, just as they are ineligible for food stamps. They cannot obtain coverage through state-based health insurance exchanges (thus, they are also ineligible for tax credits to offset the cost of getting that coverage).", "Now, certain low-income illegal immigrants are eligible for emergency Medicaid coverage, including childbirth and surgery.
