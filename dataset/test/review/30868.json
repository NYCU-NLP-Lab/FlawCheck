["About this rating", "A small Canadian business is offering jobs and land to people willing to relocate to Nova Scotia.", "The offer is not geared toward politically upset Americans and only applies to individuals who are legally able to work in Canada.", "A common trope in U.S. election years is Americans' declaring they will move to Canada if a candidate they highly disfavor should win the presidency. Google searches for \"move to Canada\" spiked on Super Tuesday in March 2016, and a false news story claiming that President Obama would move to Canada if Donald Trump was elected circulated widely.", "So it wasn't surprising to see Americans get excited when a Canadian business posted an interesting offer to those willing to relocate to that country.

If you decide this opportunity might fit your dreams and goals for a close to nature and community focused life, then we are willing to offer you 2 acres of woodland where you can immediately set up your tiny house or quaint cabin. Plus give you access to our farmland and other resources we have available. If you are still working with us after five years and we all still like each other after that time, then the land is yours for the cost of migrating it out and putting it in your name.", "The Farmer's Daughter Country Market offer made no appeal to Americans seeking to relocate due to election results, and they noted that their opportunity was only available to those holding Canadian residency or citizenship status:", "Please note if you are a foreign worker you cannot apply. At this time Cape Breton does not qualify for the Foreign Worker Program.", "While several news outlets, such as CNBC, also stated that this offer was only available to those already legally allowed to work in Canada, many readers were misled by headlines such as \"Small Canadian Town Will Give You a Job and Land to Relocate\" and mistakenly believed that the offer was open to all politically despondent Americans.", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
