["By Eugene Kiely", "Posted on March 22, 2017 | Updated on March 26, 2017", "President Donald Trump boasted that\u00a0TransCanada Corp. \u201cdropped\u201d a multi-billion-dollar lawsuit against the U.S. after he threatened to \u201cterminate\u201d the company\u2019s Keystone XL pipeline. That\u2019s false.", "TransCanada merely suspended its lawsuit in order to\u00a0give the Trump administration time to approve the project. The new administration is expected to approve it, but if not then TransCanada can resume its legal case against the U.S.", "Trump made his boast at a fundraiser for the National Republican Congressional Committee. As he has done in other speeches, Trump talked about clearing the way for construction of the\u00a0U.S. segment of the Keystone XL project \u2014 a 1,179-mile oil pipeline from Hardisty, Alberta, to Steele City, Nebraska. But Trump added a new twist to his Keystone story. He said he ordered Gary Cohn, director of the National Economic Council, to\u00a0threaten TransCanada to drop its lawsuit.", "Trump, March 21: And one other thing happened. I have to tell you, it\u2019s sort of interesting. So I get a call from the ex-president of Goldman Sachs who now works for \u2014 Gary Cohn. I said to him, Gary, let me ask you \u2014 I heard there was a lawsuit. I hear the pipeline company is suing us. I said, how much? $14 billion.", "I said, wait a minute. I\u2019m approving the pipeline and they\u2019re suing us for $14 billion, and I\u2019ve already approved it, right? I said, I just heard it. Go back to them and tell them if they don\u2019t drop the suit immediately we are going to terminate the deal. You have great \u2014 you know, being President gives you great power, right?", "So I just saw him this morning \u2014 I said, by the way, how did you do? He said, sir, they dropped the suit. Good.", "Trump makes a false claim about a hollow threat.", "Here are the facts: TransCanada last year filed a\u00a0request for arbitration\u00a0under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) seeking $15 billion in damages from the United States. The NAFTA claim was filed with the\u00a0International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes\u00a0after the Obama administration rejected its application for the Keystone project.", "TransCanada accused the Obama administration of killing the project for political reasons after delaying the permit process \u201cfor seven years, with full knowledge that TransCanada was continuing to invest billions of dollars in the pipeline project,\u201d\u00a0the company said in its NAFTA claim. The claim was filed July 15,2016, and arbitrators were appointed in August and September.", "(The company also filed a lawsuit in federal court in Texas seeking to reverse Obama\u2019s decisions on constitutional grounds. But that suit did not seek any monetary damages.)", "On Jan. 24, four days after taking the oath of office, Trump issued a presidential memo inviting TransCanada to refile its Keystone application. On Feb. 27,\u00a0TransCanada suspended \u2014 not \u201cdropped\u201d \u2014 its arbitration claim until March 27 to give the State Department time to approve a presidential permit needed to move ahead with the project. Both parties agreed to suspend the proceedings, according to the case details on the ICSID website.", "\u201cOur NAFTA challenge remains suspended as we continue to work with the Administration on our Presidential Permit application,\u201d\u00a0TransCanada spokesman Terry Cunha told us in an email.", "We asked Cunha if TransCanada suspended \u2014 rather than dropped \u2014 its NAFTA claim to allow the company to resume seeking damages against the U.S. if the permit is again denied. \u201cCorrect,\u201d he said.", "Simon Lester, a trade policy analyst with Cato Institute\u2019s Herbert A. Stiefel Center for Trade Policy Studies, said there is no reason for TransCanada to pursue its $15 billion claim if Trump grants approval for the Keystone project.", "\u201cThe lawsuit was a response to President Obama\u2019s rejection of the pipeline,\u201d Lester said. \u201cOnce President Trump changed policy, and encouraged TransCanada to refile its application, the original basis for the lawsuit no longer existed. Until final approval is granted, however, TransCanada might not want to terminate the proceedings completely.\u201d", "Jim Rubin, an attorney who handles trade disputes for Dorsey & Whitney, said TransCanada seems to be in a \u201cwait and see mode, which is understandable.\u201d Like Lester, Rubin said TransCanada\u2019s claim would be \u201cmoot\u201d if Trump approves the project, as expected.", "\u201cIf the Presidential permit were granted, then there is no reason to bring a claim, and in fact, such a claim would likely be unsuccessful since a permit would moot any substantive claim,\u201d Rubin told us in an email. \u201cBut if the permit were not granted, or were substantially delayed or conditioned, it is possible a NAFTA claim may still move ahead, albeit potentially amended to reflect the new decision.\u201d", "If anyone, TransCanada is the party best positioned to make a threat. The Trump administration can either approve the Keystone application or go to arbitration to settle a $15 billion claim.", "Update, March 26: The State Department issued the Presidential permit to TransCanada on March 24.", "FactCheck.org Rating:", "Read More", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
