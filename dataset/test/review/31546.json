["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on November 3, 2020", "Pennsylvania voters told to quarantine due to potential COVID-19 exposure are entitled to vote and can request and return an emergency absentee ballot through 8 p.m. on Election Day. A viral Facebook post misleadingly suggests they are being disenfranchised.", "A viral claim pushed on Facebook the day before the 2020 election misleadingly suggests that voters in Pennsylvania are being prevented from voting by the state Department of Health and threatened with arrest if they do.", "Spread by a popular conservative radio host in western Pennsylvania, the Facebook post asserts that \u201c[a]fter a reported \u2018uptick\u2019 in Covid positive cases, thousands of Pennsylvania voters in York, Lebanon, and Dauphin counties have been receiving letters from the state health department demanding that they quarantine for 14 days.\u201d", "\u201cThe letter states that they\u2019ve been exposed to Covid-19 (no proof given) and, as such, must remain quarantined and not vote in person on election day,\u201d the post continues. \u201cIf they fail to obey the order, they face possible arrest.\u201d", "It asks whether Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf\u2019s \u201cadministration is attempting to silence voters \u2014 hours before the most important election in American history?\u201d", "The post is misleading for a few reasons:", "Radio host Wendy Bell, who published the claim on Facebook, attributed the information in a subsequent live-stream video to a writer named Todd Bartley, whose story on a website called talkwilliamsport.com told of a \u201cpossible DOH voter suppression effort in Pennsylvania.\u201d", "That story focused on the purported script used by contact tracers in the state and included a copy of the state\u2019s quarantine letter instructing individuals who had close contact with someone with COVID-19 to quarantine. It makes no mention of the election or voting, as we said.", "While the story suggests the letter included was \u201cobtained\u201d and revelatory, the same exact copy \u2014 dated July and featuring the same redactions and highlighted section \u2014 was published\u00a0by another reporter in August.", "The letter instructs those who have been in contact with a person infected with COVID-19 to quarantine for 14 days. Near the end of the letter, the state Department of Health says: \u201cIf you do not cooperate with this directive, the Secretary of Health may petition a court to have you confined to an appropriate place chosen by the Department to make certain that you are not able to infect the public, and to make certain that you receive proper care.\u201d", "It continues by saying that \u201c[l]aw enforcement may be called upon, to the extent necessary, to ensure your compliance with this directive.\u201d", "April Hutcheson, a health department spokeswoman, told us in a phone interview that the \u201cquarantine letters have not changed since we started issuing them\u201d at the start of the pandemic and \u201cstates what our authority is under the law.\u201d They don\u2019t make any references to voting or the election.", "\u201cWe have not used that authority since the start of the pandemic,\u201d she said. \u201cThere has been no one prosecuted in Pennsylvania [for violating quarantine]. If you\u2019ve been contacted and been asked to quarantine, folks do the right thing and quarantine.\u201d", "Moreover, she said, no one receives the quarantine letter without first being contacted by a case manager or contact tracers, who were instructed to advise positive COVID-19 patients and close contacts on their voting options \u2014 including the option to contact their county elections officials to apply for an emergency absentee ballot, she said.", "The website of the Department of State, which oversees the election process, says: \u201cIn emergency situations (such as an unexpected illness or disability and last-minute absence) \u2026 you can\u00a0request an Emergency Absentee Ballot.\u201d The ballot needs to be returned by 8 p.m. on Election Day.", "State officials also outlined this option for quarantined individuals in an Oct. 28 Erie News Now report, and in a Nov. 2 press release.", "\u201cEvery Pennsylvanian who is registered to vote will have the opportunity to do so,\u201d Pennsylvania\u2019s Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar said in the press release, which was published following the viral claim\u2019s spread. \u201cThere\u2019s an emergency ballot provision under the law. If you can\u2019t deliver your own balloting materials you can assign a designee to do that for you. And if you can\u2019t find a designee, the law actually requires the county election office to have a Sheriff\u2019s Deputy or some county official to deliver the balloting materials for the voter.\u201d", "Hutcheson also said the state would not prevent voters from casting a ballot in person \u2014 or arrest them, for that matter \u2014 if they showed up to do so despite quarantine directives. Health officials do not provide state and local elections officials with records that would enable them\u00a0to identify people directed to quarantine, she said.", "\u201cIf you were to show up at a polling place, no one would be able to stop you,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is your right to go vote, but we would prefer if you tested positive \u2026 that you would get an absentee ballot.\u201d", "She likened voting to other essential tasks, such as leaving home to get groceries.", "The state has reported more than 200,000 COVID-19 cases and nearly 9,000 deaths during the pandemic.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.

Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
