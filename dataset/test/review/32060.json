Murphy said the government should \"keep military-style weapons of war out of our communities and out of the hands of criminals and terrorists.\"", "Murphy\u2019s campaign did not provide any specifics about what types of guns, other than to call them \"military-style assault rifles\" and \"dangerous weapons of war.\"", "Technically there\u2019s no true definition of what makes a particular rifle an \"assault weapon.\" There\u2019s no clear, legal interpretation of any of the descriptions Murphy and other gun control advocates are using, giving the NRA wide berth in its attack.", "Put simply, the term \"semi-automatic\" refers to any firearm designed to fire one bullet with one trigger squeeze, then automatically reload the chamber and be ready to fire again.", "This is different from an automatic weapon, in which squeezing the trigger once fires multiple times until the shooter lets go. Automatic weapons sales have been restricted in the United States since 1934.

Cartridges are fed from magazines and are fired one at a time with each trigger pull. They are used for self-defense and recreational shooting, just as the NRA said. About half of all guns are semi-automatic.", "Handguns are far more prevalent in crimes.

Kovandzic said in the research he\u2019s seen, these types of \"assault weapons\" are used in less than 2 percent of gun crimes.", "Of course, the NRA words the claim in such a way that there could be some confusion about Murphy\u2019s wishes.
