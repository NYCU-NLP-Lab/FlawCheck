["The Donald Trump administration has drafted an executive order that would cut U.S. payments to the United Nations by as much as 40 percent. Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, highlighted the substantial role the United States plays in funding the U.N. during the confirmation hearing for U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley.", "\"When all of our taxpayers are paying roughly 22 percent of the budget, I think they do expect to see a more efficient and an organization that's more objective and more in keeping with our values,\" Portman said on Jan. 18, 2017. \"How do you intend to support U.S. national security interests, but also ensure that the U.N. is a more effective body toward promoting a more peaceful and less volatile world?\"", "The U.N. and U.S. budget documents show Portman\u2019s number is correct, and if peacekeeping is included, the percentage gets even higher.", "The current U.N. regular budget calls for $5.4 billion over two years. By a formula based on the size of a country\u2019s economy and other factors, America\u2019s assessment is set at 22 percent, or about $1.2 billion.", "Based on the last Obama administration budget, the United States provided $1.2 billion to the U.N. over two years, and Portman is correct.", "But that\u2019s just for the U.N.\u2019s regular budget. There are over a dozen other U.N. agencies and operations that American dollars also support. The single largest is peacekeeping with a price tag of about $7.8 billion this year alone. The U.S. share of that cost is over 28 percent, or $2.2 billion.", "The next three U.N. agencies -- all roughly in the $100 million per year range -- are the World Health Organization, the Food and Agriculture Organization and the International Atomic Energy Agency.", "All told, the United States provides about $3.3 billion a year to finance U.N. activities. A 40 percent cut would save taxpayers about $1.3 billion out of the current $4.1 trillion U.S. federal budget. The impact on the U.N. would be substantial, although the precise effect would depend on how the cuts are spread around.", "Our ruling", "Portman said American taxpayers cover 22 percent of the U.N. budget. Budget documents from the U.N. and the United States confirm that. The percentage for peacekeeping operations is even higher.", "We rate this claim True.", "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/63427eda-6b4a-44ef-8a7b-173dcc05f504", "C-SPAN, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Confirmation Hearing, Jan. 18, 2017", "United Nations, Fifth Committee Recommends $5.4 Billion Budget for 2016-2017 Biennium, Dec. 23, 2015", "United Nations, Scale of assessments for the apportionment of the expenses of the United Nations, Dec. 23, 2015", "United Nations, Proposed programme budget for the biennium 2016-2017, Dec. 23, 2015", "U.S. State Department, FY 2017 State Department budget request, accessed Feb. 1, 2017", "United Nations, Financing peacekeeping, accessed Jan. 19, 2017", "United Nations, Contributors to U.N. peacekeeping operations, Dec. 31, 2016", "New York Times, Trump Administration Holds Off on Issuing U.N.
