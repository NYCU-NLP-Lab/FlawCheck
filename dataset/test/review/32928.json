["By Eugene Kiely, D'Angelo Gore and Robert Farley", "Posted on November 2, 2018", "In the final days of the 2018 election, Republicans across the country are running TV ads about immigration that falsely accuse some Democrats of wanting \u201copen borders,\u201d plotting to \u201cabolish ICE,\u201d supporting \u201csanctuary cities\u201d and more. The ads contain evocative images of\u00a0tattooed gang members and \u201ccaravans\u201d of Central Americans traveling through Mexico in search of asylum.", "The Republicans are following the lead of President Donald Trump, who in recent days has labeled the Central American asylum seekers \u201can invasion\u201d and ordered the U.S. military to guard the Southern border. He also has said he will sign an executive order ending birthright citizenship, although the legality of such a unilateral action has been challenged by constitutional scholars.", "A database of TV ads maintained by Kantar Media\u2019s Campaign Media Analysis Group shows that 162 TV ads airing in the last seven days, since Oct. 27, contain \u201canti-immigration\u201d messages. Here we look at some of those ads.", "TV ads in Arkansas\u2019 2nd Congressional District falsely portray Democratic candidate Clarke Tucker as wanting to abolish the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.", "Rep. French Hill, a two-term congressman, is airing a TV ad called \u201cWe Must Enforce the Law\u201d that shows images of tattooed members of a transnational gang known as the Mara Salvatrucha, or MS-13, and warns that they are \u201cinfiltrating America.\u201d (As we have written, the MS-13 gang has had a presence in the U.S. since the early 1980s, beginning in Southern California, and currently numbers about 10,000 \u2014 a figure the Department of Justice has been using since 2006.)", "The announcer says, \u201cMS-13, the most dangerous gang infiltrating America, but Washington liberals want to get rid of ICE, the police enforcing our immigration laws and protecting our border from MS-13.\u201d Photos of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer appear on the screen as the announcer says \u201cWashington liberals,\u201d even though neither Pelosi\u00a0nor Schumer\u00a0support abolishing ICE.", "The ad then says that Tucker \u201cattended an anti-ICE rally\u201d and \u201crefused to take a position\u201d on the \u201cabolish ICE\u201d movement. It quotes Tucker as saying, \u201cI don\u2019t know what it is.\u201d\u00a0This is misleading. Tucker did not attend an \u201canti-ICE rally,\u201d and he has taken a position on ICE.", "On the immigration issue page on his\u00a0website,\u00a0Tucker says, \u201cLike the vast majority of Americans, I support ICE and our Homeland Security agencies in carrying out the mission to keep our borders safe and strong, while increasing accountability and transparency in our immigration enforcement through common-sense strategic investments.\u201d", "So what is the ad talking about?", "The ad misuses a short clip of a GOP partisan asking Tucker a question at a \u201cFamilies Belong Together\u201d rally (not an \u201canti-ICE rally\u201d) on June 30. The rally opposed the Trump administration\u2019s \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy, which caused the separation of families. Tucker was asked if he supports Sen.\u00a0Kirsten Gillibrand\u2019s position on ICE; two days earlier, on June 28, Gillibrand said in an interview: \u201cI believe you should get rid of [ICE], start over, re-imagine it, and build something that actually works.\u201d", "In the full video, which can be found on YouTube, Tucker can be seen politely saying he wasn\u2019t familiar with Gillibrand\u2019s position on ICE. \u201cI have not had a chance to look at that,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what it is, so \u2013\u201d\u00a0He was told that Gillibrand wants to \u201cabolish ICE,\u201d and he repeated: \u201cThat\u2019s not something I\u2019ve spent any time thinking about. I don\u2019t have any information about it.\u201d", "Since then, Tucker has given it thought and has taken a position \u2014 but the TV ad ignores that. So does another ad by the\u00a0Republican Majority Fund, which is a PAC affiliated with Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas.", "The Republican Majority Fund falsely accuses Tucker of being on the side of \u201cHollywood liberals\u201d and \u201cWashington politicians\u201d who want to get rid of ICE. It shows the same clip of Tucker at the June 30 rally, and then the announcer says,\u00a0\u201cClarke Tucker won\u2019t tell us where he stands because he is on their side.\u201d Kantar/CMAG says the ad first started running on July 29, but it has been back on the air in the last seven days.", "The TV ad by the Hill campaign also makes the claim that Tucker is now \u201cembracing sanctuary cities,\u201d saying he \u201cjust doesn\u2019t get it. We must enforce the law and stop MS-13.\u201d The ad provides no support for that claim, and the campaign did not get back to us when we called. However, we did find one mention of Tucker taking a position on so-called \u201csanctuary cities.\u201d", "In a Sept. 21 article, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette wrote that Tucker said he supports protecting those living in the U.S. illegally from federal immigration officers only when they are seeking emergency health care or reporting a crime. \u201cTucker said Thursday that he supports\u00a0sanctuary cities\u00a0in the limited context of allowing people in the country illegally to go to the hospital or report crime without fearing deportation.\u201d", "That\u2019s the opposite of shielding MS-13 gang members from ICE, and nothing at all like official sanctuary policies that are adopted by some cities and municipalities.", "Such policies, among other things, prevent local law enforcement from investigating civil and criminal immigration violations, limit local law enforcement from complying with federal immigration detainers and warrants, and refuse to give ICE access to local jails, according to an analysis of \u201cover 500 sanctuary\u00a0policies spanning nearly four decades\u201d by a group of law school professors for an article published\u00a0May\u00a029\u00a0in the Boston College Law Review.", "Former Tennessee Gov. Phil Bredesen and Rep. Marsha Blackburn are vying for an open Senate seat in a race considered a toss-up by The Cook Political Report.", "Tennesseans for a Better Tomorrow, a group supporting Blackburn\u2019s campaign, has been airing a TV ad in the last seven days on immigration that makes one false and one misleading claim.", "The ad falsely claims, \u201cBredesen gave driver\u2019s licenses to illegal immigrants.\u201d In fact, Bredesen wasn\u2019t governor when that bill became law.\u00a0He took office\u00a0in 2003. State records show the bill was signed into law by Republican Gov. Dan Sundquist on May 3, 2001.", "The 2001 law turned Tennessee into \u201ca haven for illegal immigrants seeking driver\u2019s licenses\u201d for ID purposes, as the Associated Press put it,\u00a0and Bredesen\u2019s office responded by developing legislation that ended the practice of issuing driver\u2019s licenses to those living in the U.S. illegally. Instead, a new law \u2014 which Bredesen signed May 28, 2014\u00a0\u2014 allowed them to receive \u201cdriving certificates\u201d that could not be used for ID purposes.", "The\u00a0Knoxville News-Sentinel\u00a0called the new law \u201cthe toughest driver\u2019s license policy in the nation in dealing with illegal aliens.\u201d The paper said that \u201cthe present driver\u2019s license system will remain for Tennesseans who have a valid social security number or proof they are a legal, permanent resident of the United States.\u201d However, it wrote, \u201cFor others, a new category of \u2018driving\u00a0certificate\u2019 is created. The certificates carry, in bold letters, the words \u2018for driving purposes only \u2014 not valid for identification.'\u201d", "But even that new law proved problematic. Bredesen signed legislation ending the program entirely after it was discovered that \u201csome testing centers were selling licenses and certificates to out-of-state illegal immigrants,\u201d according to an Associated Press account at the time.", "The TV ad also takes a Bredesen quote out of context. The announcer says, \u201cBredesen said, \u2018I don\u2019t believe the wall is the right answer.\u2019\u201d He said more than that.", "The Tennessean, which conducted that interview with Bredesen, says\u00a0the Democratic candidate also said that he preferred more technological security measures.", "Tennessean, Sept. 28:\u00a0Bredesen\u2019s comment came in response to a question about whether he would support a compromise bill that would include fixing the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program with funding a wall along the southern border of the United States.", "Bredesen said while the country is entitled to control\u00a0its borders, he added there are \u201ctechnologically much sounder and less expensive ways of doing it than building a wall.\u201d", "So, Bredesen supports border security, but thinks there are less expensive and more effective ways of doing it.", "Texans Are, a super PAC that supports Sen. Ted Cruz, is running an ad that makes the false claim that Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke is \u201cagainst background checks for refugees from terrorist hotbeds.\u201d", "O\u2019Rourke is not in favor of eliminating the screening process for refugees.", "The ad starts with scenes of Central Americans walking in the street, leaving their countries to seek asylum from Mexico and the United States.\u00a0\u201cThe caravan is coming,\u201d the announcer says. \u201cSome say criminals among them.\u201d", "To support its claim about O\u2019Rourke opposing background checks for refugees, the TV ad cites O\u2019Rourke\u2019s vote in 2015 against H.R. 4038, the American Security Against Foreign Enemies Act, or the American SAFE Act. That bill, which passed the House but failed in the Senate, would have added additional screening for refugees coming from Iraq and Syria, and required the FBI to investigate applicants in addition to the Department of Homeland Security.", "O\u2019Rourke argued that the process at the time was already thorough.", "In a post on the blogging platform Medium, O\u2019Rourke explained his \u201cno\u201d vote, in part, by saying: \u201cThe process proposed in today\u2019s bill would create unnecessary, duplicative work and processes for U.S. security agencies. This would significantly delay the current rigorous process by up to 2 years, according to the Administration. In effect, it would close the door on refugees during the single greatest humanitarian crisis of our time.\u201d", "In 2015, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services said refugees already receive \u201cthe highest degree of security screening and background checks for any category of traveler to the United States.\u201d", "The process includes fingerprinting and checking records against databases maintained by the National Counterterrorism Center, the Department of Defense, the FBI and Interpol. Each refugee applicant is also interviewed personally by specially trained USCIS officers. And those from Syria are subjected to special measures including iris scans and an \u201cenhanced review\u201d by Homeland Security.", "In the Georgia governor\u2019s race, much has been made of comments from Democratic candidate Stacey Abrams that an upcoming \u201cblue wave\u201d of Democratic victory in the midterm elections would be comprised of a variety of people including \u201cthose who are documented and undocumented.\u201d Abrams\u2019 opponents have seized on the comment to argue Abrams wants to allow immigrants in the country illegally to vote in the upcoming election.", "Abrams says her words are being twisted, and she has repeatedly clarified that she does not believe people in the country illegally ought to be allowed to vote.", "The attack surfaced in an ad from the Georgia Republican Party, which uses a clip of her comment, then says, \u201cAbrams will let illegal immigrants vote.\u201d", "The comments used in the ad came during a recent campaign event attended by Sen. Elizabeth Warren. Here\u2019s the full context of Abrams\u2019 comments:", "Abrams, Oct. 9: We are 28 days from real change. Twenty eight days before we tell Georgia who we are. And when we change Georgia, we change the South. And when we change the South, we change America. And that change starts right here. Because the thing of it is, blue waves aren\u2019t blue. That\u2019s what we use because that\u2019s the color that we embrace. The thing of it is, the blue wave is African American. It\u2019s white, it\u2019s Latino. It\u2019s Asian-Pacific Islander. It is disabled. It is differently-abled, It is LGBTQ. It is law enforcement. It is veterans. It is made up of those who\u2019ve been told that they are not worthy of being here. It is comprised of those who are documented and undocumented. It\u2019s made up of those who have been told they are successful and those who have been told they are left behind. But the real wave is when we come together and we tell Georgia, \u201cWe\u2019re here and we\u2019re not going anywhere.\u201d", "In an appearance on Fox News on Oct. 15, her opponent, Secretary of State Brian Kemp, the Republican nominee, cited\u00a0those comments to claim that Abrams \u201cwants illegals to vote in Georgia.\u201d", "\u201cI think hard-working Georgians should decide who their governor is, not people here illegally like my opponent wants,\u201d Kemp said.", "Abrams responded that Kemp was \u201cwillfully\u201d twisting her words.", "\u201cI\u2019ve never once argued for anyone who was not legally allowed to vote in the state of Georgia to be allowed to vote,\u201d Abrams said. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve asked for is that he allow those who are legally allowed to vote to actually cast a ballot.\u201d", "Abrams has repeatedly criticized Kemp for championing an \u201cexact match\u201d law, which requires voter registration information to match driver\u2019s licenses, state ID cards or Social Security records, and which resulted in more than 53,000 voter registration applications being put on hold.", "In a debate on Oct. 23, Kemp again challenged Abrams on her \u201cblue wave\u201d comments.", "\u201cWell, Miss Abrams, as you know in a recent video you called on illegals to vote for you in this election,\u201d Kemp said. \u201cI was actually shocked, I had to watch that video twice. It clearly shows that you are asking for undocumented and documented folks to be part of your winning strategy. So my question is, \u2018Why are you encouraging people to break the law for you in this election?\u201d", "Abrams again repeated that Kemp was distorting her position.", "\u201cMr. Kemp you are very aware that I know the laws of Georgia when it comes to voting,\u201d Abrams said. \u201cIn fact, I am one of the foremost experts in the state on expansion of voting rights. And I have never in my life asked for anyone who is not legally eligible to vote to be able to cast a ballot. What I\u2019ve asked for is that you allow those who are legally eligible to vote, to allow them to cast their ballots.\u201d", "Later in the debate, she reiterated that point, saying, \u201cI only believe that those who have the legal eligibility to vote should cast a ballot.\u201d", "Editor\u2019s Note: For our story on Democratic ads, see \u201cDemocratic Closing Ads: Health Care and Taxes.\u201d", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
