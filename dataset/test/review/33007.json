If you want to go out, perhaps we can get him to pay for drinks at Park. Since we have not slept together, he will of course be trying to impress me and will, therefore, do anything I ask. Unlike John, who fell asleep during sex last night. I went over to his place last night around 11:30. We started having sex. When I noticed his eyes were closed for a little too long, I said \"John wake up.\" At which, point he shot up saying \"what'd I miss.\" Yes, I think that is a new low.", "Let me know about tonight.
