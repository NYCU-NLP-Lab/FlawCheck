["After former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush faced a tough couple of weeks related to his comments about whether he would have invaded Iraq even if he had known about faulty intelligence, he used a new tactic in New Hampshire: Blame President Barack Obama.", "\"The world is radically different, and so the focus ought to be on \u2018knowing what you know now, Mr. President, would you, should you have kept 10,000 troops in Iraq?\u2019 \" Bush said at a roundtable event in Portsmouth May 20.", "Bush noted that the Iraqi city of Ramadi had been taken over by ISIS the day before his roundtable. He then continued:", "\"ISIS didn\u2019t exist when my brother was president. Al-Qaida in Iraq was wiped out when my brother was president. There were mistakes made in Iraq for sure, but the surge created a fragile but stable Iraq that the president could have built on.....\" He then criticized how Obama has handled Iraq.", "We decided to fact-check Bush\u2019s claims that ISIS did not exist under President George W.\u00a0Bush and that al-Qaida was wiped out in Iraq.

It's the same group throughout.\"", "\u2018Al-Qaida in Iraq was wiped out when my brother was president\u2019", "Al-Qaida\u2019s power waxed and waned over the years, but was it \"wiped out,\" as Jeb Bush said?", "The group\u2019s targeting of Sunni civilians, which led to a backlash, combined with operations by Coalition forces and the Iraqi government, weakened the group in 2007.", "The Congressional Research Service wrote in August 2008 that U.S. officials concluded that al-Qaida in Iraq was \"weakened almost to the point of outright defeat \u00a0in Iraq, although they say it remains lethal and has the potential to revive in Iraq.\"", "The surge under Bush was successful -- the attacks al-Qaida was carrying out had significantly declined by January 2009 when Bush left office.", "\"Literally everybody viewed this as a defeat for ISIS,\" Gartenstein-Ross said. \"When I say everybody I mean al-Qaida included. They viewed this as a major defeat to its brand.\"", "A spokesman for Jeb Bush pointed to several articles that noted how the group was weakened, including a Washington Post article that stated that in 2009 \"the power of the Islamist militancy in Iraq was at its lowest ebb, and the number of killings had plunged.\"", "In 2010, Vice President Joe Biden declared success in Iraq. When the combat mission ends, he said the administration \"will be able to point to it and say, \u2018We told you what we\u2019re going to do, and we did it.\u2019\"", "But three factors led the group to a comeback: the Syrian war, the Iraqi government ruled in a sectarian way that alienated Sunnis, and the U.S. withdrew troops.", "Two experts we interviewed disagreed with each other on the extent that al-Qaida was \"wiped out\" under Bush.", "\"There is no doubt that the surge hurt AQI/ISI deeply,\" Fishman told PolitiFact Florida. \"The group was much weaker as a result.

Al-Qaida was significantly weakened by President Bush and company, but it was not wiped out. Moreover, the dynamics that the Iraq war set in motion contributed to the rise of ISIL, because Syria facilitated movement of many foreign fighters in and out of Iraq, and some of them resettled in Syria after the Iraq surge.", "\"Also, al-Qaida in Iraq didn\u2019t really exist before the 2003 invasion,\" O\u2019Hanlon said. \"So it\u2019s too clean and neat for Gov. Bush to make the statement he did; there are kernels of truth in his claim but it misses a broader reality.\"", "Our ruling", "Bush said, \"ISIS didn't exist when my brother was President. Al-Qaida in Iraq was wiped out when my brother was president.\"", "There are problems with both pieces of Bush\u2019s claim. Yes, a group called ISIS didn\u2019t exist while Bush was president, but the roots of the organization were indeed present and operating under a different banner.", "As far as claiming al-Qaida was \"wiped out,\" most experts consider that a stretch. The group\u2019s power certainly diminished under Bush but it wasn\u2019t wiped out.", "Bush\u2019s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.
