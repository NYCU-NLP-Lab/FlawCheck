John McCain accused Sen. Barack Obama of failing to repudiate nasty statements against McCain involving racial politics.", "\u201cCongressman John Lewis, an American hero, made allegations that Sarah Palin and I were somehow associated with the worst chapter in American history, segregation, deaths of children in church bombings, George Wallace. That, to me, was so hurtful,\u201d McCain said during the Hofstra University debate on Oct. 15, 2008.", "\u201cAnd, Senator Obama, you didn\u2019t repudiate those remarks.\u201d", "McCain referred to comments by Rep. Lewis, D-Georgia, who is an icon in the civil rights movement. In a statement Oct. 11, 2008, Lewis related the tenor of McCain campaign events to political tactics by segregationist Alabama Gov. George Wallace that encouraged attacks over people seeking civil rights protections in the 1960s.", "\u201cWhat I am seeing reminds me too much of another destructive period in American history,\u201d Lewis wrote. \u201cSen. McCain and Gov. Palin are sowing the seeds of hatred and division, and there is no need for this hostility in our political discourse.\u201d", "Lewis issued his statement after news reports catalogued a series of McCain campaign events in which some audience members shouted such things as \u201cterrorist\u201d and \u201ckill him\u201d when Obama\u2019s name was mentioned by the speakers. The remarks came as the McCain campaign embarked on a decidedly aggressive approach, focusing on Obama\u2019s long-ago association with 1960s radical William Ayers.", "But the question is whether Obama was silent when Lewis likened the tone of the McCain rallies to those of Wallace and the segregationists. Obama\u2019s campaign did break with Lewis\u2019 statement the same day he made it, although it also said Lewis \u201cwas right to condemn\u201d statements by Palin associating Obama with terrorists.", "Here\u2019s the statement Obama campaign spokesman Bill Burton issued on Oct. 11:", "\u201cSenator Obama does not believe that John McCain or his policy criticism is in any way comparable to George Wallace or his segregationist policies.\u00a0 But John Lewis was right to condemn some of the hateful rhetoric that John McCain himself personally rebuked just last night, as well as the baseless and profoundly irresponsible charges from his own running mate that the Democratic nominee for President of the United States \u2018pals around with terrorists.\u2019", "\u201cAs Barack Obama has said himself, the last thing we need from either party is the kind of angry, divisive rhetoric that tears us apart at a time of crisis when we desperately need to come together.\u00a0 That is the kind of campaign Senator Obama will continue to run in the weeks ahead.\u201d", "But that statement never explicitly said Lewis was wrong \u2014 which is crucial to repudiating someone or something. Instead, Obama\u2019s campaign said Lewis\u2019 comparison wasn\u2019t correct.", "In the debate, Obama did say Lewis \u201cinappropriately drew a comparison\u201d between the civil rights trouble and McCain rallies.", "Lewis later said he could have phrased his words differently, because he didn\u2019t want to relate McCain and Palin directly to Wallace\u2019s tactics. But he said he accomplished his goal of highlighting the dangerous tone of the rallies.", "Obama\u2019s campaign did promptly issue a statement, disputing the comparison that Lewis made. But that\u2019s not the same as \u201crepudiating\u201d or admonishing Lewis for making that comparison. Because Obama\u2019s campaign never specifically criticized Lewis, we rate McCain\u2019s statement as True.", "Politico.com,\n\nU.S. Rep.
