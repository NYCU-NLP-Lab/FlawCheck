["About this rating", "In early October 2018, social media users shared a meme bearing a critical message about Sen. Joe Manchin, the lone Democrat who voted to confirm U.S. Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, and his daughter, Mylan CEO Heather Bresch:", "It's no secret Bresch is the daughter of the U.S. senator from West Virginia, and that father and daughter were the subjects of two very different and unrelated controversies.", "Bresch runs Mylan, the manufacturer of EpiPen, a medical device that delivers a dose of life-saving epinephrine to people with severe allergies which can result in a deadly reaction known as anaphylaxis. In late summer 2016, Mylan was widely criticized for hiking the price of EpiPens by more than 400 percent, taking the price of the device from $100 in 2009 to roughly $600 in 2016.", "Manchin, on the other hand, earned the ire of his party and other critics when he broke ranks on 6 October 2018 and voted to confirm Brett Kavanaugh, who had been accused by three women of sexual misconduct while he was a high school and college student, to the United States Supreme Court. One of the accusers, California college professor Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified about being assaulted as a 15-year-old, sparking an outcry and protests against Kavanaugh's confirmation. Mancin's vote broke the tie between Republican and Democratic senators, who otherwise voted along party lines.", "Amid the EpiPen controversy, Manchin voiced his support for his daughter, saying, \"My daughter is my daughter with unconditional love, and she's the most amazing person that I know. She's so compassionate and generous in how she's always lived her life.\"", "It was not the first time Bresch's role at Mylan was used to attack her father politically -- in fact, Manchin took heat over it from the other side of the aisle as he fought to keep his seat in the November 2018 midterm elections:", "The RNC bashed Manchin after Mylan announced it was laying off 500 people at a plant in West Virginia. Manchin has taken heat before from his opponents over Mylan\u2019s decision a few years ago to jack up the price of allergy drug EpiPen by 500 percent.", "\u201cAmidst the layoffs and scandals, Mylan has continued to contribute to Manchin's war chest for his upcoming election,\u201d an RNC bulletin said. \u201cMylan executives and employees contributed more than $50,000 to Manchin's campaign in the first quarter of 2018.\u201d", "However, barring some yet-unknown potential future ruling by Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court that might benefit Mylan, it's unclear why the meme's makers considered the familial relationship between Manchin and Bresch relevant, other than to imply some vague nefarious characteristic they supposedly share.", "Wright, David. \u00a0 \"Manchin Defends CEO Daughter After Company Raised EpiPen Price.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 CNN. \u00a0 7 September 2016.", "McClausland, Phil. \u00a0 \"Mylan Releases $300 Generic EpiPen After Price Hike Outrage.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 NBC News. \u00a0 16 December 2016.", "King, Robert. \u00a0 \"Republicans Tarnish Joe Manchin with EpiPen Scandal.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Washington Examiner. \u00a0 28 April 2018.", "Bethania Palma is a journalist from the Los Angeles area who has been working in the news industry since 2006.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
