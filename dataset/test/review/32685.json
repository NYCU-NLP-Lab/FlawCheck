["By Robert Farley", "Posted on November 14, 2017", "President Donald Trump left a false impression that a plane carrying former President Barack Obama \u201ccame close but it didn\u2019t land\u201d in the Philippines due to poor relations between the countries.", "Obama did have a strained relationship with current Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, and Obama never visited the Southeast Asian country while Duterte was in charge (though Obama did visit the Philippines twice before Duterte was president). But, contrary to Trump\u2019s account, Obama never had a flight to the Philippines diverted.", "Trump\u2019s odd comment came during a press gaggle in Manila on the tail end of the president\u2019s trip to Asia.", "After meeting with Duterte, Trump said the relationship between the Philippines and the U.S. was now \u201cprobably better than ever before.\u201d Under Obama, the relationship between the U.S. and the Philippines was \u201chorrible,\u201d Trump told the gathered press. He added, \u201cYou know what happened. Many of you were there, and you never got to land. The plane came close but it didn\u2019t land.\u201d", "We have no idea what Trump was referring to, and the White House press office offered no on-the-record clarification.", "It\u2019s true that Obama cancelled a scheduled meeting with Duterte that had been planned for Sept. 6, 2016, at a regional summit in Laos. A day earlier, the Philippines president called Obama a \u201cson of a bitch\u201d and warned the U.S. president not to challenge him over extrajudicial killings.\u00a0According to AP, \u201c[m]ore than 2,000 suspected drug pushers and users have been killed since Duterte launched a war on drugs after taking office on June 30,\u201d 2016.", "At a press conference in China, Obama was told of Duterte\u2019s remarks. Obama referred to Duterte as a \u201ccolorful guy,\u201d and said that a meeting between the two men was only worth having if \u201cit\u2019s actually productive and we\u2019re getting something done.\u201d Within hours, Obama canceled the meeting with Duterte and met instead with\u00a0South Korean President Park Geun-hye.", "Prior to Duterte\u2019s presidency, Obama visited the Philippines in April 2014 and again in November 2015. In the 2014 visit, Obama met with then Philippine president, Benigno S. Aquino III, and announced \u2014 among other things \u2014 a 10-year agreement that will allow the U.S. greater access to military bases in the region. During the visit to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in 2015, Obama discussed his support for the Trans-Pacific Partnership.", "As we said, Duterte assumed the presidency on June 30, 2016, so his tenure overlapped Obama\u2019s last six months in office. It\u2019s true, as we said, that Obama visited the region when he attended the East Asia Summit Meeting in Laos that September. However, we could find no record of a planned stop in the Philippines during that trip.", "So it\u2019s unclear why Trump told the press, \u201cYou know what happened. Many of you were there, and you never got to land. The plane came close but it didn\u2019t land.\u201d The comment suggests Air Force One was denied landing privileges in Philippines, or that\u00a0Obama called off a trip while en route to the Philippines. There\u2019s no evidence either of those things happened.", "FactCheck.org Rating:", "Read More", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
