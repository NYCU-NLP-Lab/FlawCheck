While staffers were removed from the White House, that happened nearly a year ago and by calling it a \"raid\" over dramatizes the actual news. The same story appeared on another website in February.", "The story by New Century Times said that an intelligence agency decided to fight back and sent Trump a message by escorting six staffers out of the White House for failing background investigations.", "By calling the event an \"FBI raid\" it conjures up an image of armed personnel storming the White House to take out suspicious staffers. But that\u2019s not the way it sounded in news reports.", "The website attributed much of the information to Western Journalism, which describes itself as a source of conservative and libertarian news. In reality, the story traces back to an article in Politico.", "Western Journalism reported Feb. 16 that the six staffers were escorted from the White House for problems with their SF86 application, a questionnaire for national security positions. The questionnaire, more than 100 pages long, includes questions on the applicant\u2019s employment, criminal and residential history and also asks about personal subjects such as about an applicant\u2019s mental health and use of illicit drugs.", "The Western Journalism article followed an article by Politico, which reported based on unnamed sources that some of the aides were \"walked out of the building by security.\"", "One of the six staffers was Caroline Wiles, the daughter of Susan Wiles, Trump\u2019s Florida campaign director, Politico reported.
