["By Eugene Kiely, Robert Farley and Lori Robertson", "Posted on October 4, 2018", "Speaking to supporters in Mississippi, President Donald Trump made a series of false statements about Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s sworn testimony about an alleged sexual assault.", "Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh assaulted her when the two were in high school 36 years ago.\u00a0In mocking Ford\u2019s memory of the event, the president wrongly quoted her as saying, \u201cI had one beer, that\u2019s the only thing I remember.\u201d But Ford provided many details of the alleged attack.", "Specifically, Trump falsely claimed that, during her Sept. 27 testimony, Ford did not know what year the alleged attack occurred (she said the summer of 1982), whether the alleged attack happened upstairs or downstairs (she said in a bedroom upstairs) and the neighborhood where it occurred (she said in the Bethesda area).", "Trump\u2019s remarks came at a\u00a0Make America Great Again rally in Southaven, Mississippi. The president accused the Democrats of \u201ctrying to destroy Judge Kavanaugh since the very first second he was announced,\u201d and then he went on to make a series of false claims about Kavanaugh\u2019s accuser.", "Trump, Oct. 2:\u00a0But I\u2019ll have to tell you, the appointment of a Supreme Court justice \u2014 and I look at him, and I looked at the man that we appointed just before him, Justice Neil Gorsuch who was put through the paces, but nothing like what\u2019s happening now. \u2026", "What he\u2019s going through: 36 years ago, this happened. \u201cI had one beer.\u201d Right? \u201cI had one beer.\u201d \u201cWell, you think it was\u2026\u201d \u201cNope, it was one beer.\u201d \u201cOh, good. How did you get home?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t remember.\u201d \u201cHow did you get there?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t remember.\u201d \u201cWhere is the place?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t remember.\u201d \u201cHow many years ago was it?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know.\u201d", "\u201cWhat neighborhood was it in?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d \u201cWhere\u2019s the house?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d", "\u201cUpstairs, downstairs, where was it?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know. But I had one beer, that\u2019s the only thing I remember.\u201d", "And a man\u2019s life is in tatters. A man\u2019s life is shattered. His wife is shattered. His daughters, who are beautiful, incredible young kids \u2014 they destroy people. They want to destroy people. These are really evil people.", "There is a lot wrong here, so let\u2019s go through Trump\u2019s statements one by one.", "Trump: \u201cUpstairs, downstairs, where was it?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d", "That\u2019s false. Ford testified that the alleged assault happened in a bedroom upstairs, while she was on her way to the upstairs bathroom.", "\u201cEarly in the evening, I went up a very narrow set of stairs leading from the living room to a second floor to use the restroom,\u201d she told the Senate Judiciary Committee. \u201cWhen I got to the top of the stairs, I was pushed from behind into a bedroom across from the bathroom. I couldn\u2019t see who pushed me. Brett and Mark [Judge] came into the bedroom and locked the door behind them.\u201d", "Trump:\u00a0\u201cHow many years ago was it?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know.\u201d", "That\u2019s false.\u00a0As we have written before, Ford has said the alleged incident occurred in the summer of 1982. And that\u2019s what she told Congress, too, under oath.", "\u201cIn the summer of 1982, like most summers, I spent most every day at the Columbia Country Club in Chevy Chase, Maryland, swimming and practicing diving,\u201d she testified. \u201cOne evening that summer, after a day of diving at the club, I attended a small gathering at a house in the Bethesda area.\u201d", "Trump: \u201cWhat neighborhood was it in?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d \u201cWhere\u2019s the house?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d", "This is misleading. Ford did not provide the exact location, but she told the committee that the alleged assault happened at a home in the Bethesda area near the Columbia Country Club.", "Trump: \u201cBut I had one beer, that\u2019s the only thing I remember.\u201d", "Ford did say she had only one beer. But, as we have already begun to lay out, Ford remembered a lot of details about the alleged assault.", "In addition to recalling what year the alleged attack occurred, where in the house it occurred and what town it occurred in, Ford gave specific details about the night of the alleged attack that Trump ignored.", "She said who was at the party. \u201cBrett Kavanaugh, Mark Judge, a boy named P.J., and one other boy whose name I cannot recall. I also remember my friend Leland attending,\u201d Ford testified, referring to\u00a0Patrick J. Smyth and Leland Ingham Keyser. All four people named by Ford say they do not recall being at the party, as we have written before. Ford addressed this in her testimony.", "\u201cI don\u2019t expect that P.J. and Leland would remember this evening,\u201d Ford said during her testimony. \u201cIt was a very unremarkable party. It was not one of their more notorious parties, because nothing remarkable happened to them that evening. They were downstairs.\u00a0And Mr. Judge is a different story. I would expect that he would remember that this happened.\u201d", "Ford, of course, has accused Judge of participating in the attack \u2014 which he denies.", "In her testimony, Ford said those at the party were drinking beer \u201cin a small living room/family room-type area on the first floor of the house.\u201d She said Kavanaugh and Judge \u201cwere visibly drunk.\u201d After pushing her into a second-floor bedroom when she was on her way to the bathroom, Kavanaugh or Judge allegedly locked the door and turned up the music.", "Ford, Sept. 27:\u00a0I was pushed onto the bed, and Brett got on top of me. He began running his hands over my body and grinding into me. I yelled, hoping that someone downstairs might hear me, and I tried to get away from him, but his weight was heavy.", "Brett groped me and tried to take off my clothes. He had a hard time, because he was very inebriated, and because I was wearing a one-piece bathing suit underneath my clothing.\u00a0I believed he was going to rape me.", "I tried to yell for help. When I did, Brett put his hand over my mouth to stop me from yelling. This is what terrified me the most, and has had the most lasting impact on my life. It was hard for me to breathe, and I thought that Brett was accidentally going to kill me.", "She recalled them \u201cdrunkenly laughing during the attack,\u201d and that Judge \u201cseemed ambivalent\u201d about the incident, \u201cat times urging Brett on and at times telling him to stop.\u201d", "She testified that she was able to escape the room when Judge jumped onto the bed while Kavanaugh was on top of her.", "Sen. Dick Durbin asked how sure she was of the identity of her attacker. \u201cDr. Ford, with what degree of certainty do you believe Brett Kavanaugh assaulted you?\u201d Durbin asked. She replied, \u201c100 percent.\u201d During his testimony, Kavanaugh was equally certain that the attack never occurred.", "In addition to providing details about the night of the alleged attack, Ford testified that she ran into Judge \u201conce at the Potomac Village Safeway after the time of the attack.\u201d", "Ford described Judge as an acquaintance, saying they \u201chad previously been friendly at the times that we saw each other over the previous two years.\u201d At the supermarket \u2014 \u201cthe one on the corner of Falls and River Road\u201d \u2014 Ford recalled saying \u201chello\u201d to him, and that Judge was \u201cnervous\u201d and he was \u201cvery uncomfortable saying \u2018hello\u2019 back.\u201d", "In a press briefing on Oct. 3, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said that the president \u201cwas stating facts that Dr. Ford, herself, laid out in her testimony.\u201d Sen. Lindsey Graham echoed those comments, saying during an interview that \u201ceverything he said was factual.\u201d", "Sanders was asked by a reporter: \u201cHe seemed to be, to the delight of the crowd there in Mississippi, mocking her repeatedly. Isn\u2019t there something wrong with the president of the United States mocking somebody who says she was sexually assaulted?\u201d", "She responded:", "Sanders, Oct. 3: It seemed to me that he was stating facts that Dr. Ford, herself, laid out in her testimony. Once again, every single word that Judge Kavanaugh has said has been looked at, examined, picked apart by most of you in this room, but not \u2014 no one is looking at whether or not the accusations made are corroborated, whether or not there\u2019s evidence to support them.", "Every person that she named has come out and said either they didn\u2019t recall it, or it didn\u2019t happen, or they weren\u2019t there. Every single bit of evidence and facts that we\u2019ve seen in this moment have supported Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s case. And the president is simply pointing out the facts of the matter. And that is what the Senate will have to use to determine whether or not they vote to support him or not.", "Graham, a Republican senator from South Carolina, was interviewed on stage at The Atlantic Festival, an event hosted by The Atlantic magazine and The Aspen Institute, on Oct. 3. Graham said: \u201cEverything he said was factual. He\u2019s frustrated his nominee has been treated so badly.\u201d", "\u201cPresident Trump went through a factual rendition that I didn\u2019t particularly like and I would tell him, \u2018Knock it off, you\u2019re not helping.\u2019 But it can be worse,\u201d\u00a0Graham said, going on to make references to sexual assault accusations against former President Bill Clinton in the 1990s.", "In the press briefing, Sanders later said again that \u201cthe president is simply stating the facts that she laid out in her own testimony and that the prosecutor laid out in her memo.\u201d But Trump wasn\u2019t \u201csimply stating the facts\u201d of Ford\u2019s testimony, as we have explained.", "Rachel Mitchell, a prosecutor with experience in sex crimes cases\u00a0hired by Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee to question Ford during the hearing, wrote a Sept. 30 memo detailing some inconsistencies or gaps in Ford\u2019s memory. But\u00a0if the president was simply relaying Mitchell\u2019s memo, he didn\u2019t do so accurately.", "For instance,\u00a0Mitchell\u2019s memo says Ford has given slightly different dates for when the attack happened, noting a July 6 text to the Washington Post from Ford said the attack was in the \u201cmid 1980s\u201d but Ford\u2019s July 30 letter to Sen. Dianne Feinstein said \u201cearly 80s.\u201d In the Sept. 16 Washington Post article, Ford said it was the \u201csummer of 1982.\u201d Mitchell says in the memo that \u201cit is common for victims to be uncertain about dates.\u201d But she says, \u201cDr. Ford failed to explain how she was suddenly able to narrow the timeframe to a particular season and particular year.\u201d", "Ford gave a general time frame of the 1980s and then narrowed that to 1982. She didn\u2019t say, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d", "Trump also claimed that Ford didn\u2019t know what neighborhood the house was in. But that goes beyond what Mitchell says in the memo.", "\u201cShe does not remember in what house the assault allegedly took place or where that house was located with any specificity,\u201d Mitchell wrote. But also says, \u201cShe told the Washington Post that the party took place near the Columbia Country Club.\u201d\u00a0She told the committee the same thing.", "Mitchell said that this is one detail that \u201ccould help corroborate her account.\u201d It would also help if Ford could recall how she got to and home from the party, Mitchell said.", "During her testimony, Ford acknowledged, \u201cI don\u2019t have all the answers, and I don\u2019t remember as much as I would like to.\u201d But, she said, certain experiences from that night \u201chave been seared into my memory, and have haunted me episodically as an adult.\u201d", "Ford \u2014 a research psychologist at Stanford University who has co-authored papers on brain science\u00a0\u2014 gave the senators a lesson on the hippocampus, which is a critical part of the brain\u2019s ability to process certain traumatic experiences into indelible memories.", "Asked how she can be certain that Kavanaugh was her attacker, Ford said, \u201cIt\u2019s \u2014 just basic memory functions. And also just the level of norepinephrine and epinephrine in the brain that, sort of, as you know, encodes \u2014 that neurotransmitter encodes memories into the hippocampus. And so, the trauma-related experience, then, is kind of locked there, whereas other details kind of drift.\u201d", "She said her most vivid memory of the event was \u201cthe uproarious laughter between the two, and their having fun at my expense.\u201d", "Experts on sexual assault told us it is not unusual at all for victims to have clear memory of some details and no memory of others.", "\u201cMemory is not like a videotape that you can play back again,\u201d said Dean G. Kilpatrick, director of the National Crime Victims Research and Treatment Center at the Medical University of South Carolina.", "\u201cPeople tend to remember things that are salient to them in some way,\u201d Kilpatrick told us in a phone interview. \u201cThings that are good or bad tend to stand out.\u201d", "With traumatic memories, he said, salient details tend to get locked in while other central details, like how Ford got to the house that night, would not be remembered.", "\u201cGaps in Dr. Ford\u2019s memory of that night is not unusual, based on what we know regarding memory and trauma,\u201d said Kathryn Bell, an associate professor of psychology at Capital University in Columbus, Ohio. \u201cMemory decay associated with time passing can impact a person\u2019s ability to recall certain details of an event. Furthermore, during a traumatic event, neurobiological changes can occur in response to stress, which can impact how memories of the event are consolidated. \u2026", "\u201cDuring a traumatic event, attentional resources are directed towards the immediate threat \u2014 this can result in the person being able to vividly recall certain details of the event while being unable to recall other aspects of the event,\u201d Bell told us via email. \u201cIn the trauma and memory literature, this is referred to as memory fragmentation. Those vivid traumatic memories encoded to long-term memory during the event may be recalled easily by trauma survivors for months or even years after the traumatic event occurred.\u201d", "In an article published in Scientific American on Sept. 27, psychologist Jim Hopper, an expert on traumatic memory and a teaching associate at Harvard Medical School wrote: \u201cIncomplete memories of sexual assault, including those with huge gaps, are\u00a0understandable\u00a0\u2013 if we learn the basics of how memory works and we genuinely listen to survivors.\u201d", "\u201cWe remember what is significant to us,\u201d Hopper told us in a phone interview. \u201cIt was significant to her that she had a hand over her mouth, that there was loud music and that they were laughing at her. These are all things that were important to her, and so were burned into her memory.\u201d", "Hopper said the brain is set up to prioritize memory in such ways. And so, he said, Ford remembers exiting the house, that they were not coming after her, and that she did not want to appear as if anything had happened to her, because those were significant to her.", "\u201cThose are just the kinds of things we\u2019d expect to be significant,\u201d he said.", "There is also a well-established biological reason why she might not remember how she got home, Hopper said.", "When people are faced with stress or fear, he said, at first the brain kicks into a super-encoding mode that allows the brain to burn in those significant details. But that state is not sustainable neurobiologically, and is followed, likely within 20 minutes after the traumatic event began, by a period of the brain being in a minimal-encoding mode, during which there is an extremely reduced ability to store any information. You would expect, he said, that just such a state would have hit Ford sometime shortly after the traumatic event. And so, he said, it is understandable that she would not recall how she got home.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
