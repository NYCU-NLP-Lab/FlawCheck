The FBI operation, called Crossfire Hurricane, targeted four men within the Trump campaign orbit, including campaign manager Paul Manafort and national security adviser Michael Flynn.", "That FBI investigation itself has been the subject of investigations by the Justice Department and Congress.", "Not one found that Obama initiated or meddled in the FBI\u2019s work. Not one concluded that the FBI lacked good reason to launch the investigation.", "\"There is not a shred of evidence that it was directed by the White House,\" said Robert Litt, former general counsel for the Director of National Intelligence in the Obama administration.", "A recent Senate Intelligence Committee report, approved by both Republicans and Democrats, said bluntly that the Russian government interfered with the goal of seeing Trump win. One key Russian tactic was the hack into the Democratic National Committee email server and the release through WikiLeaks of material to embarrass the Hillary Clinton campaign.", "\"Moscow's intent was to harm the Clinton Campaign, tarnish an expected Clinton presidential administration, help the Trump Campaign after Trump became the presumptive Republican nominee, and undermine the U.S. democratic process,\" the report said.", "The Senate report said that Manafort \"sought to secretly share internal campaign information with (Konstantin) Kilimnik.\" It called Kilimnik \"a Russian intelligence officer.\"", "The report also concluded that Trump spoke with political operative Roger Stone about Stone\u2019s access to WikiLeaks, something Trump denies ever took place.

According to secondhand notes from someone who wasn\u2019t in the room, in a meeting with Comey, Obama indicated that the FBI \"should look at things and have the right people on it.\"", "There is no legal definition of spying. The FBI investigated four people with greater or lesser roles in the Trump campaign. One of them, Carter Page, was the subject of electronic surveillance, which rates as highly intrusive in the FBI rule book.", "That didn\u2019t happen until October 2016, after Page\u2019s name was already in the news and the Trump campaign said publicly it had no connection with him. And the FBI had tracked Page before Trump announced his White House run.", "Litt said the closest the FBI came to spying was in August 2016 when it briefed the Trump campaign on its investigation into Russian interference. Among the briefing team was an FBI agent who went, as the Inspector General\u2019s report noted, because he knew national security adviser Flynn would be there. And Flynn was targeted.", "For the rest of it, Litt said there is \"no indication that this was anything other than an adequately predicated counterintelligence investigation.\"", "There is one more review in the works. Attorney General William Barr tasked Connecticut\u2019s U.S. Attorney John Durham to dig into the origins of the FBI\u2019s investigation. That report is expected before the election.", "Trump said Obama \"spied on my campaign, and got caught!\"", "Multiple independent investigations, including a series of bipartisan Senate reports, found no political influence over the FBI investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election.
