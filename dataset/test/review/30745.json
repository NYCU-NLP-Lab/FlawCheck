The letters reminded voters, \"Elections officials will never come to your house to pick up your absentee ballot or tell you how to vote,\" and asked those with tips to call the board.", "On Jan. 17, Woodhouse tweeted about what he referred to as \"huge news\" about the investigation.", "The elections board \"sent (a) letter to every person requesting a mail ballot in Bladen, (but) received no calls to the hotline number provided,\" Woodhouse\u00a0tweeted\u00a0on Jan. 17.", "Is it true that no one from Bladen County called the state elections board with tips? No. Here\u2019s how the mix-up happened.", "A FACEBOOK POST", "When Woodhouse tweeted his claim, he linked to the Facebook page of Stony Rushing, a Republican Union County commissioner. Rushing encouraged reporters to find out how many people called the elections board hotline \u2014 but he didn\u2019t claim to have official information on the number of calls received.", "\"If the total number of calls exceed 905 votes (the number of votes Harris leads McCready) then let\u2019s talk new elections,\"\u00a0Rushing posted on Facebook. \"I will bet the total number of voters who called them before November 6th from this letter is less than 10 and closer to 0.\"", "(This argument makes it seem like, to order a new election, the elections board needs to prove that at least 905 ballots were destroyed or altered.
