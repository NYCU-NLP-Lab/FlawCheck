Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez had complained that \u201cwe pay soldiers too much.\u201d Among the people who may have not \u201cunderstood\u201d this post was satire was a police officer in Louisiana who shared the story on Facebook with a threat against Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s life, writing: \u201cThis vile idiot needs a round ... and I don\u2019t mean the kind she used to serve.\u201d That officer, and another who liked his statement on Facebook, were fired on July 22 after news media reports exposed the posts.", "This Kaepernick post, shared thousands of times on Facebook, is no different. As one example, the \u201cBeBest\u201d post was shared to a Facebook group supportive of conservative activist Candace Owen.
