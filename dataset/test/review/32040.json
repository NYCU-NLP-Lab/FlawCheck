["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on November 14, 2019", "Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a Ukraine expert working in the White House, was not fired by President Donald Trump \u2014 as posts circulating online continue to perpetuate. The confusion was born out of a recent television interview with Trump\u2019s national security adviser.", "A Nov. 10 television interview with President Donald Trump\u2019s national security adviser prompted confusion about whether Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman \u2014 a key witness in the impeachment inquiry into Trump \u2014 had been removed from his role at the White House.", "But the White House and Vindman\u2019s attorney soon after corrected the record and made clear that Vindman is still in his position on the National Security Council.", "Content circulating on social media, however, has continued to perpetuate the erroneous claim that Trump \u201cfired\u201d Vindman over Veterans Day weekend in retaliation for his testimony.", "A meme, which lifted the text from a tweet, claims \u201cTrump has fired Lt Col Vindman \u2026 an abuse of power and another impeachable offense. Trump retaliated against an American patriot, on Veteran\u2019s Day weekend. Disgusting and pathetic.\u201d", "Vindman, a Ukraine expert detailed to the White House\u2019s National Security Council, testified behind closed doors before the House committees conducting the impeachment inquiry into Trump on Oct. 29. Vindman was among those assigned to listen in on Trump\u2019s July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. During the call, which is at the heart of the impeachment inquiry, Trump suggested Ukraine conduct certain investigations, including one into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, who served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.", "In his prepared opening statement, Vindman told the House committees that he \u201cdid not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen, and I was worried about the implications for the U.S. government\u2019s support of Ukraine.\u201d", "\u201cI realized that if Ukraine pursued an investigation into the Bidens and Burisma, it would likely be interpreted as a partisan play which would undoubtedly result in Ukraine losing the bipartisan support it has thus far maintained,\u201d the statement continued. \u201cThis would all undermine U.S. national security.\u201d", "In a Nov. 10 interview on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d anchor Margaret Brennan asked National Security Adviser Robert O\u2019Brien if Vindman would continue in his position after his testimony.", "Brennan, Nov. 10: Lt. Col. Vindman, who has testified under oath, is serving on the National Security Council currently. Will he continue to work for you despite testifying against the president?", "O\u2019Brien: Well \u2014 well look, one of the things that I\u2019ve talked about is that we\u2019re streamlining the National Security Council. It got bloated to like 236 people from \u2014 up from 100 in the Bush administration under President Obama. We\u2019re streamlining the National Security Council. There are people that are detailed from different departments and agencies. My understanding is he\u2019s, is that Col. Vindman is detailed from the Department of Defense. So everyone who\u2019s detailed at the NSC, people are going to start going back to their own departments and we\u2019ll bring in new folks. But we\u2019re going to get that number down to around 100 people. That\u2019s what it was under Condoleezza Rice. She came and met with me. I met with a number of my successors.", "Brennan: Right.", "O\u2019Brien: We don\u2019t need to recreate the Department of Defense, the Department of State, the Department of Homeland Security over at the White House. We\u2019ve got great diplomats and soldiers and folks that can \u2014 that do that work for us in the departments.", "Brennan then attempted to solicit a more clear response.", "Brennan: Just to button that up, though. You\u2019re saying Lt. Col. Vindman is scheduled to rotate out. You are not suggesting in any way that there will be retaliation against him?", "O\u2019Brien: I never retaliated against anyone. So the \u2026", "Brennan: But his time is coming to an end?", "O\u2019Brien: There will be a point for everybody who\u2019s detailed there \u2026", "Brennan: Okay.", "O\u2019Brien: \u2026 that their time, that their detail will come to an end. They\u2019ll go back to their agency. And what we want them to do is take the experience and skills they learned at the White House, take it back to their departments and agencies and do an even better job there. And so we\u2019re grateful that we can have these detailees come in, and they\u2019ll come spend the year \u2014 a year or, you know, maybe a little bit more at the White House and then they\u2019ll go back to their agency. And they\u2019ll do a better job at their agency.", "This exchange caused some to believe that Vindman was indeed being removed from the National Security Council. The \u201cFace the Nation\u201d Twitter account posted a tweet about the interview that began, \u201cVINDMAN OUT AT NSC.\u201d", "But Vindman\u2019s attorney, Michael Volkov, later provided a statement to CBS, after the O\u2019Brien interview, that reads: \u201cLTC Vindman is still detailed to the National Security Council. His detail ends July 2020. We are not aware of any change in his status. Obviously any retaliatory action against LTC Vindman on a day when we honor our military heroes would be reprehensible.\u201d", "Volkov, in an email to FactCheck.org on Nov. 14, said that his statement to CBS still stood, and that Vindman will enter the U.S. Army War College after his detail at the NSC ends in mid-2020.", "\u201cHe continues to work at the NSC each day,\u201d Volkov told us. \u201cWe are monitoring the situation closely.\u201d", "Some of the memes circulating about the supposed firing credit text to Scott Dworkin \u2014 a\u00a0Democrat who opposes Trump and has a large Twitter following. Dworkin did tweet the text included in the meme, which claims that \u201cTrump has fired Lt Col Vindman\u201d and calls it \u201cdisgusting,\u201d but he also posted follow-up tweets with the correct information.", "Dworkin wrote in a subsequent tweet: \u201cNow it\u2019s being reported Vindman isn\u2019t being removed and is set to serve out his term.\u201d He later shared a Twitter thread from the editor of Talking Points Memo, a left-leaning website, that addressed some of the confusion.", "White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham also told the Washington Examiner after the O\u2019Brien interview that Vindman \u201cis still there.\u201d", "Vindman is expected to testify again in the impeachment inquiry, this time at a public hearing on Nov. 19.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media. Our previous stories can be found\u00a0here.", "Chaitlin, Daniel. \u201c\u2018Still there\u2019: White House denies Vindman fired in retribution for Ukraine testimony.\u201d Washington Examiner. 10 Nov 2019.", "\u201cOfficial who testified against Trump \u201cstill detailed\u201d to National Security Council.\u201d CBS News. 11 Nov 2019.", "\u201cTranscript: Robert O\u2019Brien on \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d November 10, 2019.\u201d CBS News. 10 Nov 2019.", "Volkov, Michael. Attorney. Email to FactCheck.org. 14 Nov 2019.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
