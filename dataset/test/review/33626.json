The faces of the girls were already blurred in the false posts.

AFP blackened out the name of the accused bully.", "However, clicking on the video leads viewers to a news report about an unrelated incident in 2016.", "The clip is a report from local news organization UNTV about the shooting of an unidentifed man. Here is the original.", "The actual video of the man making the challenge is widely available online, including this one.", "From 2:32-2:37, he says his name, adding he is on a vacation in the Philippines and will return to Canada.", "\u201cBy the way, my name is JP Otazu.

A spokesperson confirmed that the man in the photo is Otazu and the the reports on his death are false.", "\u201cI can confirm that Master Corporal Joseph Perez Otazu reported for duty today, January 8th, 2019, \u00a0after having spent some time on leave with family over the Christmas season.\u00a0Thus, the posts referring to his death are false\u201d, Lt.
