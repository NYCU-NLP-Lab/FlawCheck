I am not certain where he is now, but in 2013, he was living quietly in his villa with five of his wives and many children.\u201d", "Mr. Snowden says the CIA orchestrated the fake death of the former leader of Al Qaeda, while he was actually transported with his family in an undisclosed location in the Bahamas.", "\u201cOsama Bin Laden was one of the CIA\u2019s most efficient operatives for a long time,\u201d claims the famous whistleblower. \u201cWhat kind of message would it send their other operatives if they were to let the SEALs kill him? They organized his fake death with the collaboration of the Pakistani Secret services, and he simply abandoned his cover. Since everyone believes he is dead, nobody\u2019s looking for him, so it was pretty easy to disappear.
