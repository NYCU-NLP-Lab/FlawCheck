You don\u2019t have to worry about him.\"", "Then, Obama explained\u00a0to the Clinton supporters why they should respect this man.", "\"This is what I mean about folks not being focused,\" Obama said. \"First of all, we live in a country that respects free speech.

Vote. Don\u2019t boo. Vote.\"", "Obama doesn\u2019t yell at the protester. In fact, most of his defense is directed at the Clinton supporters.
