["About this rating", "In late January 2017, a statement from a fake Facebook profile for Vice President Mike Pence denouncing the Womens' March on Washington was mistakenly picked up as real news before being taken down.", "The fake profile, which called itself \"VPMikePence,\" claimed that \"well over half\" of the participants in the demonstrations on 21 January 2017 supported President Donald Trump. Though the page has since been deleted, it can be seen in cached form online.", "The New York Daily News picked up on the quote and built a story around it, while noting that none of its four reporters covering the local version of the march saw \"any evidence\" of significant support for the new president. That story was also deleted, but it is also available in cached form.", "Even before being deleted, \"VPMikePence\" had tipped its hand regarding its nature with a series of politically-aggressive posts:", "Pence does have his own certified Facebook page, as well as one he maintained while he was governor of Indiana.", "Though the statement and profile was bogus, we contacted organizers of the march seeking confirmation of any encounters with Trump supporters during the event. They have yet to respond.", "Arturo Garcia is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
