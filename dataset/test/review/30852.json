["By Lori Robertson, Eugene Kiely, Jessica McDonald and D'Angelo Gore", "Posted on November 30, 2020 | Updated on December 1, 2020", "In his first interview since Election Day, President Donald Trump recapped baseless, false and misleading claims he has made before of a \u201crigged\u201d election.", "Trump spoke by phone with Fox News\u2019 Maria Bartiromo on Nov. 29. In the interview, Trump went so far as to suggest the Department of Justice might be part of some grand conspiracy. \u201cThis is total fraud. And how the FBI and Department of Justice \u2014 I don\u2019t know. Maybe they\u2019re involved,\u201d Trump said.", "There\u2019s no evidence that Trump\u2019s loss of a second term is due to \u201cfraud.\u201d State and federal judges have rejected Trump\u2019s claims, saying the Trump legal team has provided no evidence of fraud, and election security officials have labeled this \u201cthe most secure in American history.\u201d", "Update, Dec. 1: Attorney General William Barr told the Associated Press on Dec. 1 that U.S. attorneys and the FBI have followed up on claims of fraud. \u201cTo date, we have not seen fraud on a scale that could have affected a different outcome in the election,\u201d Barr said.", "The president stuck to a conspiracy theory that Dominion Voting Systems had switched \u201cthousands of votes\u201d from him to President-elect Joe Biden, saying these were cases of \u201ctheft\u201d not \u201cglitches.\u201d A group of federal, state and local officials overseeing the nation\u2019s voting system refuted such claims back on Nov. 12, hours after Trump tweeted them.", "\u201cThere is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised,\u201d said the Elections Infrastructure Government Coordinating Council and the Election Infrastructure Sector Coordinating Executive Committees. The joint statement from the groups described the 2020 election as \u201cthe most secure in American history.\u201d", "That statement was distributed by Trump\u2019s own government: the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security. Five days after that statement, Trump fired the head of CISA, Christopher Krebs.", "In a Nov. 29 interview on CBS\u2019 \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d Krebs, a Republican, reiterated that claims about election software or systems being hacked are \u201cnonsense.\u201d He said that the use of paper ballots, which increased in 2020 compared with 2016, gives officials the ability to \u201ccheck the tape.\u201d", "\u201cThat gives you the ability to prove that there was no malicious algorithm or hacked software that adjusted the tally of the vote, and just look at what happened in Georgia,\u201d Krebs said. \u201cGeorgia has machines that tabulate the vote. They then held a hand recount and the outcome was consistent with the machine vote.\u201d", "When Trump tweeted about \u201cdeleted\u201d or \u201cswitched\u201d votes on Nov. 12, we found his claims could be traced back to an anonymous post on a pro-Trump message board.", "Kay Stimson, Dominion Voting Systems\u2019 vice president for governmental affairs, told us in an email then that its technology, certified by 28 states, didn\u2019t cause any vote switching. \u201cDominion Voting Systems categorically denies any claims about any vote switching or alleged software issues with our voting systems,\u201d Stimson said. \u201cOur systems continue to reliably and accurately count ballots, and state and local election authorities have publicly confirmed the integrity of the process.\u201d", "Dominion Voting Systems, which is based in Denver, has a webpage dedicated to rebutting bogus rumors about its equipment and technology. It reiterates that claims about deleting or switching votes are \u201ccompletely false.\u201d", "But Trump repeated them to Bartiromo anyway:", "Trump: You start with these machines that have been suspect, not allowed to be used in Texas, the Dominion machines, where tremendous reports have been put out.", "We have affidavits on \u2014 from many people talking about what went on with machines. They had glitches. \u2026", "Well, no, we had glitches where they moved thousands of votes from my account to Biden\u2019s account. And these are glitches. So, they\u2019re not glitches. They\u2019re theft. They\u2019re fraud, absolute fraud.\u00a0And there were many of them, but, obviously, most of them tremendous amounts, got by without us catching. \u2026", "I think we caught four or five glitches of about 5,000 votes each, and different states. And, again, they\u2019re not glitches. That was fraud. And they got caught.", "There were no such glitches. \u201cNo credible reports or evidence of any software issues exist,\u201d Dominion Voting Systems says.", "The election results \u201care 100% auditable,\u201d the company says.", "There were a few cases of human errors that were quickly corrected. We wrote about one case in Shiawassee County, Michigan, in which a typo led to a brief, large uptick in votes for Biden. It was quickly caught and corrected.", "The\u00a0New York Times\u00a0investigated five cases \u2014 not all of them in counties using Dominion software \u2014 and found that they were all promptly detected and corrected. \u201cIn all of the cases, software did not affect the vote counts,\u201d the Times reported.", "Update, Dec. 1: Attorney General Barr told the Associated Press: \u201cThere\u2019s been one assertion that would be systemic fraud and that would be the claim that machines were programmed essentially to skew the election results. And the DHS and DOJ have looked into that, and so far, we haven\u2019t seen anything to substantiate that.\u201d", "As for Texas, the state has declined to certify Dominion systems. Dominion says: \u201cWhile we disagree with Texas\u2019 decision to not certify our systems, we understand there are different standards in different states. Sometimes it takes adjustments, for any company\u2019s systems, to meet a certain state\u2019s standard.\u201d", "In the Fox News interview, Trump also falsely claimed, \u201cYou know, the votes in Dominion, they say, are counted in foreign countries, OK?\u201d Whoever says this is wrong.", "\u201cVote counts are conducted by county and state election officials, not by Dominion,\u201d the company says.", "On \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d Krebs was asked specifically about this false claim by Trump and others. \u201cSo all votes in the United States of America are counted in the United States of America,\u201d he said. \u201cI don`t\u2013 I don`t understand this claim. All votes in the United States of America are counted in the United States of America. Period.\u201d", "Trump also repeated his false claim to have \u201cwon\u201d on Election Night, despite the fact that several states hadn\u2019t counted enough ballots at that point to project a winner.", "Trump:\u00a0And what happened, if you watched the election, I was called by the biggest people, saying, congratulations, political people. Congratulations, sir. You just won the election. It was 10:00. And you looked at the numbers. And I\u2019m sure you felt that way.", "This election was over. And then they did dumps. They call them dumps, big, massive dumps, in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and all over. \u2026", "And they did these massive dumps of votes. And, all of a sudden, I went from winning by a lot to losing by a little. And, in some cases, it took a period of time to do it. North Carolina, they couldn\u2019t do it. I won North Carolina. They couldn\u2019t \u2014 somehow, they had a better system. But they couldn\u2019t do anything. I believe they tried.", "As we\u2019ve written before, it was no surprise that Trump\u2019s lead in some states dwindled, or was erased, as more votes were counted because those states counted in-person votes first and mail-in votes later. Democrats were more likely to vote by mail.", "State laws in Pennsylvania and Michigan prohibited election officials from counting mail-in ballots until Election Day.\u00a0Pennsylvania could not even begin pre-canvassing \u2014 opening envelopes and preparing the ballots to be counted \u2014 until 7 a.m. on Election Day,\u00a0Pennsylvania Secretary of the Commonwealth Kathy Boockvar said at a virtual seminar\u00a0held Oct. 20 by the Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation at Harvard University.", "At the time, she said that the majority of ballots wouldn\u2019t be counted until Friday, Nov. 6. In fact, the state hadn\u2019t counted enough ballots for media outlets to project Biden the winner until Nov. 7.", "The president repeated the unsubstantiated claim that \u201cthousands\u201d of dead people voted in the election.", "\u201cDead people were seeing ballots,\u201d Trump said, speaking of mail-in ballots. \u201cBut, even worse, dead people were applying to get a ballot. They were making application to get ballots, many. And, you know, we\u2019re not talking about 10 people. We\u2019re talking \u2014 there are a lot of dead people that so-called voted in this election.\u201d", "\u201cBut dead people were, in some cases, in many, many cases, thousands of cases, voted, but, also, dead people made application to vote,\u201d he continued. \u201cThey were dead 10 years, 15 years, and they actually made application.\u201d", "As\u00a0we\u2019ve\u00a0written, allegations of dead people voting cropped up shortly after the election, particularly in Pennsylvania, which Biden won\u00a0by more than 80,000 votes. But there is no evidence of such voting fraud on any large scale.", "Election experts\u00a0previously told us\u00a0that while on occasion these types of fraudulent incidents occur, they are rare \u2014 and frequently, alleged cases of dead people voting can be explained by list-matching or administrative errors, such as confusing two people with identical or similar names.", "One\u00a0purported dead voter\u00a0in Michigan, for example, was a case of mistaken identity. In a\u00a0lawsuit\u00a0filed by the Trump campaign, which has since been\u00a0voluntarily withdrawn, a mother claimed that she saw records stating that her deceased son had voted after he died. Voting records in the state, however, show that her son did not vote after he died and his registration had been appropriately canceled. The state suspects that the mother saw records for another person with her son\u2019s name.", "In Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, a registered Republican attempted\u00a0to apply for a mail-in ballot under his deceased mother\u2019s name in October \u2014 but was caught, and charged with felonies.", "Trump once again falsely said that Republicans weren\u2019t allowed to have poll watchers and incorrectly claimed to have pictures and evidence \u201cof new ballots being brought into counting rooms.\u201d That could be a reference to a viral video of a man unloading camera equipment \u2014 not ballots.", "Trump:\u00a0You know, the poll watchers \u2014 and this is true with all of the states, just about, that you\u2019re talking about, I think all of them. They weren\u2019t allowed to have poll watchers. The Democrats and thugs, thugs \u2014 I\u2019m not talking about saying, could you please move over? They threw them out of the counting rooms. They weren\u2019t allowed to be in. They threw them outside in many cases.", "You heard the story where the people, they went out and sent for binoculars, because they wouldn\u2019t allow them to watch. And during that period of time, a lot of bad things happened. Then they closed \u2014 as you know, they closed up the voting, and then for \u2014 unexpectedly. They closed up all of the counting.", "Unexpectedly, new ballots came in. And it was all new numbers being added. We have pictures and we have evidence of new ballots being brought into counting rooms.", "Trump and his campaign have\u00a0frequently pointed\u00a0to issues related to election observer access in lawsuits, but it\u2019s not true that Republicans were not permitted to have observers.", "In Pennsylvania, for example, the dispute was about how close the observers could get to poll workers, as we\u2019ve\u00a0written. And in another case, a Trump lawyer even admitted during a hearing that the campaign did have some canvassing observers present when he said, \u201cThere\u2019s a nonzero number of people in the room.\u201d", "The Trump campaign also\u00a0alleged that it did not have \u201cmeaningful opportunity\u201d to observe ballot counting in Detroit, but later withdrew its suit. There is no evidence\u00a0that at any time there weren\u2019t Republican observers present.", "The president\u2019s other comments also appear to refer to Detroit\u2019s TCF Center, which on the afternoon of Nov. 4 temporarily barred\u00a0some election observers of both parties from entering because of capacity limits.", "The unexpected arrival of \u201cnew ballots being brought into counting rooms\u201d could be a reference to an already debunked viral video from a conservative website showing a man unloading a black box from a white van and putting it into a wagon that was wheeled into the counting center.", "The implication is that the box contained ballots, but as we\u2019ve explained\u00a0before, it was camera equipment. Ross Jones, an investigative reporter for WXYZ-TV, Detroit\u2019s ABC affiliate, said on Twitter: \u201cThe \u2018ballot thief\u2019 was my photographer. He was bringing down equipment for our 12-hour shift.\u201d", "Trump claimed that \u201ca lot of ballots\u201d included votes only for Biden and no other down-ballot candidates, citing this as evidence of fraud. But Trump\u2019s logic is flawed.", "Trump:\u00a0As you know, there were a lot of ballots where it was just Biden on top. They didn\u2019t do anything else, because they were in a rush. And from what everybody is saying, and from what \u2014 I don\u2019t think we even have to prove this. They say that I was doing so much better than they thought that they panicked, and they started just doing ballot after ballot very quickly and just checking the Biden name on top. They didn\u2019t have time.", "So, you have all these ballots with just one name checked. People don\u2019t vote that way.", "It is true that Biden won more votes than Democrats running in other races. For example, Biden received about\u00a0100,000 more votes\u00a0in Georgia than Democratic Senate candidate Jon Ossoff. But that doesn\u2019t mean \u2014 as Trump campaign adviser Steve Cortes\u00a0has claimed\u00a0\u2014 that those ballots contained votes only for Biden and no other down-ballot candidate.", "When asked to comment on similar claims about \u201cBiden-only\u201d voting in Georgia,\u00a0Barry Burden, director of the Elections Research Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison,\u00a0told us\u00a0it is not possible to know how many Georgians voted for Biden and no other candidate. That \u201cwould require individual-level information from ballots, not aggregation information about ballots cast in each race,\u201d he said.", "Instead, Biden\u2019s better performance than Ossoff in Georgia is likely because of ticket-splitting, when a voter picks a presidential candidate of one party and a Senate candidate of another party, and \u201cballot roll-off,\u201d which is when voters skip certain races.", "Burden\u00a0told us\u00a0it\u2019s not unusual for voters to \u201cchoose a candidate at the top of the ballot and then \u2018roll off\u2019 as they move down the ballot. There is nothing suspicious about lower participation in lower level races.\u201d", "The president claimed that \u201cmany ballots with the name Trump on were thrown out.\u201d But there is no evidence that\u00a0any\u00a0ballots legally cast for Trump were not counted.", "\u201cMany ballots with the name Trump on were thrown out. You have read that,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey found ballots in a river with the name Trump on from the military. They were signed. And they were floating in a river. They found ballots under rocks that had the name Trump on. They were signed. They were signed with Trump.\u201d", "Trump had been making this claim even\u00a0before the Nov. 3 election.\u00a0But there is only one instance of Trump votes \u2014 seven of them \u2014 accidentally being tossed out.\u00a0It happened in September, when the Justice Department announced that\u00a0nine military ballots\u00a0\u2014 seven cast for Trump \u2014 were found in a trash can in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania.", "A state election official said the ballots were discarded in error,\u00a0according to\u00a0the\u00a0Times Leader\u00a0of Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. In the end, all nine votes were counted, the paper\u00a0reported.", "Trump made the baseless and contradictory claim that Republicans cannot win with mail-in voting. \u201cAnd, by the way,\u201d he said, \u201cif Republicans allow it to happen, you\u2019ll never have another Republican elected in the history of this country at a Senate level or at a presidential level. You\u2019ll never \u2014 or at a House level.\u201d", "In fact, Republicans fared surprisingly well in the Senate and House races, despite the\u00a0record number\u00a0of mail-in ballots and Biden\u2019s\u00a0strong performance\u00a0at the top of the ticket.", "The Republicans, so far, won 11\u00a0House races\u00a0and lost just three for a net gain of eight, according to CNN.", "In the Senate, the Republicans had nearly twice as many\u00a0seats to defend\u00a0(23) than the Democrats (12), but so far have had a\u00a0net loss of only one seat. The Republicans may be able to\u00a0keep control\u00a0of the Senate, if they win at least one of the two Senate runoff races in Georgia.", "Editor\u2019s note:\u00a0FactCheck.org does not accept advertising.
