It occurs as part of a rare congenital disorder called diprosopus where the trunk and limbs are normal but there is a partial or complete duplication of different parts of the face. It is also considered as a variety of conjoined twins (Bhuyan, M et al. 2018). Babies with this disorder are usually stillborn (born dead) as this disorder is often associated with deformities of the brain, spinal cord, heart and abdominal organs (Yahaya, R.S et al. 2018).", "It is important to note that such deformities of duplication of body organs do not appear without disfigurement. Any picture or video of precisely placed extra body parts on a body with no disfigurement is unlikely to be real. Furthermore, in the case of diprosopus, there are multiple parts of the face that are duplicated resulting in a grossly deformed face.
