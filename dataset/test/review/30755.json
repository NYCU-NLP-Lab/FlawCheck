["\u201cWisdom from Dr Henry,\u201d says one version of the post, while another calls it \u201cwonderful advice.\u201d.

Instead, she recommends referring to the excellent guidance found on the BC Centre for Disease Control\u2019s website,\u201d the spokesperson added.", "A keyword search revealed that a similar version of the advice was shared as early as May 14, 2020 by this Pakistani website which attributed the text to Dr Faheem Younus, Chief of Infectious Diseases at the University of Maryland Upper Chesapeake Health. He also disowned the advice, saying \u201cthese are not my words.\u201d", "Some of the advice in the post is legitimate.
