Variations of the claim can also be found here, here and here.", "The claims refers to thalidomide, a sedative that caused a health scandal that emerged in 1962, after pharmaceutical companies had marketed the drug in nearly 50 countries. Scientists found a connection between the drug and severe birth defects in thousands of babies.", "But the development of the drug cannot be compared to the modern scientific process surrounding the development of a vaccine for Covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.", "\u201cIn the 1950s, scientists did not know that the effects of a drug could be passed through the placental barrier and harm a fetus in the womb, so the use of medications during pregnancy was not strictly controlled,\u201d the Science Museum of London explains on a webpage dedicated to the history of the drug.", "The US also did not authorize the marketing and distribution of the drug in its territory.", "Dr. Frances Kelsey, a medical officer responsible for licenses at the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) at the time, refused to approve the application of thalidomide because of \u201cits inadequate evidence,\u201d and despite \u201cconstant pressure\u201d from the pharmaceutical company.", "The medical disaster represents a milestone in the history of the agency, as it led to increased support for tighter drug regulation and research on side-effects.", "The research around Covid-19 vaccines is \u201cworlds different from what was done with thalidomide,\u201d said Dr Susan Ellenberg, professor of biostatistics, medical ethics and health policy at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Perelman School of Medicine.", "\u201cThalidomide was studied in an era when there was very little in terms of regulatory requirements for drug approval,\u201d she told AFP in a phone interview. \u201cWhatever trials were done, they weren\u2019t even required, they were very small.\u201d", "For the first US approval of a Covid-19 vaccine, the FDA granted an \u201cemergency use authorization (EUA)\u201d to manufacturers Pfizer and BioNTech in order to respond more rapidly to the public health crisis.", "The country began rolling out the Pfizer vaccine on December 14, hoping to have 20 million people immunized by the end of the month.", "On December 17, independent experts met again, this time to recommend the approval of another Covid-19 vaccine developed by the biotech company Moderna, expected to become the second one allowed in the country.", "According to Ellenberg, the exceptional interest in the worldwide pandemic also contributed in accelerating the development of the vaccine: \u201cIt was not hard to sign people up\u201d for the trial.", "\u201cTypically, you would not have entered thirty thousand people in a clinical trial over a period of two or three months,\u201d she explained, while it more often takes a year to gather the amount of people required for drawing conclusions about the study.", "FDA Commissioner Stephen\u00a0Hahn said that \u201cefficiency does not mean any cutting of corners. Medical products are still undergoing rigorous study and clinical trials.\u201d", "\u201cImportant safety checks remain in place.
