I mean, our doctors are very smart people. So what they do is they say, \u2018I'm sorry, but, you know, everybody dies of COVID.\u2019\"", "This is a persistent theory that lacks any proof.", "Johns Hopkins University researchers reported that the virus has killed more than 230,000 people. There is no evidence that figure is exaggerated. If anything, public health analysts say it likely undercounts the reach of the disease.", "And while the government offers 20% more for the care of Medicare patients with COVID-19, the majority of doctors work for hospital systems. That means whatever higher payments might come, they don't go to them.", "In order for Trump\u2019s claim to have an appreciable impact on reported deaths, thousands of doctors would need to lie on death certificates without any financial benefit.", "We recently rated False a similar claim from Trump that focused on hospitals.", "Trump\u2019s words imply that death certificates are subject to the whim of physicians.

The data snapshot was based on Oct. 3 figures.", "That would put the death toll at 200,000, which was very close to the number reported by another regular source, the COVID Tracking Project.", "But the CDC went further.", "\"As of Oct. 15, 216,025 deaths from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been reported in the United States,\" the report said. \"However, this number might underestimate the total impact of the pandemic on mortality.\"", "This is consistent with other studies that show no overcount of deaths from the virus.", "Individually and collectively, doctors have rejected Trump\u2019s claim.", "Philadelphia physician Dr. Priya Mammen tweeted that many frontline workers are buying their own personal protective equipment because hospitals don\u2019t have enough.
