["\u201cDoctor uses Vape Aerosols to show just how much masks don\u2019t work,\u201d the title of the September 6, 2020 video reads.", "The man in the video inhales and exhales through two different surgical masks, a cupped mask, a cloth mask, a mask with filter material and a respirator with a valve.", "\u201cThere is absolutely nothing that any of these masks do to protect you from me,\u201d he says. The nearly three-minute clip has more than 89,000 views.", "Videos of the demonstration were posted on Facebook here, and as recently as February 1, 2021 here. They identify the speaker as Ted Noel, a doctor, and this tweet further labels him as \u201can anesthesiologist with 36 years experience.\u201d", "An online search for \u201cTed Noel anesthesiologist\u201d yields entries for Dr Theodore Noel, an anesthesiology specialist in Florida\u2019s Orlando area, aged 68 -- which appears consistent with the approximate age of the man in the video. Noel\u2019s Facebook profile image and education details confirm the video shows the same man.", "A search using the Florida Department of Health\u2019s medical license verification tool shows that Noel\u2019s license expired in 2014.", "AFP spoke with several experts to address the claim in the video.", "Dr John O\u2019Horo, associate professor of medicine and an infectious disease specialist at Mayo Clinic, said the conclusions the man in the video draws are \u201cvery, very questionable,\u201d and \u201cwhat\u2019s being shown there isn\u2019t really representative of the way that masks offer protection for the wearer or for those around the wearer.\u201d", "In a phone interview, O\u2019Horo explained: \u201cThe idea that just seeing some particulates going through a mask negates their effectiveness is just a misunderstanding of how masks work. The masks do allow air and small particles to pass through. That\u2019s how we can still breathe with them on, but what they do is they take a lot of the energy out so it doesn\u2019t travel as far.\u201d", "The upshot is that masks are effective but they are only one part of a layered protection approach and should be combined with social distancing, he said.", "Christopher Sulmonte, project administrator at the Johns Hopkins Biocontainment Unit, made a similar point.", "\u201cYou\u2019ll notice that those vapors\u2026 are being hindered -- when he breathes out, they\u2019re not going out as far, but also they\u2019re going backwards, which is exactly conceptually what we\u2019re trying to do with the masks,\u201d he said by telephone.", "Sulmonte criticized the video for its attempt \u201cto create an equivalency between how SARS-CoV-2 is spread through respiratory droplets to the movement of gaseous particles.\u201d", "Respiratory droplets are much larger, and that is the main way Covid-19 is spread, he said, adding that while \u201cthere is still some concern with aerosol spread of the virus,\u201d masks still help, as demonstrated by the smoke moving sideways and backwards in the video, rather than forward.", "Aerosols are microscopic droplets released by breathing, singing and talking.", "Dr Shelley Payne, a molecular biosciences professor and head of the University of Texas at Austin\u2019s center for infectious disease, agreed via email that masks also help prevent aerosol transmission. \u201cMuch of the leakage of aerosols shown in the video is at the edges of the mask. There is less from the front of the mask, reducing exposure to a person you are facing and talking to.\u201d", "The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website clarifies that \u201cthe epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 indicates that most infections are spread through close contact, not airborne transmission.\u201d", "Dr Sam Hogue, the interim head of the Texas A&M University Department of Primary Care and Population Health, said in an email: \u201cViruses are tiny and could easily pass through masks. However, the mucous environment in which they are embedded, not so much.", "\u201cI am disappointed that a licensed physician would use smoke as an equivalent comparison,\u201d said Hogue, although as noted above, Noel\u2019s license has expired.", "Dr Jose-Luis Jimenez, a chemist and professor at the University of Colorado Boulder who specializes in aerosols, said in an email: \u201cI consider that video disinformation because they clearly don\u2019t know what they are doing with that test.\u201d", "The effectiveness of masks in limiting the potential spread of coronavirus has been extensively documented.", "A study published in January 2021 found that \u201cplaces and time periods where mask usage is required or widespread have shown substantially lower community transmission.\u201d", "Another, updated in August 2020, concluded: \u201cSocietal norms and government policies supporting the wearing of masks by the public, as well as international travel controls, are independently associated with lower per-capita mortality from Covid-19.\u201d", "As of this article\u2019s publication date, the CDC recommends people wear masks in any public setting where they will be around others. Masks are now required for public transportation within, into, or out of the US.", "Both Sulmonte and O\u2019Horo noted that masks with valves like one of those shown in the video are not recommended for use in health care settings, because they do not protect those around the wearer.", "AFP Fact Check has debunked numerous false and misleading claims about face masks and Covid-19.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
