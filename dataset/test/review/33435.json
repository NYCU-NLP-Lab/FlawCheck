["NC Rep. Chuck McGrady advocates for his nonpartisan redistricting bill during a press conference on Feb. 13, 2019 (Will Doran/News & Observer)", "There\u2019s more support for redistricting reform than meets the eye, according to one North Carolina legislator.", "For decades, North Carolina\u2019s election maps have been criticized as biased toward whichever party controlled the legislature when the maps were drawn. And currently, the state faces\u00a0four different legal challenges\u00a0to its maps.", "So Rep.\u00a0Chuck McGrady, a Republican from Henderson County, hopes the legislature will change its ways before the maps need to be redrawn in 2021. On Feb. 13,\u00a0McGrady introduced a bill\u00a0that would shift redistricting responsibilities from the legislature to a committee of non-politicians.", "Given GOP legislators have controlled the state House and state Senate since 2011, it may seem like Republicans aren\u2019t interested in redistricting reform. But that\u2019s not so, McGrady claims.", "\"In my caucus, nearly half of the Republicans now serving have voted for this type of bill \u2026 or have cosponsored one or more of the nonpartisan redistricting bills,\" McGrady said Wednesday during a\u00a0press conference.", "There are currently 65 Republicans in the House. For McGrady\u2019s claim to be correct, about 33 of them need to have previously supported a redistricting bill.", "How close does McGrady come? If we\u2019re talking about House Republicans who supported bills before 2019, McGrady comes up a little short \u2013 something he realized when contacted by PolitiFact.", "McGrady said he got his information from Bob Phillips, executive director of Common Cause NC, a left-leaning voting rights advocacy group. McGrady miscounted the number of legislators who previously supported nonpartisan redistricting, he said in an email.", "\"I didn\u2019t realize I was double counting some members since they were included both as voting for a bill and cosponsoring one or more bills,\" McGrady said, referring to a list he was given.", "It\u2019s also important to note that Republicans who previously supported a nonpartisan redistricting bill aren\u2019t necessarily going to support it this year.", "Still, McGrady\u2019s not that far off. His prediction comes close, but only because of Republicans who support his bill this year.", "Let\u2019s walk down memory lane.", "A 2011 BILL", "Among the bills McGrady mentioned in his press conference was\u00a0House Bill 824, a bill introduced in 2011 that would\u2019ve created a nonpartisan redistricting process.", "Five current House members were among the bill sponsors:", "Ten more voted for the bill at least once:", "That makes 15 Republican legislators who voted on HB 824.", "A 2013 BILL", "In 2013, a bipartisan group of legislators filed another nonpartisan redistricting bill.", "The bill,\u00a0HB 606, was never put up for a vote. But several Republican supporters of the 2011 bill sponsored HB 606, as well as these six other Republicans:", "So far, that puts our count of nonpartisan redistricting supporters at 21 Republicans.", "BILLS IN 2015, 2017", "In 2015,\u00a0HB 92\u00a0sought to form a nonpartisan redistricting commission. It was never voted on, but several current Republicans supported it, including John Fraley of Iredell County and Lee Zachary of Yadkin.", "A similar bill,\u00a0HB 200, was introduced in 2017 and never voted on. Cody Henson of Transylvania County was among a handful of Republican sponsors.", "By our count, 24 Republican House members supported nonpartisan redistricting bills before this year.", "That brings us to 2019 and the bill McGrady just introduced,\u00a0HB 69. It\u2019s sponsored by eight Republicans who weren\u2019t already on our list:", "(Goodwin, Hanig, Ross and Sasser added their names to the bill after McGrady\u2019s press conference.)", "That means, as of 3 p.m. Friday afternoon, 32 House Republicans have cosponsored or voted for a nonpartisan redistricting bill at some point. Additionally, Republican Reps. Greg Murphy of Pitt County and Keith Kidwell of Beaufort signed a\u00a0pledge with Common Cause NC, to support an independent, nonpartisan redistricting commission.", "OUR RULING", "McGrady said \"nearly half\" of House Republicans have supported a nonpartisan redistricting bill. Only 24 House Republicans (about 37 percent) supported a nonpartisan redistricting bill before 2019, which isn\u2019t close to half of the 65 GOP House members.", "But, when you consider Republican support for his new bill, he\u2019s pretty much right that nearly half of House Republicans have supported the idea of nonpartisan redistricting at some point. We rate this claim Half True.", "This story was produced by the North Carolina Fact-Checking Project, a partnership of McClatchy Carolinas, the Duke University Reporters\u2019 Lab and PolitiFact.
