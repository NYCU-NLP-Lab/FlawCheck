The map, which appears on BuzzFeed News, is powered by the election data-gathering firm Decision Desk HQ.", "Mackowiack later corrected the record and tweeted: \u201cThis tweet was taken and share honestly.

It was literally just a typo.\u201d", "J. Alex Halderman, a University of Michigan professor of computer science and engineering who is co-chair of the Michigan Election Security Advisory Commission, said \u201cthis kind of error is fairly common. Preliminary results are sometimes updated manually, for instance by copying and pasting from a spreadsheet.\u201d", "Also, Halderman said in an email to FactCheck.org, the advisory commission has recommended that Michigan conduct a risk-limiting audit following the election, as it did following the primary election; the state began piloting the audits in 2018.", "\u201c[A]ssuming that Michigan performs a risk-limiting audit, as it did in the primary, voters won\u2019t have to simply take on faith that these results are accurate,\u201d he said. \u201cThe RLA will publicly demonstrate whether the outcome reflects what\u2019s on the paper ballots.\u201d", "Later in the day, the Trump campaign alleged that it did not have \u201cmeaningful access\u201d to some areas where ballots were being counted in Michigan and said it was filing a lawsuit in an attempt to halt the counting of ballots.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
