["In a live broadcast, Tanzanian president John Magufuli, zeroed in on steam inhalation, claiming that inhaling steam treats Covid-19.", "The Tanzanian president urged his health ministry to \u201cemphasize\u201d steam inhalation as a way of treating Covid-19.", "There is no evidence that inhaling steam can treat the virus, which replicates in cells, and experts warned the practice is dangerous.", "While there are fats in the viral membrane of the virus, it is also misleading to call it \u201ca fat\u201d and that heat will \u201cdissolve\u201d it. Soap and water however will.", "As the world battles to prise itself out of the grip of the Covid-19 pandemic, president John Pombe Magufuli asked Tanzanians to look to traditional remedies.", "In a live broadcast on 22 April 2020, Magufuli, speaking in Kiswahili, zeroed in on steam inhalation, which he asked the country\u2019s health ministry to publicise as the science in favour of it was clear cut.", "\u201cNa hili ningeomba Wizara ya Afya mlisisitize zaidi, kama swala la kujifukizia.\u00a0 Na hilo scientifically ni very clear. Kwa sababu inatoka vapour ya maji katika temperature ambayo ni above 100\u00b0C. Na huyo corona kwa sababu ni futa, atapasukapasuka kwenye vapour ambayo iko above above 100\u00b0C. Kwa hiyo it is a scientific treatment. Wizara ya Afya waendelee kufafanua ni namna gani swala la kujifutizia linasaidia kupunguza corona,\u201d Magufuli said.", "[Translation: \u201cTherefore, I ask the health ministry, to emphasize this, for example the issue of steam inhalation. Scientifically, that is very clear. That\u2019s because steam comes from boiling water at temperatures above 100\u00b0C. And because the coronavirus is made up of fats, when exposed to such high temperatures above 100\u00b0C, it will just disintegrate. It is a scientific treatment.\u201d] (Note: Read a longer transcript here).", "Magufuli said that if the virus were in the nose or mouth, it would \u201cmelt\u201d at such temperatures. He also suggested adding herbs, neem or Indian lilac, and onions to the boiling water. These approaches would be important for many Tanzanians to know in the fight against the virus, he said.", "The president has been in the headlines for his views on the Covid-19 pandemic. But is steam inhalation, an approach that has a lot of traction in East Africa, worth trying as a treatment for the disease?", "To make sure nothing was lost in translation, Africa Check asked language scholars what exactly the president recommended in his speech.", "Prof Kimani Njogu, a Kiswahili linguist, said that \u201ckufukizia\u201d translated to \u201csteam inhalation\u201d.", "Dr Leonard Muaka, the president of Chaukidu, the global association for the promotion of Kiswahili, said that \u201ckufukizia\u201d is when you cover the head, usually with a blanket, over a pan of boiled or boiling water in order to inhale the steam.", "\u201cIn this context we can say he was talking about \u2018herbal steaming\u2019,\u201d said Muaka, who is also an associate professor in the department of world languages and culture at Howard University in the US.", "It is \u201cvery unlikely\u201d that steam inhalation would treat the coronavirus, Alberto Escherio, professor of epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health in the US, told Africa Check.", "\u201cThe virus in infected individuals is within cells and will not be reached by steam,\u201d he said.", "Tsumoru Shintake, a professor at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology in Japan, has studied the possibility of using \u201ccontrolled ethanol vapour inhalation\u201d to disinfect the human respiratory tract of the new coronavirus. The study said this could be useful for clinical workers, as they may \u201cneed to use prompt preventative measures at any time\u201d.", "Shintake, who said his background was in physics, directed us to a study that showed that when the virus was exposed to temperatures as high as 70\u00b0C, the time for its inactivation was \u201creduced to five minutes\u201d.", "But physically attempting this, whether at 70\u00b0C or 100\u00b0C, is dangerous, Shintake said, and would lead to serious burns. Temperatures in the nasal cavity range between 32 and 34\u00b0C, he said.", "\u201cDo do not try [to inhale steam]. You will damage the epithelium cells in your nose.\u201d", "Harvard\u2019s Escherio agreed. \u201cIt is not safe and is likely to cause serious burns. And no matter how hot the steam is, it will not reach active viral particles that are replicating within cells,\u201d he said.", "Is the coronavirus a fat?", "SARS-CoV-2, or \u201csevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2\u201d, is the technical name of the virus that causes Covid-19.But is it made up of fat? This is \u201cpartly\u201d accurate as \u201cthere are fats in the viral membrane\u201d of the coronavirus, Alberto Escherio, an epidemiology and nutrition professor at the US Harvard School of Public Health told Africa Check.", "But to describe the virus wholly as \u201ca fat\u201d is misleading, Tsumoru Shintake, a professor at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology in Japan, said. This is because its structure is more complicated.\u201c[The] weak-point of SARS-CoV-2 is its envelope, made up of a lipid bilayer. Some constituents in the lipid bilayer are actually sort of fats, but not just fats,\u201d Shintake said. (Note: Read more about this structure. UNESCO, the UN\u2019s science agency, also explains here why water is not enough to dissolve the coronavirus and why soap is so essential .)", "We have previously fact-checked similar inhalation claims and not found any evidence that it is a viable treatment for Covid-19. Other fact-checkers including Reuters, France24 and the BBC have also found no evidence to back up this resilient claim.", "\u201cExposing yourself to the sun or to temperatures higher than 25\u00b0C DOES NOT prevent coronavirus disease,\u201d the World Health Organization said in a coronavirus \u201cmyth-buster\u201d article.", "The WHO added that your normal body temperature remained around 36.5 to 37\u00b0C, regardless of the temperature of the steam you breathe, or the hot bath or shower you take.", "The health agency is clear\u00a0 there is no cure for Covid-19 yet and has campaigned for handwashing with soap and cold or warm water due to how these interact with the coronavirus.", "In a national address, Tanzanian president John Magufuli advised citizens to inhale steam to beat the new coronavirus.", "Experts told Africa Check that it is very unlikely this would work, and is dangerous.", "There is no effective treatment for Covid-19 yet.", "Please complete this form to receive the HTML sharing code.", "Africa Check values your trust and is committed to the responsible management, use and protection of personal information.
