This year the hawks seem out in force,\" reads a now deleted\u00a0post\u00a0 by the page Mentone News & Information.\u00a0\"The pets that are in real danger are ones who are 12 pounds and under. These are the pets that hawks can swoop down and grab.\"", "The top of the image reads, \"HAWK WARNING\" in large red bold letters and the page captioned the image, \"Keep a(n) eye on your small pet's!\"", "Upon being contacted by USA TODAY,\u00a0Mentone News & Information deleted the warning and said that a source should have been included in the post.", "However, the same post has already been reshared\u00a0by Facebook pages Jamie's Animal Rescue on\u00a0March 16 and Hardin County Humane Society in a March 14 post with over 12,000 shares.", "\"This is no joke! Predator birds such as Hawks and owls are in full force right now. Most of their 'diet'\u00a0did not survive the freeze , so they are out hunting more than usual and desperate for food,\" Jamie's Animal Rescue wrote. \"They don\u2019t care if it\u2019s domesticated or wild. It all tastes the same to them\"", "The posts do not specify a location or veterinarian office that sent out the alleged warning.\u00a0Hardin County Humane Society said they\u00a0had no comment. USA TODAY reached out to Jamie's Animal Rescue\u00a0for comment.", "Fact check: Yes, people experiencing homelessness are eligible for the stimulus", "It is unclear where the post originated, however,\u00a0the earliest version of the post dates back to\u00a0the Humane Society of the Tennessee Valley in\u00a0November 2015.", "The image was shared to Animals Matter's Hamlethub, and the warning reads that hawks are out in force \"off the east coast,\" which has been colored out in the social media versions of the post.", "When the warning first went viral in 2016, CBS Philadelphia reported that KYW Newsradio checked with different park rangers, vet offices, animal control departments, and Pennsylvania and New Jersey divisions of fish and wildlife. None was aware of any sort of hawk warning.", "Later in 2018, the image went viral on social media once again, when Christine Newman,\u00a0operations officer for the Toms River Office of Emergency Management, shared it on social media after her 7-pound dog had a close encounter with two hawks circling overhead, according to\u00a0Philly Voice.", "Newman's post got shares from users in Florida, Georgia, Connecticut, Arizona and other states.
