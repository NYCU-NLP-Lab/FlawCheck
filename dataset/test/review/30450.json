Gwen Moore argued that despite pushback from Republicans, there is precedent for a Supreme Court nomination to be approved during a presidential election year.", "The Milwaukee Democrat urged in a tweet on March 16, 2016 that the U.S. Senate give Garland a 'fair hearing'\u00a0and a timely vote on his nomination. Her claim was made in an image she attached, which said:", "'6 justices confirmed in presidential election years since 1912.'", "Virtually since the moment it was announced that Justice Antonin Scalia had died, Democrats and Republicans have clashed over when he should be replaced.", "Democrats\u00a0such as Moore and Wisconsin U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin\u00a0contend that Obama should make an appointment, regardless of the fact the presidential election will be held in November 2016.", "Republicans\u00a0such as House Speaker Paul Ryan and U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, both of Wisconsin, argue the Senate should not confirm any nominee until after Obama is replaced in January 2017.", "So let\u2019s see if Moore is right -- that six times since 1912, a justice nominated to the high court during a presidential election year has been confirmed by the Senate.", "The nominee", "According to The HIll: Garland, 63, is a 19-year veteran of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit; he currently serves as chief judge, a position he\u2019s held since February 2013. He was nominated to that court by Democratic President Bill Clinton. He is sometimes described as a moderate, though some conservatives label him anti-gun.", "In nominating Garland, Obama highlighted his work as a top Justice Department official in directing the prosecution of Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols for the 1994 Oklahoma City bombings. The president noted that Garland received past praise from John Roberts, the current chief justice, and GOP Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah.", "A partisan battle over the nomination is expected.
