Galloway was talking about the states individually and not combined.", "We found that it was difficult to pinpoint the number of felons who are now eligible to vote but estimates put it above the residential population of many smaller states.", "Amendment 4, approved by about 64 percent of voters, amends the state Constitution to restore voting rights of Floridians with felony convictions after they complete the terms of their sentence including parole or probation.
