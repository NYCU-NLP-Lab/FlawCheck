The title states:\u00a0\u201cExtreme Crash PIA ATR 42 Flight 661 Islamabad\u201d.", "In the video description, the YouTube channel states\u00a0the footage is a simulation created using Flight Simulator X, a flight simulation programme published by Microsoft, and not a real life incident.", "It states: \u201cAll crashes are no real plane crashes, real one are terrible.
