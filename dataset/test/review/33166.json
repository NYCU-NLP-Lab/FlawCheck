(AP Photo)", "Joe Biden is pushing back against the perception that he\u2019s not progressive enough for today\u2019s Democratic Party.", "Long seen as his Achilles\u2019 heel in this Democratic primary, Biden\u2019s 35-year Senate voting record reveals a history of breaking with liberal orthodoxy on a variety of issues, from his vote to authorize the Iraq War to his backing of measures that led to mass incarceration.", "Biden, in a recent interview, sought to turn the narrative on its head by claiming progressive credentials.", "\"I was always labeled as one of the most liberal members of the United States Congress,\" the former Delaware senator told ABC News in an interview that aired May 1.", "After a review of sources that grade lawmakers based on ideology, we found Biden\u2019s claim to be inaccurate. By a variety of measures, Biden\u2019s record has been that of a moderate Democrat.", "We examined several different ideology ratings to assess Biden\u2019s claim.", "One of the most widely cited among academics is the Voteview database, which is maintained by UCLA. Voteview derives lawmakers\u2019 ideological grades from roll call votes. (Read their full methodology here.)", "Below is how Voteview ranks Biden\u00a0from 1973 through\u00a02008: The purple line shows how liberal Biden was compared to the full Senate, while the blue line shows how he measured up among Senate Democrats. (In the chart below, the most liberal senator would be rated 100 percent and the least liberal senator would be rated zero.)", "Biden was on average more liberal than about 75% of the Senate overall. Among Democrats, he was in the middle of the pack. On average, he stood at almost exactly his party\u2019s center line.", "By either measure, it\u2019s misleading for Biden to claim he was always labeled one of the most liberal members.", "\"I think it\u2019s fair to say that Voteview does not, and has not, so labeled him,\" said Jeffrey Lewis, a political science professor at UCLA who runs the database.", "Some years saw Biden align more closely with progressive members of his party than others. His first noteworthy break came early in his Senate career, when he opposed busing as a means to racially desegregate schools.", "\"Biden, who once participated in sit-ins to desegregate restaurants along U.S. Route 40, startled his colleagues in 1975 when he broke liberal ranks to win Senate approval of an anti-busing amendment,\" reads a profile of Biden from Congressional Quarterly. \"Suddenly, he was allied with Southern conservatives on an emotional national issue.\"", "Biden\u2019s position may have helped him get re-elected in 1978. As his campaign was underway, a controversial busing plan was taking effect in New Castle County, Del., \"outraging voters in the white suburbs,\" according to CQ.", "\"With this anti-busing position offsetting his liberalism on some other social issues, Biden seemed unbeatable in 1978,\" his CQ profile states. It notes that his opponent was unsuccessful in painting Biden as \"too far left for the state.\"", "Nevertheless, Biden\u2019s first taste of disunity with liberal Democrats seemed hard for the young senator to swallow.", "\"It is not a comfortable feeling for me,\" Biden said at the time, according to CQ. \"I mean, I\u2019ve never been there before.\"", "But it would not the last time he broke with Democratic ranks. As we\u2019ve noted, recent progressive attacks on Biden\u2019s record have some merit.", "Biden\u2019s image as someone willing to buck his party\u2019s liberal wing on social issues was cemented by the early 1980s.", "\"On cultural issues, he often does not support positions associated with liberal Democrats,\" read a profile of Biden in the 1984 issue of the National Journal\u2019s Almanac of American Politics, considered by some to the the Bible of U.S. politics.", "A spokesman for the Biden campaign defended the former senator and vice president\u2019s progressive record.", "\"Vice President Biden has been a force for progressive action throughout his career \u2014 from campaign finance reform to climate change to systemic racism to organized labor to marriage equality,\" said Biden aide TJ Ducklo. \"He's never been afraid to be the first to speak out, and has worked tirelessly in Congress and as vice president to write, pass and implement progressive policies into law.\"", "The campaign noted that shortly before leaving the Senate to become Barack Obama\u2019s vice president, Biden notched some high marks for liberalism. He received a 94% overall liberal score in 2007 from the National Journal, and Voteview found he was more liberal than 75% of the 110th Senate.", "But Biden has not always been labeled one of the most liberal members \u2014 not by the National Journal or the other rating systems we looked at \u2014 which is what he\u2019s claiming.", "PolitiFact located two decades\u2019 worth of National Journal ratings and found Biden\u2019s average liberalism score was 76%. His lowest National Journal score we found was 59% in 1997, the year Biden was one of a handful of Democrats who joined Republicans in a failed effort to amend the Constitution to require a balanced budget.", "Biden\u2019s position as the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee during this era often found him in the crosscurrents of emotional political debates.", "\"The issues that arise here \u2014 abortion, flag-burning, capital punishment, crime control \u2014 cut deeply,\" reads his profile in the Almanac. \"And for years the cultural liberals in the Democratic Party differed sharply on most of them from the constituents Biden saw in Delaware every day.\"", "The Biden campaign\u2019s reference to his Voteview score cited only his ranking among senators of both parties. Among Democrats in the 110th Senate, Biden was in the 51st percentile for liberalism.", "Another group that ranks legislators by ideology, GovTrack.us, failed to support\u00a0Biden\u2019s claim. A GovTrack.us analysis of bills that Biden sponsored and cosponsored from 2003 through 2008 shows Biden\u2019s liberal record in Congress was not superlative.", "Like Voteview, GovTrack places Biden in the middle of his Senate Democratic cohort too.", "Source: GovTrack.us", "One reason for Biden\u2019s middling score on the ideological scale is his track record of bipartisanship.", "\"He seems drawn again and again to try to reconcile the economic and cultural liberalism of the national Democratic Party, of which he is one of the leaders, with the economic and cultural conservatism of so many of those he grew up with: to explain one to the other, to reconcile them, to enable them to live happily together,\" reads a 1996 profile of Biden in the Almanac of American Politics.", "During Biden\u2019s time in the Senate, just over 40% of the bills he co-sponsored were introduced by Republicans, according to an analysis by Benjamin Hammer of GovTrack.", "In his last two years as a senator, Biden crossed the aisle more than even Amy Klobuchar, who GovTrack ranks as the most moderate of the Senate Democrats running for president in 2020, Hammer said.", "Josh Tauberer, who founded GovTrack, summed up his group\u2019s findings this way: \"We rate Biden's claim as false.\"", "Biden said, \"I was always labeled as one of the most liberal members of the United States Congress.\"", "A review of several databases that grade lawmakers based on ideology shows Biden has not always earned high grades for liberalism, and occasionally earned low marks.
