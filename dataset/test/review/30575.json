["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on October 11, 2019", "A viral, made-up story sowed confusion among social media users over whether House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has diverted Social Security money to the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump. She didn\u2019t.", "House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has not taken money away from Social Security in order to fund the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump.", "That hoax is the product of America\u2019s Last Line of Defense, a self-described \u201csatirical\u201d publication whose viral headlines across a network of websites often deceive social media users. Its story was published Oct. 4 on one its websites, potatriotsunite.com, with the headline, \u201cPelosi Diverts $2.4 Billion From Social Security To Cover Impeachment Costs.\u201d", "Observant users who clicked through to the full story might have noticed the many tags littered throughout the page indicating its fictitious nature: A banner at the top of the website, for example, reads, \u201cPotatriots unite for satire, ridicule and mockery.\u201d", "But it appears many did not. More than two dozen people emailed FactCheck.org inquiring about whether the claim was true, and the story has been shared more than 100,000 times on Facebook, according to CrowdTangle data.", "The bogus story appeared in political Facebook groups supportive of Trump \u2014 such as \u201cThe Common Thread (C) \u2013 Trump \u2013 Pence 2020,\u201d \u201cPeople who support President Trump,\u201d and \u201cDeplorables for Trump\u201d \u2014 where it was often met by outrage.", "One user opined: \u201cThis is nothing new..Pelosi and the Democrats think all the US money is theirs..to do whatever they want to at any whim. Only a Revolution..as distasteful as it sounds, on it\u2019s face, maybe the only way to save our Country\u2026The Politicians can\u2019t or won\u2019t do it\u2026.It\u2019s coming\u2026fasten your seatbelt.\u201d", "Another wrote: \u201cENOUGH!!!!!!! NO ONE IS SUPPOSED TO TOUCH THAT MONEY!!!! THAT\u2019S ALL AMERICAN CITIZENS WHO PAID INTO IT EVERY PAYCHECK SINCE DAY ONE! AND THEIR EMPLOYERS MATCHED THE AMOUNT WE PAID INTO IT! IT\u2019S OUR SAVINGS ACCOUNT FOR RETIREMENT!!! WHO Authorized that!!!!!???????\u201d", "It\u2019s worth noting that Social Security is a pay-as-you-go system, meaning that current Social Security tax revenues are used to pay the cost of current benefits, as explained in a 2019 report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. Surplus revenues can be used for other government expenses, but Social Security has run cash-flow deficits every year since 2010, CRS says, so there isn\u2019t any surplus revenues that can be used for other government expenses. That rules out the possibility that Social Security funds can be used to cover the cost of an impeachment inquiry.", "And Social Security benefit payments are considered \u201cmandatory spending\u201d and are not subject to the annual appropriations process.", "We do not know how much the impeachment inquiry proceedings against Trump will ultimately cost.", "The Associated Press, citing records at the time, reported in 1999 that the five-month impeachment proceedings against former President Bill Clinton cost about $1.2 million \u2014 or nearly $1.9 million in today\u2019s dollars, when adjusted for inflation.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
