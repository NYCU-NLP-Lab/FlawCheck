The spokesperson also said that all of Southwest\u2019s flights are equipped with HEPA (High-Efficiency Particulate Air) filters, which also are used in hospitals to provide patients with clean air.", "All in all, it seems Kelly has some valid points about the safety of airplanes right now. But he also overplayed his hand.", "So, how might someone contract COVID-19 on a plane?", "As with any setting that holds many people at the same time, there is a risk of virus transmission through the air as well as from high-touch surfaces. On an airplane, that could be a bathroom door handle. And it is easy to picture how this risk can be amplified on a long flight with other travelers.", "Case studies have shown that disease transmission occurs on flights. In 2003, for instance,\u00a016 people\u00a0tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS \u2013 a coronavirus closely related to COVID, after flying on a plane with a symptomatic passenger.

A lot of the droplets are too large to stay airborne long, while others are very small and can stay airborne for hours. The small droplets are called aerosols.", "Though the air in an airplane is highly circulated, Chen said aerosols can still hang in the air for about three to four minutes before being sucked up by the ventilation system.", "Aerosols \"can be really dangerous. They have the highest risk,\" said Chen. \"The small droplets can get to the seven rows around a sick passenger within four minutes.\" However, Chen was quick to point out that his studies were focused on other airborne diseases, like flu, tuberculosis and SARS.", "Airlines maintain that there is\u00a0little evidence\u00a0that COVID-19 transmission has occurred on planes and that their\u00a0ventilation systems\u00a0are\u00a099.9% effective\u00a0at filtering out microscopic particles.

Clearly not.", "It\u2019s clear that airlines do carry a transmission risk for illnesses like COVID-19, especially if you end up seated close to an infectious person. And people have less control over social distancing on airplanes than in other spaces.", "Overall, Chen said he thought it could be reasonably safe as long as every passenger and crew member wore a mask.
