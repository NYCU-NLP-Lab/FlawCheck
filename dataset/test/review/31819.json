["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "Republican U.S. Senate candidate George Allen has been a relentless critic of President Barack Obama\u2019s health care reform law, calling it \"a government takeover of health care.\"\n\nHe used that phrase in a radio commercial that ran just before his victory in the June 12 Republican Primary, during a June 15 speech in Washington to the Faith and Freedom Coalition and in a June 16 speech at the GOP state convention in Richmond. In each instance, he criticized his Democratic opponent, Tim Kaine, for supporting the health care law and being an ally of the president.\n\nThe Weekly Standard, in a June 25 article, wrote that Allen\u2019s stump speech \"always includes a dig at Obamacare -- which Allen describes as a \u2019government takeover of health care.\u2019\" \u00a0\u00a0\n\nWe asked Allen\u2019s campaign for the rationale behind the candidate\u2019s \"takeover\" claim but did not receive an explanation.\n\nBut the refrain has been used by Republicans and debunked by fact-checkers. Since Allen is using the claim regularly, we decided to review it again.\n\nThere\u2019s no question the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act expands government regulation of health care. The law mandates that most Americans have health care insurance or pay a tax penalty. The U.S. Supreme Court narrowly upheld that provision on June 28 in a 5-4 opinion.", "The law prohibits insurance companies from denying coverage based on a person\u2019s pre-existing health conditions and from imposing lifetime caps on an individual\u2019s benefits. It increases eligibility for Medicaid, although the high court struck down the federal government\u2019s ability to withhold funds from states that refuse to take part in the expansion. The act provides credits for people who can\u2019t afford to purchase insurance.\n\nBut the law does not create a \"government takeover\" of health care. Here\u2019s why:\n\n*The government will not seize control of hospitals and other privately-run health care businesses. Doctors will not become government employees, as they are in Britain.\n\n*The law continues to rely on the private sector to provide health insurance for consumers. In fact, its coverage mandate will expand the number of people who buy private insurance policies. The act sets up exchanges where private companies will compete to insure people who don\u2019t have policies. \u00a0\n\n*Employer-based coverage through private insurance companies will continue.\n\n*The law does not contain a \"public option\" allowing the government to compete for business with private insurers.\n\n*It does not create a single-payer system, like in Canada, where medical payments are funded by a single insurance pool controlled by the government.\n\nPolitiFact has ruled past claims that the law is a government takeover as either False or Pants on Fire. In 2010, PolitiFact\u2019s national team named the takeover claim the \"Lie of the Year,\" saying it conjured images of socialized medical care.\n\nThe Associated Press has also said the law \"does not add up to a government takeover.\" The Washington Post Fact Checker column said the \"government takeover\" label is \"simply not true.\" And FactCheck.org has said that the law will not lead to \"government-run\" health care.\n\nDrew Altman, president and chief executive officer of the Kaiser Family Foundation, came to the same conclusion in an August 2011 column entitled \"Are we headed for a government takeover of Health Care?\"\n\nAltman wrote that actuarial figures released that month from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services show that the state and federal government share of health care spending was 45 percent in 2010 -- the year the law was signed. By 2020, that is expected to rise to 49 percent.\n\n\"In other words, government\u2019s share of national health spending, while unquestionably large, is not growing much at all, and even in 10 years it will be less than half of our country\u2019s total health spending,\" Altman wrote. \"Measured by the government\u2019s share of health care spending, there is no sign of a government takeover of the health care system.\"\n\nThe report, Altman said, demonstrated the nation\u2019s health care system has been and will remain \"a mixed public-private one.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nAllen says that the health care reform law is a \"government takeover of health care.\"\n\nYes, the law increases regulation. But it greatly relies on the private sector to provide health care. Hospitals will not be taken over by the government, doctors will not become federal employees. The act relies on private insurers to compete and provide health care coverage to an expanded customer base. Employer-based coverage through private companies continues.\n\nThe \"government takeover of health care\" is a potent political charge that does not hold up under examination.
