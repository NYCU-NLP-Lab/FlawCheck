["Charlie Crist has gone on the offensive against Gov. Rick Scott, launching a TV ad campaign and pulling no punches in interviews.", "In one freewheeling discussion with the Tampa Bay Times editorial board July 16, 2014, former Gov. Crist attacked Scott\u2019s education spending.", "\"I can only imagine how nice it would be to serve as governor when you have a surplus of almost $3 billion. That\u2019s what this guy has right now,\" Crist said. \"And in spite of it, he still hasn\u2019t matched what I did during the recession for per-pupil funding for kids. In fact, he\u2019s about $200 less.\"", "PolitiFact Florida has done many checks on claims about school spending by these two candidates, but we wanted to know if Scott really budgeted $200 less per student than Crist. Good thing both governors have permanent records for us to check.", "Budget crunch", "As a quick overview, the Florida Education Finance Program is the main source of dollars for K-12 education. By law, it\u2019s a combination of state and local funding. Each school district must contribute property tax dollars, called the \"required local effort,\" in an amount dictated by the state. In recent years, the state has also received federal stimulus dollars.", "Scott has been touting the $18.9 billion K-12 education spending budget he signed this year as the largest in state history. We rated that Half True, because it was the largest in terms of dollars spent, but not after inflation and not per pupil.", "When we break down the most recent budget, it works out to $6,937 in spending per pupil. Even though the budget is higher, Florida schools now have a higher enrollment, roughly 90,000 more than in 2007, according to state projections at the start of the 2014-15 school year.", "Crist has been contending that his per-pupil spending has been higher, referring to the $7,126 per student allocated in his\u00a0$18.7 billion education budget for 2007-08. That works out to an $189 difference.", "But considering both governors\u2019 terms as a whole, there\u2019s more to the story. Education budgets declined during Crist\u2019s administration, with a corresponding drop in per-pupil spending, save for a slight bounce his last year in office.", "Scott, meanwhile, came into office looking to slash $3.3 billion out of the education budget, resulting in a $700 per pupil cut. But lawmakers balked. He settled for knocking $1.3 billion out of the budget, dropping per-student dollars by $540, due in part to a loss in federal stimulus money that had been shoring up spending for Crist\u2019s last two budgets. Then Scott\u2019s numbers started to steadily rise.", "Fiscal year", "K-12 budget (total)", "Per pupil spending", "2007-08 (Crist)", "$18.7 billion", "$7,126", "2008-09 (Crist)", "$17.9 billion", "$6,846", "2009-10 (Crist)*", "$18 billion", "$6,846", "2010-11 (Crist)*", "$18.2 billion", "$6,897", "2011-12 (Scott)", "$16.6 billion", "$6,217", "2012-13 (Scott)", "$17.2 billion", "$6,376", "2013-14 (Scott)", "$18.3 billion", "$6,761", "2014-15 (Scott)", "$18.9 billion", "$6,937", "The two years with an asterisk were years when the state received about $900 million each in federal stimulus money.", "In context, Crist said Scott \"still hasn\u2019t matched what I did during the recession for per-pupil funding for kids.\" Crist signed his first budget in 2007, a year before the Great Recession began. In 2008, education funding dropped to less than what the 2014 budget now offers. If you compared the 2008-09 budget to Scott\u2019s current budget, Crist is actually behind.", "However, these numbers don\u2019t account for inflation. If they did, that 2007-08 number would equal $8,176 in 2014 dollars, $1,200 more than what is currently budgeted per student.", "Even at the lowest spending during Crist\u2019s tenure in 2009-10, the inflation-adjusted total in state and local funding would be around $7,209, still a higher value than Scott\u2019s last budget.", "Our ruling", "Crist said Scott\u2019s per-pupil education spending is \"about $200 less\" than the Crist administration did during the recession.", "Scott\u2019s current budget does spend almost $200 less per student than Crist did in 2007, but that was before the recession really hit. Spending was less during the other three years of Crist\u2019s term -- although still higher than some of Scott\u2019s years.", "It\u2019s worth noting that Scott cut school funding when he came into office, but has gradually increased it to a level that\u2019s currently higher than what Crist signed off on during the Great Recession.", "When you account for inflation, though, Crist\u2019s per-pupil spending outpaces Scott\u2019s for every year.", "We rate the statement Mostly True.", "Interview with Charlie Crist, July 16, 2014", "PolitiFact Florida, \"Rick Scott says his K-12 education budget proposal is highest in Florida's history,\" Jan. 29, 2014", "PolitiFact Florida, \"Charlie Crist says 'Rick Scott tried to slash school funding by $3.3 billion',\" March 27, 2014", "Miami Herald, \"Gov.
