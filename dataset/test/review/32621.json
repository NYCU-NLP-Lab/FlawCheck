The report also notes that Gotham hired Extra Mile Casting as a subcontractor \"to provide administrative support at Trump's announcement.\"", "Both the campaign and Gotham gave vague descriptions of the services provided by Extra Mile, but the FEC report notes those services included providing \"at least some\" of the rally attendees:", "It is not uncommon for campaigns to hire companies or Casting agencies like Extra Mile to generate a crowd at an event.
