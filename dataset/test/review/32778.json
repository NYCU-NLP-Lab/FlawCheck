["In January 2011, GE Foundation, the philanthropic organization of General Electric Co., gave Milwaukee Public Schools the largest donation it ever received: $20.4 million to improve science and math education.\n\nWisconsin Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch was among officials who attended an event announcing the five-year gift. She made this comment:\n\n\"We know that right now United States students are achieving at number 25 out of 29 developing countries when it comes to science and math.\"\n\nMany leaders have long lamented the science and math performance of U.S. students compared with that of students in other countries.\n\nBut we wondered about Kleefisch\u2019s 25th out of 29 comment. It was picked up in a news report by WTMJ-TV and repeated in a blog post on Jan. 26, 2011 on Kleefisch\u2019s website, RebeccaForReal.com.\n\nKleefisch\u2019s aide, Jeanne Tarantino, said the Republican lieutenant governor based her comment on talking points provided by GE, including one that was similar to what Kleefisch said: \"U.S. students rank 25th out of the 29 developed nations for preparedness in math and science.\"\n\nWe could see how Kleefisch might have misspoken by saying \"developing\" rather than \"developed\" countries; the U.S. certainly would be in the developed category.\n\nBut even at that, does the U.S. really rank near the bottom in science and math?\n\nGE told us the source of its talking points was a U.S. Department of Education summary of the 2009 Programme for International Student Assessment. PISA, as it is known, is a ranking of 15-year-olds based on international tests. The 2009 results were released in December 2010, about a month before the grant was announced.\n\nContrary to Kleefisch\u2019s statement, PISA does not do a science-math combination ranking; they do not do a ranking of 29 countries (developed or otherwise); and they do not rank the U.S. 25th in science or math.\n\nWe confirmed those points with Holly Xie, author of the Education Department summary.\n\nPISA assesses science and math separately and it does so with two sets of rankings. One is for 34 industrialized countries and the other is for 65 entities -- 60 countries plus five other educational systems.\n\nSo how does the U.S. rank?\n\nAccording to the Education Department summary:", "So, in science, the U.S. ranked in the top half of industrialized countries and even higher in the larger group.", "In the larger group of 65, Shanghai-China ranked first and the U.S. tied for 24th.\n\nSo, in math, the U.S. ranked in the lower half of industrialized countries and much better in the larger group.\n\nLet\u2019s review.\n\nKleefisch said U.S. students \"are achieving at number 25 out of 29 developing countries when it comes to science and math.\" We assume she meant \"developed\" rather than \"developing\" countries. But her point was that U.S. students ranked near the bottom in science and math.\n\nThe test results cited, however, do not include a science-math combination ranking. What they show is the U.S. ranks in the top half of industrialized countries in science; in math, it\u2019s in the lower half, but not near the bottom.", "Indeed, after we requested additional information from GE, the company told us Feb. 4, 2011, that it erred in saying the U.S. ranks 25th of 29 countries in science and math.", "We rate Kleefisch\u2019s statement False.", "RebeccaForReal.com, GE Foundation to support MPS, Jan. 26, 2011\n\nMilwaukee Journal Sentinel, MPS awarded $20 million grant, Jan. 19, 2011\n\nWTMJ-TV, GE Foundation gives $20 million grant to MPS, Jan. 19, 2011\n\nOnMilwaukee.com, GE Foundation gives MPS $20.4 million, Jan. 19, 2011\n\nGeneral Electric Co. news release, Jan. 19, 2011\n\nJSOnline.com, International test results reignite \u2018how do we compare\u2019 game, Dec. 8, 2010\n\nU.S. Department of Education, Highlights from PISA 2009, December 2010\n\nE-mail interview, U.S. Department of Education project officer/statistician Holly Xie, Feb. 3, 2011\n\nE-mail interview, General Electric Co. spokesman Frank Mantero, Feb. 3, 2011", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
