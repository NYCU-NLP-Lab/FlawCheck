["About this rating", "A reproduced tweet by Giuliani about the U.S. giving $3.7M to a Wuhan lab in 2017 was real, and the Wuhan Institute of Virology was one of several institutions that received NIH research grants.", "The $3.7M in grant funding was an aggregate total divided among several different institutions; it was disbursed between 2014 and 2019 (under both the Obama and Trump administrations); and it was not a form of grant that had been prohibited in 2014.", "Snopes is still fighting an \u201cinfodemic\u201d of rumors and misinformation surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, and you can help.

And given that U.S. government funding is typically proposed, approved, budgeted, and appropriated long before it is actually disbursed, Giuliani's reference to the year 2017 wasn't necessarily as much of a gaffe as it might have superficially appeared. The former mayor still managed to get plenty wrong in a single tweet, however.", "As we noted in a previous article here on Snopes.com, the referenced $3.7 million comprised a series of multiple grants for coronavirus research issued by the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases over the course of several years to different entities, of which the Wuhan Institute of Virology was just one:", "Between 2014 and 2019, the EcoHealth Alliance was awarded a series of grants totaling approximately $3.7 million by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (a division of the National Institutes of Health) to study the \u201crisk of future coronavirus (CoV) emergence from wildlife using in-depth field investigations across the human-wildlife interface in China.\u201d Only a portion of this money has been used to fund research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, however, and approximately $700,000 of this grant money was awarded under the Trump administration.", "Under award number NIAID R01AI110964, NIH also funded studies produced by institutions in the United States, Australia, and Singapore, and the work involving the Wuhan Institute of Virology was an international collaboration with the New York-based EcoHealth Alliance.", "While these funds were originally appropriated by the NIH in 2014 during the Obama administration, the most recent payment, in 2019, was authorized by the Trump administration.", "Furthermore, such grants were not \"prohibited\" in 2014. As noted above, the grants questioned by Giuliani were to study the \"risk of future coronavirus (CoV) emergence from wildlife.\" Back in October 2014, the U.S. had placed a funding moratorium on one specific type of research, gain-of-function (GOF) studies that have \"the potential to enhance the pathogenicity or transmissibility of potential pandemic pathogens\" and had \"raised biosafety and biosecurity concerns, including the potential dual use risks associated with the misuse of the information or products resulting from such research\":", "Concerns over so-called \u201cgain-of-function\u201d (GOF) studies that make pathogens more potent or likely to spread in people erupted in 2011, when [virologist Yoshihiro] Kawaoka\u2019s team and Ron Fouchier\u2019s lab at Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, announced that they had modified the H5N1 bird flu virus to enable it to spread between ferrets. Such studies could help experts prepare for pandemics, but pose risks if the souped-up pathogen escapes the lab. After a long discussion, the National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity (NSABB) decided the two studies should be published and federal officials issued new oversight rules for certain H5N1 studies.", "But U.S. officials grew uneasy after the publication of new GOF papers and several accidents in U.S. biocontainment labs. In October 2014, they announced an unprecedented \u201cpause\u201d on funding for 21 GOF studies of influenza, MERS, and severe acute respiratory syndrome viruses. NIH eventually exempted some studies found to pose relatively little risk. But eight influenza studies and three MERS projects remained on hold.", "The coronavirus research funded between 2014 and 2019 via the grants referenced by Giuliani did not encompass gain-of-function studies and was therefore not \"prohibited.\" (The gain-of-function funding moratorium was finally lifted in December 2017.)", "New York's former mayor was correct in noting that the Wuhan Institute of Virology did receive some research funding via grants from the NIH, but he erred in all the other details stated or implied in his tweet.", "Evon, Dan and Alex Kasprak. \u00a0 \"Did Obama Admin Give Wuhan Laboratory a $3.7 Million Grant?\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Snopes.com. \u00a0 24 April 2020.", "National Institutes of Health. \u00a0 \"Gain of Function Research.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Accessed 20 May 2020.", "Kaiser, Jocelyn. \u00a0 \"NIH Lifts 3-Year Ban on Funding Risky Virus Studies.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Science. \u00a0 19 December 2017.", "Brewster, Jack. \u00a0 \"A Timeline of the COVID-19 Wuhan Lab Origin Theory.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Forbes. \u00a0 10 May 2020.", "David Mikkelson founded the site now known as snopes.com back in 1994.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
