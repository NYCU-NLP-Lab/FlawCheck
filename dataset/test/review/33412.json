How he proposes to pay for it -- partially by increasing taxes on the wealthy via a higher tax rate on income earned from selling assets -- \u00a0would be \"a prescription for economic slowdown,\" Kasich, a Republican, said on Fox News Sunday Jan. 25.", "To support his position, he relayed a quote that he said comes from former President Abraham Lincoln.", "\"You can\u2019t build a little guy up by tearing the big guy down,\" Kasich said. \"Abraham Lincoln said it then, and he\u2019s right.\"", "There\u2019s only one problem. Lincoln never said that.", "The true author is Rev. William J. H. Boetcker, a minister-turned-public speaker, born in 1873, eight years after Lincoln was killed. After he left the pulpit, Boetcker, a political conservative, negotiated labor relations.", "In 1916, Boetcker published the list of \"10 Cannots,\" a collection of personal truisms largely centered around the benefits of laissez-faire capitalism. The axioms have been mistakenly attributed to Lincoln for decades.", "Here are all 10 Cannots (Kasich used No. 3.):", "1. You cannot bring about prosperity by discouraging thrift.", "2.

It stems from\u00a0Boetcker himself, according to Did Lincoln Own Slaves? And Other Frequently Asked Questions about Abraham Lincoln, a book by Gerald Prokopowicz, a Lincoln expert at East Carolina University.", "In 1916, Boetcker published leaflets that had a real Lincoln quote on one side and his \"cannots\" on the other. A reader could easily assume these were also Lincoln quotes, and they did.", "Kasich\u2019s spokesman pointed us to the fact that in 1950, Rep.

You cannot help men permanently by doing for them what they could and should do for themselves.\u2019 \"", "So we\u2019ve established that Lincoln did not say that line Kasich used to support his position against raising taxes on the wealthy -- \"You cannot help little men by tearing down big men.\" But we were left wondering if, in any case, does this at all line up with Lincoln\u2019s position on taxes? As it turns out, not really.", "Lincoln and taxes", "Well, Lincoln signed the first federal income taxes into law in 1861 in order to fund the Civil War. What\u2019s more is that these taxes were progressive -- meaning that the wealthier people paid higher tax rates on their income. The highest rate -- 5 percent -- applied to incomes roughly equivalent to $1 million today, Prokopowicz told PolitiFact in an email.", "\"To the extent that signing the bill indicated his approval, Lincoln thus approved of the concept of higher taxes on the wealthy,\" he said. \"This is consistent with Lincoln's politics generally.\"", "(Quick note: Kasich was talking about capital gains taxes specifically, and here we\u2019re talking about income tax. Until 1921, capital gains were taxed at the same rate as ordinary income.)", "Lincoln\u2019s Treasury Secretary Salmon Chase came up with the idea for the tax, which is further evidence that Lincoln supported higher taxes on the wealthy, said Geoff Elliot, expert and author of the Abraham Lincoln Blog. He added that a subsequent act in 1862 created the precursor to the Internal Revenue Service", "Much of the debate over the Civil War income tax laws centered around whether\u00a0Lincoln had the constitutional authority to impose these taxes, said Jennifer Weber, a Lincoln expert at the University of Kansas. (In 1881, the Supreme Court held up Lincoln\u2019s authority.)", "In a reminder of how much political parties have changed, Weber noted that it was the conservative Democrats taking Lincoln, a Republican,\u00a0to task over executive overreach and implementing taxes.", "There is \"precious little\" record of Lincoln\u2019s views on taxes, said Ed Steers, author of several books on the Lincoln assassination. But he pointed us to a speech Lincoln delivered to the 164th Ohio Infantry in 1864, where he advocated for the progressive tax law.", "Lincoln said: \"It is fair that each man shall pay taxes in exact proportion to the value of his property; but if we should wait before collecting a tax, to adjust the taxes on each man in exact proportion with every other man, we should never collect any tax at all. \"", "Prokopowicz added that Lincoln believed strongly in \"opportunity capitalism\" and that the government should not adopt policies that would prevent anyone from acquiring wealth. However, Lincoln also believed that the government had a vital role in creating opportunity, and individuals ought to contribute to the government in order to reap its benefits.", "\"I go for all sharing the privileges of the government, who assist in bearing its burthens,\" Lincoln wrote in 1836 while running for the Illinois state Legislature.", "Our ruling", "Kasich said that Lincoln said, \"You can\u2019t build a little guy up by tearing the big guy down.\"", "It\u2019s well-established that this is not a Lincoln quote. Many have misattributed it to Lincoln, but its real author was a politically conservative minister and public speaker who was born several years after Lincoln\u2019s assassination.", "Additionally, Kasich used the idea to support his position against raising taxes on the wealthy.
