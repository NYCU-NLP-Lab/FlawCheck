Bush.\n\n What Obama did\n\nIn August 2011, the Obama administration issued new federal fuel economy rules that set an average fuel efficiency goal of 54.5 miles per gallon for the 2025 model year.\n\nThat\u2019s nearly twice the 27.6 miles per gallon standard for 2011, for cars and for trucks.\n\nSo far, so good.\n\nBut we paused at Obama\u2019s claim that his administration took action \"after 30 years of inaction.\"\n\nMileage standards in the United States have been in place since the 1970s Arab oil embargo.\n\nBack then, Congress passed the Energy Policy Conservation Act of 1975, which boosted the fuel economy of cars and light trucks. \"Corporate average fuel economy,\" or CAFE, standards reached 27.5 miles per gallon in 1985 \u2014 then hovered there.\n\nObama\u2019s speech might have left you thinking nothing else happened until his administration took charge.\n\nBut in 2007, Bush signed the Energy Independence and Securities Act, which required \"substantial, continuing increases in fuel economy standards,\" according to a helpful history lesson at auto information site Edmunds.com.\n\nBush noted at his signing ceremony that the law marked the first statutory increase in fuel economy standards since they were enacted \u2014 something he had asked for.\n\nRep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., then speaker of the House, remarked on the historic nature of the bipartisan legislation, writing that its auto efficiency reforms were \"the first in more than 30 years.\"\n\nAnd that law laid the groundwork for Obama\u2019s rule changes.\n\nBush\u2019s administration left for Obama\u2019s the job of finalizing standards, something it hadn\u2019t yet done \"because of the uncertainty gripping car companies,\" Reuters reported.\n\n\"A lot of what Obama's doing is really extending what President Bush started,\" Jeremy Anwyl, vice chairman for Edmunds.com, told PolitiFact in January.\n\nThat\u2019s not what Obama\u2019s sweeping oversimplification suggested.\n\nThe president also said that \"by the middle of the next decade, cars and trucks will go twice as far on a gallon of gas.\" That\u2019s what the new rules require. Edmunds.com reports that \"regulators, environmentalists and most automakers agree that existing technologies can be used to achieve this plan's goals.\" There\u2019s just debate about their cost. While automakers have so far met boosted standards by updating traditional engines, Anwyl says those relatively inexpensive gains won't carry companies through lofty goals set for 2025.\n\nStill, 13 automakers in August announced support for the new standards, signaling they believe they\u2019ll be able to achieve the gains.\n\n Our ruling\n\nObama said, \"After 30 years of inaction, we raised fuel standards so that by the middle of the next decade, cars and trucks will go twice as far on a gallon of gas.\" The Obama administration launched new fuel efficiency standards that significantly raise the bar for automakers over the next decade.\n\nBut the rules, which raise standards from their 1985 levels, grew from a bipartisan law requested and signed by Bush. We\u2019ll give Obama credit for pushing for a long-term agreement with aggressive goals and working with automakers who say they\u2019ll get it done. But he\u2019s on shakier ground when he gives the impression his administration was solely responsible.
