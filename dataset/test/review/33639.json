And suicide rates are higher for male veterans than female veterans.", "The report found that suicide is likeliest among younger veterans of both sexes and among older male veterans. But since these groups account for a relatively small share of the total veteran population, the largest number of suicides occur among the much larger population of middle-aged veterans.", "A 2018 update by the VA found that the average number of veteran suicides per day had remained \"unchanged at 20.\"", "We checked with Robert Bossarte, the director of Injury Control Research at West Virginia University who helped author the VA\u2019s 2016 report.
