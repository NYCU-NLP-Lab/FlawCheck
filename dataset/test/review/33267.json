["By Lori Robertson", "Posted on February 11, 2020", "Several days after Sen. Mitt Romney was the lone Republican vote to convict President Donald Trump of abuse of power in the impeachment trial, the president used his Twitter account to spread dubious and unfounded viral claims about the Utah senator.", "We asked the White House for support for these claims, but we haven\u2019t received a response.", "Trump retweeted posts attempting to tie Romney to Burisma, the Ukrainian gas company on whose board former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, served from 2014 to 2019. As we\u2019ve written before, Trump has twisted the facts on the Bidens and Ukraine. The president\u2019s request that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky investigate the Bidens was at the heart of the whistleblower complaint against Trump and his impeachment in the House and subsequent acquittal in the Senate.", "Romney\u2019s vote in the impeachment saga came on Feb. 5, and days later, he found himself the target of Trump\u2019s retweets.", "One of the posts the president retweeted was a meme that makes the unfounded claim \u201cRomney\u2019s son\u201d \u2014 as well as the sons of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and former Secretary of State John Kerry \u2014 \u201care all on the board of directors for energy companies doing business in Ukraine.\u201d We looked into those assertions in October and found no evidence that any of those political leaders\u2019 sons worked for energy companies based in, or \u201cdoing business in,\u201d Ukraine.", "Romney has five sons, who work in finance, real estate and radiology, as we explained. The senator\u2019s office declined to comment when we wrote that story, saying only that the claims were \u201cfake news from random online trolls.\u201d", "We reached out to Romney\u2019s office again, now that the president has spread the viral meme, but we haven\u2019t received a response.", "Trump also retweeted a post from the conservative site Big League Politics, which claims Romney is \u201ctied\u201d to Burisma because a former adviser to his 2012 presidential campaign was on the company\u2019s board. That\u2019s an awfully thin \u201ctie.\u201d", "The linked story, posted in September, notes that Joseph Cofer Black \u2014 a \u201cspecial adviser\u201d under the Romney campaign\u2019s foreign policy and national security team \u2014 joined the Burisma board in 2017. Black, a former director of the CIA\u2019s counterterrorist center and State Department coordinator for counterterrorism who served under both the George W. Bush and Bill Clinton administrations, did join the Burisma board in 2017, as reported in the Kyiv Post.", "This is a classic guilt-by-association claim. There\u2019s no evidence Romney had anything to do with Black getting a position on Burisma\u2019s board five years after his presidential campaign. Black was one of 24 special advisers to the campaign on foreign policy and national security.", "The Big League Politics post credited the conservative site the American Thinker with discovering these so-called \u201cconnections\u201d between Romney and Burisma.", "These claims went viral in the fall, after Romney had expressed concern about the president\u2019s actions. On Sept. 22, after news reports said Trump had pressured Zelensky to investigate Hunter Biden in a July 25 phone call, Romney said on Twitter that \u201cit would be troubling in the extreme\u201d if Trump had asked for an investigation, \u201ceither directly or through his personal attorney.\u201d Romney added: \u201cCritical for the facts to come out.\u201d", "Four days later, the American Thinker and Big League Politics posts attempted to link the senator to Burisma.", "The Washington Post wrote in October about the spread of such claims online and through social media, saying the episode \u201cserves as a preview of the viral attacks likely to be unleashed on GOP lawmakers if they buck their president during an impeachment showdown that Trump has denounced as a \u2018coup.\u2019\u201d And, in fact, after Romney voted for one article of impeachment, these dubious claims are spreading again, getting a boost from the president.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
