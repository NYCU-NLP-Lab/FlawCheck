["By Robert Farley", "Posted on February 21, 2019", "President Donald Trump misleadingly claimed that \u201cdeficits seem to be coming down,\u201d when in fact deficits are rising, largely because of the tax cuts he enacted.", "In fact, the deficit in the first three months of fiscal year 2019 was 42 percent higher than it was for the same period last year.", "Trump\u2019s comment came as the president boasted about the country\u2019s strong economy during a signing ceremony for a space policy directive.", "Trump, Feb. 19: I don\u2019t know if you noticed, but deficits seem to be coming down. And last month it was reported, and everybody was surprised, but I wasn\u2019t surprised. We\u2019re taking in a lot of money coming into our Treasury from tariffs and various things, including the steel dumping. And our steel companies are doing really well. Aluminum companies also. So we\u2019re very happy about that.", "The White House press office did not respond to our request for clarification or backup data, but the president appeared to be referring to the latest monthly deficit tabulation released by the Treasury Department. In December, the U.S. government ran a relatively low deficit of $13.5 billion, Treasury announced this month. That\u2019s nearly $10 billion less than the previous December.", "But the total deficit for the first three months of the fiscal year, ending in December, was $319 billion. (See Table 1.) That\u2019s 42 percent higher than in the first three months of FY 2018. (See Table 2.)", "Even so, experts told us it is unwise to cherry-pick a single month or even several months, as federal revenue and spending often fluctuate cyclically at different times of the year. It is better to look at the longer-term, yearly deficits, and the trend line there is clear: Deficits have increased under Trump, and they are forecast to continue to go up, according to projections by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.", "\u201cDecember is almost always a relatively good month for the federal government,\u201d Shai Akabas, director of economic policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center, told us in a phone interview. Fewer federal payments go out the door, and so historically deficits in Decembers are usually relatively low. The federal government shutdown also skewed the government\u2019s bottom line that month. The deficit for January, which Treasury has not yet released, is also likely to be relatively low, and may even be a surplus, he said. Quarterly tax payments due in January typically give revenues that month a large bump.", "\u201cLooking at one month and saying deficits are getting better is like looking at the weather in November and December and saying the climate is getting colder,\u201d Akabas said.", "December\u2019s figure is not indicative of the long-term trend, he said. \u201cDeficits are rising significantly.\u201d", "The federal deficit in FY 2018, which ended Sept. 30, was $779 billion \u2014 a nearly 17 percent increase from FY 2017.\u00a0According to the Congressional Budget Office, about $164 billion of the 2018 deficit resulted from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\u00a0\u2014 a\u00a0Republican-crafted bill that the president signed\u00a0into law on Dec. 22, 2017.", "Revenue loss from the tax bill is expected to have an even larger impact on the deficit this year. According to the latest economic forecast from the Congressional Budget Office, released in January, the federal budget deficit is expected to reach nearly $900 billion this fiscal year (a 15 percent increase from 2018) and exceed \u201c$1 trillion each year beginning in 2022.\u201d", "The White House, in its mid-session review\u00a0of the fiscal year 2019 budget, estimates even larger short-term deficits than CBO. That document projects annual deficits will top $1 trillion in fiscal years 2019, 2020 and 2021.", "\u201cYou can\u2019t look at a single month to tell you much of anything\u201d Marc Goldwein, senior vice president and senior policy director at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, told us via email. \u201cOverall, deficits are way up since the President took office.\u201d", "CRFB says the tax bill is the largest driver of increasing deficits, but increased spending, particularly on defense, also has played a role.", "\u201cThe deficit is not going down,\u201d\u00a0Steve Ellis of the budget watchdog group Taxpayers for Common Sense told us via email. \u201cIt\u2019s not very useful to look at the deficit from month to month or even the same month year to year. The last month had some saving because of the government shutdown, but that is going to be more than made up going forward.\u201d", "The timing of payments and even variables such as the number of weekends in a month has an effect on monthly deficits, Ellis said.", "\u201cThe real measure of the deficit is as a percentage of GDP,\u201d Ellis said. \u201cBottom line, since WWII the only other times the deficit has been this high was immediately after WWII and immediately after the Great Recession. But we have this level of deficits during an economic expansion, that\u2019s unconscionable.\u201d", "According to the latest economic forecast from the Congressional Budget Office, \u201cOver the coming decade, deficits \u2026 [will] fluctuate between 4.1 percent and 4.7 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), well above the average over the past 50 years,\u201d and will average 4.4 percent a year from 2020 to 2029.", "By comparison, CBO said: \u201cOver the past 50 years, the annual deficit has averaged 2.9 percent of GDP.", "The Trump administration contests the CBO projection. In a press briefing on Jan. 28, Larry Kudlow, director of the White House National Economic Council, said the White House simply disagrees with CBO about projected economic growth and, in turn, its deficit projections.", "Kudlow, Jan. 28: So they [CBO] have had a very low growth estimate in response to Trump policies on taxes and deregulation, and we\u2019ve had a much higher one \u2014 about a 1-percentage point differential, more or less. We\u2019re at 3; they\u2019re at 2, more or less.", "The\u00a0White House budget\u00a0for fiscal year 2019 assumed \u201creal Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth averaging 3.0 percent during the 11-year forecast interval,\u201d from 2018 to 2028.", "But few outside the White House share such a rosy view. The\u00a0most recent median forecast\u00a0of the\u00a0Federal Reserve Board\u00a0members and Federal Reserve Bank presidents issued on Dec. 19 projected 3.0 percent growth for all of 2018, 2.3 percent in 2019 and 2.0 percent in 2020. Similarly, among the business and university economists who offered an annual GDP forecast\u00a0to the\u00a0Wall Street Journal\u2019s monthly economic survey\u00a0in January, the average prediction was for 3.0 percent growth for all of 2018, falling to 2.2 percent this year and 1.7 percent next year.", "Trump asserted that increased revenues from \u201ctariffs and various things\u201d are bringing down the deficit, but increased revenues from tariffs are dwarfed by revenue losses from the tax cuts.", "In the first three months of this fiscal year, the federal government took in about $17.8 billion in \u201ccustoms duties\u201d \u2014 about $8.4 billion more than during the same three months last year, according to the Treasury (Table 7). CBO says\u00a0that increase in customs duties was \u201clargely because of new tariffs imposed by the Administration during the past year.\u201d By contrast, however, the CBO forecasts revenue losses from the tax cuts of $228 billion this year, and $272 billion in FY 2020.", "\u201cTariffs definitely bring in some revenue,\u201d Akabas said. \u201cBut in the scheme of things, they are quite small, several billion dollars as opposed to deficits of several hundred billion dollars.\u201d", "The long-term, big picture on deficits is clear, Akabas said. Deficits are rising under Trump, and in the years ahead, \u201cThe CBO projects rising deficits with no end in sight.\u201d", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
