["Nonsense dressed up in statistical jargon is still nonsense.", "And that\u2019s what we find in the Texas attorney general\u2019s unprecedented lawsuit asking the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn election results in Wisconsin, Georgia, Michigan and Pennsylvania.", "A claim gaining particular traction online purports to calculate the likelihood of those four states \u2014 all won by Democrat Joe Biden \u2014 shifting away from President Donald Trump, who led earlier in the vote-counting process.", "\u201cThe probability of former Vice President Biden winning the popular vote in the four Defendant States \u2014 Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin \u2014 independently given President Trump\u2019s early lead in those States as of 3 a.m. on November 4, is less than one in a quadrillion, or 1 in 1,000,000,000,000,000,\u201d says the lawsuit, citing calculations by Charles J. Cicchetti.", "Claims about this 1 in a quadrillion chance spread widely on Facebook after the Dec. 8\u00a0lawsuit. White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany repeated the claim that day, as did articles on various conservativewebsites.", "As proof, the lawsuit attached a \u201cdeclaration\u201d from Cicchetti presenting his justification for this claim, describing his hypothesis testing and calculation of Z-scores and p-values.", "But statistical calculations are only as good as the assumptions underpinning them, and Cicchetti\u2019s are wildly wrong.", "Fact check:Trump lost the 2020 presidential election", "Let\u2019s take a closer look.", "Cicchetti\u2019s analysis flops because he makes the same error in multiple ways \u2014 assuming any two large groups of voters should generate substantially similar results.", "But, groups can split drastically by geography. In Wisconsin, for example, Milwaukee County and Ozaukee County are next to each other, but one went 69% for Biden and the other 55% for Trump because demographics in the two counties are very different.", "And groups can split by voting method. Across the 20 states that report votes by party registration, when it came to in-person voting, Republicans led by a 42% to 36% margin in November\u2019s election (with 22% listing no affiliation), while Democrats had a 48% to 27% edge in mail-in balloting (with 25% listing no affiliation), according to the U.S. Elections Project.", "So a key part of understanding why early and late returns differ is looking at where those votes came from and how they were cast. This claim ignores that question altogether to treat each vote as if it were a coin flip.", "Kenneth Mayer, professor of political science at the University of Wisconsin Madison, said Cicchetti\u2019s approach is \u201cludicrous.\u201d", "\u201cThe analysis assumes that votes are all independently and randomly distributed,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cThis is going to be used in undergraduate statistics classes as a canonical example of how not to do statistics.\u201d", "Fact check:Biden won the most total votes \u2014 and the fewest total counties \u2014\u00a0of any president-elect", "The observed party split by voting method is key to understanding the absurdity of this claim.", "Cicchetti\u2019s defense \u2014 in a description of his methodology attached to the lawsuit \u2014 focuses primarily on Georgia, noting Trump was leading 51% to 49% at 3 a.m. on Nov. 4 but wound up narrowly losing the state.", "\u201cThe Georgia reversal in the outcome raises questions because the votes tabulated in the two time periods could not be random samples from the same population of votes cast,\u201d Cicchetti says.", "While he's close to getting it right, Cicchetti ends up getting it wrong.", "The issue is indeed that votes from before and after that point can\u2019t be random samples. But it\u2019s not because of fraud as the lawsuit suggests \u2014 it\u2019s because of which votes were counted when.", "In Georgia, the secretary of state announced late morning Nov. 4 that about 200,000 absentee ballots had yet to be counted, most from DeKalb and Fulton counties around Atlanta. DeKalb ended up going 83% for Biden, and Fulton 73% for Biden, so of course adding in the votes from those areas moved the vote total in Biden\u2019s direction.", "Cicchetti\u2019s explanation says there was \u201cspeculation\u201d that those last ballots counted were absentee ballots, but he wasn\u2019t \u201caware of any actual data supporting that.\u201d That is ridiculous and false.", "Cicchetti did not respond to an email seeking further information on his methodology.", "The same thing played out in Wisconsin, where 170,000 absentee ballots in Milwaukee were among the last large blocks of votes reported. As has been noted by PolitiFact, this late swing toward Biden was anything but a surprise.", "In fact, each of the four states cited in the Texas lawsuit (and Cicchetti\u2019s analysis) don\u2019t allow absentee votes to be counted before Election Day.", "This causes a bottleneck particularly in the\u00a0most populous counties \u2014 which are, of course, centered around heavily Democratic cities. Those areas were long expected to be the last to report their results, and that\u2019s just what happened with results from around Atlanta, Milwaukee, Detroit and Philadelphia.", "Cicchetti\u2019s methodology doesn\u2019t defend his \u201cone in a quadrillion\u201d number specifically for Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan aside from noting each state had between 69% and 89% of the vote tabulated before the latest reports. He says that leaves a large enough sample size of uncounted ballots that we should \u201cexpect comparable percentages and vote margins\u201d before and after that point.", "Again, this ignores the indisputable fact that those were votes from dramatically different groups of voters.", "\u201cCicchetti doesn\u2019t even provide the relevant probability (in his methodology). He doesn\u2019t consider obvious alternative explanations. And he makes a basic error in interpretation,\u201d Justin Grimmer, a Stanford University professor of political science, said on Twitter. \u201cI\u2019m sure this claim will now become canon in election-conspiracy media, particularly given that Trump retweeted it. I\u2019m frankly embarrassed that such statistical incompetence would appear in such a high profile venue.\u201d", "More:Trump seeks to join Supreme Court lawsuit challenging election results in 4 key states", "Margins move throughout the counting process in every election since, as the Washington Post noted Dec. 9 in rebutting this claim, \u201cStates aren\u2019t homogeneous entities with one Democrat and one Republican in each square meter of space.\u201d And they move in both directions.", "The lawsuit fails to note, for example, that Biden was ahead as the first 80% of ballots were counted in North Carolina, but ultimately lost the state to Trump because the outstanding votes were in heavily Republican areas.", "USA TODAY\u00a0reached out to three of the websites that\u00a0amplified the quadrillion claim. We did not hear back from BPR Business & Politics or American Wire, but a PJ Media reporter\u00a0replied to note his story linked to the Grimmer's critique. That was tucked in at the end\u00a0of a story that otherwise passed along Cicchetti's claims as fact.", "Fact check:Joe Biden has secured enough electors from certified results to be elected president", "As a quick aside, we\u2019ll note the lawsuit makes a similar claim of a \u201cless than one in a quadrillion\u201d chance that Biden would perform as he did in Wisconsin, Michigan, Georgia and Pennsylvania given Democrat Hillary Clinton\u2019s performance in those states in 2016.", "That\u2019s equally ridiculous.", "We\u2019ll let the Washington Post take it away on this one:", "It\u2019s completely unclear where this number comes from. Particularly since Biden\u2019s improvements over the 2016 Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, were fairly modest in those four states. Clinton lost to Trump by about 290,000 votes across the four states; Biden won them by about 270,000. That\u2019s a swing of about a third of a percentage point relative to all of the votes cast in 2020. Yes, Biden got more votes than Clinton, averaging about 23 percent more votes across the four states. But Trump added an average of 16 percent more votes.", "We rate this claim FALSE because it is not supported by our research.\u00a0What masquerades as a statistical analysis is actually a logical wasteland that ignores fundamental facts that make all the difference.", "The votes still uncounted when Trump had his short-lived lead were largely absentee ballots from major cities. Those cities have consistently voted Democratic historically, and mail-in votes within them should be expected to lean even more that direction since Trump had attacked that method of voting leading up to the election while Biden encouraged it.", "Contact Eric Litke at (414) 225-5061 or elitke@jrn.com.
