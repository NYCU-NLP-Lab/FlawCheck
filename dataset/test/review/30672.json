This is when the stone-pelting and arson started. I observed the riots from a vantage point until 6 pm.

The report that claims to be a fact-finding report has five accounts of misinformation that was fact-checked by independent media organisations. It heavily relies on OpIndia, a website that has repeatedly shared misinformation. Several sections in the report, particularly the witness testimonies, indicate that the committee relied on inputs from just one community in its efforts to build a narrative that the Muslim community was responsible for the communal riots.", "Update: One of the members of the fact-finding committee sent a rejoinder to our article. We are reproducing it in full below. Alt News stands by its report.", "\u201cA team of professionals headed by the Retired High Court Judge of Mumbai High Court has conducted the inquiry of Delhi Riots on behalf of the NGO \u2018Call for Justice\u2019 with an approach to bring the factual information to the public and stakeholders. Alt News questions the committee report on selective and convenient issues and refrains from commenting on unsuitable aspects of the report as the media reports of the investigation has already corroborated broadly the finding of the committee to a larger extent. The committee would like to remark that the self- proclaimed fact checking website ignores the entirety of the report and focuses on isolated parts, suitable to their own narrative. For example, the website goes on to give a clean chit to transgressors like Amanatullah Khan on one aspect, and very carefully ignores other videos in which Khan can be seen misleading and inciting people, instances which are more or less indefensible. Another instance is where Alt News quotes the person seen distributing money to women in a video, saying that he was distributing money to the riot affected families but intentionally and conveniently overlooked the fact that this averment is also corroborated from the testimony of another witness and inference has been drawn taking into account totality of the facts and not from any one particular evidence. Further, the involvement of Umar Khalid has already been established by Delhi Police in the charge sheet filed against Tahir Hussain wherein, it was observed that Tahir Hussain was in contact with Umar Khalid who was part of a larger group of person involved in inciting riots in Delhi. Another example is the claim that the entire report presents a misleading sequence of events despite the fact that the authenticity of entire timeline of activities has been corroborated from the media reports and other evidences referred therein in the report itself. The website claims that the finding of the report that 7000 people had gathered from outside for riots, is misleading without appreciating the fact that it was based on the testimony of the witness. Further, the allegation of sourcing dubious website for information is mischievous as the committee has toiled hard to disclose the sources of information to substantiate its findings and refer to the more than 100 footnotes, which are either the links to news reports or the details of any video / photo/ other source. Alt News challenge only 10 which belong to OpIndia and suppressed the fact that the report also puts out its source of information on India Today, The Scroll, National Herald, The Hindu, The Indian Express, The Print, The Wire, Outlook, NDTV, and many other media houses which play a huge role in the Indian political discourse. The allegations of one sided fact-finding are false as apart from the testimonies, the committee have taken into consideration the images, videos, media reports and other content from the public domain. As far as the few testimonies from the other community, there are two reasons for this, firstly, the committee visited the riot affected areas on 29 th February, 2020 & 1 st March, 2020 and a few person from the other community volunteered to testify before the committee and in some areas, there were safety issues and the police stopped the committee from visiting those areas. Imagine the police fearing for safety! It is no secret that even journalists were targeted when they attempted to cover the initial barrage of attacks on the Hindu community. And lastly, all the issues challenging the fact finding report are so trivial in nature and do not impinge on the fabric of the report in any manner and instead fortify the outcome of the report of committee. Thus the present criticism of the report is unwarranted and have been done by adopting a \u2018between the lines approach\u2019 and based on trivial issues in isolation without appreciating the fact that these findings are supported and backed by many corroborative evidences at every instance and subsequently by the police investigation also as such, the criticiser are just making a fuss out of nowhere. The report have maintained neutrality in its finding and nowhere has given the communal colour and in-fact accusation was against the anti-national, extremist and radical groups behind the riots.
