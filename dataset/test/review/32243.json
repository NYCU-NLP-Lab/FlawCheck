["President Donald Trump boards Air Force One at Palm Beach International Airport on Dec. 31, 2020, in West Palm Beach, Fla. (AP/Semansky)", "Georgia officials have repeatedly debunked false claims alleging that \u201csuitcases\u201d of fraudulent ballots were secretly counted at Atlanta\u2019s State Farm Arena.", "Those officials have said there was never an instruction for election observers to leave, and that there were no suitcases full of ballots. A video shows standard ballot containers and what officials described as the normal tabulation process.", "The Election Day water leak at State Farm Arena happened hours earlier.", "In an hour-long phone call pressuring Georgia\u2019s secretary of state to overturn the results of the election, President Donald Trump rehashed the debunked claim that election workers in Atlanta were caught on tape secretly counting \"suitcases\" full of fraudulent ballots behind closed doors.", "State and county officials have said the surveillance video Trump mentioned shows normal ballot processing. But Trump stood by his inaccurate version of events during the Jan. 2 call, which was first reported by the Washington Post.", "\"That was the tape that\u2019s been shown all over the world that makes everybody look bad, you, me and everybody else,\" Trump said to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, according to the recording.", "In Trump\u2019s telling, the Nov. 3 tape showed that after a \"major water main break\" at Atlanta\u2019s State Farm Arena, where Fulton County election workers were counting ballots, \"everybody fled the area.\"", "With Republican election observers gone, the county\u2019s election workers returned, Trump said. They reached under a table and pulled out \"suitcases or trunks\" full of ballots that were hidden there hours earlier, he said, and they secretly tallied \"18,000 ballots, all for (Joe) Biden.\"", "Trump\u2019s story aligns with the false narrative that Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani and his team pushed when they introduced the tape during a Dec. 3 hearing with state legislators.", "What actually happened, according to Georgia and Fulton County officials, is much different.", "Gabriel Sterling, a Republican and Georgia\u2019s voting system implementation manager, has addressed the \"suitcases\" claim in social media postings, TV interviews, and press conferences since Dec. 4, when he tweeted that the video showed \"normal ballot processing.\"", "In a Jan. 4 press conference ahead of Georgia\u2019s runoff Senate election, Sterling spent minutes rebutting Trump\u2019s claim, which he called \"thoroughly debunked.\" The sequence of events he described lined up with what PolitiFact and multiple other fact-checkers have reported.", "In reality, the ballots seen in the surveillance footage were not in suitcases or trunks. They were in \"normal absentee ballot carriers,\" Sterling said.", "The ballots were removed from their envelopes while news media personnel and observers were still in the room, and there was no formal announcement for observers to leave. But some observers took off once the election workers responsible for cutting the envelopes open and verifying the ballots inside had finished their job and started packing up for the night.", "Workers tasked with scanning the ballots got instructions to keep going, and an independent monitor and investigator oversaw the ballot counting as it continued into the night, Sterling said.", "In an affidavit, Frances Watson, the Georgia secretary of state\u2019s chief investigator, wrote that the state\u2019s \"investigation and review of the entire security footage revealed that there were no mystery ballots that were brought in from an unknown location and hidden under tables.\"", "\"Around 10 p.m., with the room full of people, including official monitors and the media, video shows ballots that had already been opened but not counted placed in the boxes, sealed up, stored under the table,\" Watson wrote. \"When the counting continued into later in the night, those boxes were opened so that the ballots inside could then be counted.\"", "Sterling said he reviewed the full tape with a local reporter. \"The president\u2019s legal team had the entire tape, they watched the entire tape, and then from our point of view, intentionally misled the state Senate, voters and the people of the United States about this,\" Sterling said.", "There\u2019s no evidence that the ballots counted on election night were \"all for Biden,\" as Trump claimed, and a state monitor disputed that 18,000 votes were tallied during that window.", "There\u2019s also no connection between the \"suitcase\" allegation and a leak at State Farm Arena on Election Day. State Farm Arena reported that one room being used for ballot counting had been affected by a water leak at approximately 6 a.m., hours before the scene in question took place.", "Arena staff repaired the leak, which Sterling attributed to an overflowing urinal, in roughly two hours, according to the arena\u2019s statement. No ballots were damaged, the arena said.", "The Trump campaign and White House did not immediately respond to our inquiries.", "Trump claimed a tape\u00a0shows that after a \"major water main break\" in Georgia, election workers pulled out ballots stored in \"suitcases\" under a table and counted \"18,000 ballots, all for Biden\" with no election observers present. That\u2019s wrong in multiple ways.", "State and county officials have repeatedly debunked this claim. The video in question does not show any wrongdoing, and there\u2019s no evidence that the ballots shown were fraudulent or \"all for Biden.\" The water leak, which was sourced to a urinal, was unrelated.", "We rate this claim Pants on Fire!", "The Washington Post, \"\u2018I just want to find 11,780 votes\u2019: In extraordinary hour-long call, Trump pressures Georgia secretary of state to recalculate the vote in his favor,\" Jan. 3, 2021", "The Washington Post, \"Here\u2019s the full transcript and audio of the call between Trump and Raffensperger,\" Jan. 3, 2021", "Georgia Secure the Vote, \"Fact Check,\" accessed Jan. 4, 2021", "11ALive on YouTube, \"Georgia Sec of State Brad Raffensperger press conference after Trump call | Live,\" Jan. 4, 2021", "The Associated Press, \"AP FACT CHECK: Trump\u2019s made-up claims of fake Georgia votes,\" Jan. 4, 2021", "NBC News, \"Trump pushed QAnon and 4chan-created conspiracy theories in Georgia call,\" Jan. 4, 2021", "Snopes, \"Ruby Freeman Was Not Arrested by the FBI,\" Dec. 18, 2020", "USA Today, \"Fact check: Georgia 'suitcase' video is missing context,\" Dec. 14, 2020", "The Washington Post, \"Trump touts misleading video as \u2018proof\u2019 of Georgia voter fraud,\" Dec. 7, 2020", "The New York Times, \"Top Georgia election official debunks \u2018ridiculous\u2019 claims about election fraud,\" Dec. 7, 2020", "Affidavit from Frances Watson, Dec. 6, 2020", "FactCheck.org, \"Video Doesn\u2019t Show \u2018Suitcases\u2019 of Illegal Ballots in Georgia,\" Dec. 4, 2020", "Lead Stories, \"Fact Check: Video From Georgia Does NOT Show Suitcases Filled With Ballots Suspiciously Pulled From Under A Table; Poll Watchers Were NOT Told To Leave,\" Dec. 3, 2020", "State Farm Arena, \"Statement Regarding Absentee Ballot Tabulation at State Farm Arena,\" Nov. 3, 2020", "PolitiFact, \"No, Georgia election workers didn\u2019t kick out observers and illegally count \u2018suitcases\u2019 of ballots,\" Dec. 4, 2020", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
