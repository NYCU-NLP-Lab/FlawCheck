He told us that \"even under the most favorable assumptions, it\u2019s extremely unlikely\" that Friedrich Trump would have amassed the minimum of 30 points just to be considered for immigration. Syracuse University political science professor Elizabeth Cohen, whose specialties include immigration, called Friedrich\u2019s chances \"highly unlikely.\"", "Gwenda Blair, a Columbia University journalism adjunct faculty member and author of The Trumps: Three Generations of Builders and a President, helped us understand why Friedrich would have had such an uphill battle.

A few months later, she obtained an H-1B visa for skilled workers. There\u2019s some question about whether she did some modeling work before getting her H-1B visa as well as how she obtained a green card in 2001. She married Trump in 2006 and became a U.S. citizen. \"At best, Melania could probably score about 21 points, so there would be no visa for her,\" the article said.", "She did have more going for her than Friedrich did.", "English: Melania currently speaks English with a heavy accent, but it\u2019s one of five languages she\u2019s reportedly fluent in. There\u2019s no way to know, at the time she came to the United States, whether her English-speaking skills would have earned her zero points, 12, or some number in between.", "Education: Melania briefly studied architecture and design at the University of Ljubljana in Slovenia. But, according to Vanity Fair, she dropped out after winning runner-up in a beauty contest. So, for a high school diploma or the equivalent, that\u2019s one point.", "Job awaiting: At age 18, in Milan, Italy, Melania signed on with a modeling agency that said it sponsored the visa that brought her to New York in 1996. In New York in 1996, Melania would have needed a starting salary of at least $53,100 to earn any points, according to Cohen.", "Means: Another unknown is whether Melania could have brought along a large sum of money, even if that seems unlikely. Melania\u2019s father managed a chain of car and motorcycle dealerships, and her mother was either a fashion designer or a garment factory worker, according to the New York Post. She would have earned points if she could have come over with the current equivalent of more than $1.35 million.", "Legomsky, the Washington University law professor, pointed out that even if Melania amassed 30 points, which he said was unlikely, it would be difficult for her to be chosen for immigration given that more applicants would have much higher scores.
