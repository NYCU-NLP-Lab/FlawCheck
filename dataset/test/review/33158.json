(Chris) Christie has said of you, as soon as you felt the heat, you turned tail and run. Gov. (Jeb) Bush has said, \u2018I don't think we need people cutting and running anymore.\u2019 Did you fight for your own legislation, senator, or did you run from it?\"", "Rubio replied: \"We can\u2019t get that legislation passed. The American people will not support doing anything about people that are in this country illegally until the law is enforced first, and you prove it to them.\"", "Is that how the majority of Americans feel about changing immigration laws?

It included significant hurdles, including fines and a waiting period. The bill passed the Senate in 2013 but stalled in the House after leadership refused to bring it up for a vote. Since then, Rubio has called for a piecemeal approach that emphasizes border security first.", "Recent polls have asked people if they support a path to legal status for undocumented immigrants. That would allow them to work and pay taxes, but they would not be able to vote, for example, which would require citizenship.", "A May 2015 poll found broad public support for path to legal status, according to a report from the Pew Research Center.", "The poll found that 72 percent of Americans said that undocumented immigrants currently living in the United States should be allowed to stay in the country legally, if certain requirements are met.

Also, far more Republicans view immigrants as a burden, 63 percent, than view them as an asset for the country, 27 percent.\"", "Other 2015 polls also showed broad support for giving illegal immigrants a path to legal status.", "A Pew survey done in September 2015 found that \"majorities across all demographic and partisan groups favor providing legal status to undocumented immigrants.
