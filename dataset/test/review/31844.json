But let\u2019s start with what is the Cabinet.", "The Cabinet has 16 members who are in the official line of succession to the presidency -- the vice president, plus the heads of 15 executive departments, such as the secretary of state and the secretary of defense. However, seven more positions \"have the status of Cabinet-rank.\" They include the White House chief of staff and the head of the Environmental Protection Agency.", "To back Pocan\u2019s claim, his office cited an article posted the day before his radio interview by a website called Quartz, which describes itself as a news outlet founded in 2012 \"for business people in the new global economy.\"", "The article examined the wealth of 17 Trump selections -- 13 Cabinet members, plus four Cabinet-rank positions.
