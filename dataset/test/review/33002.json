["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on February 23, 2021", "The U.S. Department of Energy approved a request to allow power plants in snowstorm-battered Texas to temporarily bypass some environmental limits during its energy crisis, in order to produce more power. Viral headlines falsely claim the department rejected the request.", "On Feb. 14, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas sent a letter to the U.S. Department of Energy requesting an emergency order to permit power plants in its market \u201cto operate up to their maximum generation output levels,\u201d within some limitations.", "ERCOT runs the grid that serves the vast majority of Texas, and the state was facing down an energy crisis brought on by freezing temperatures and a severe winter storm \u2014 which left millions without power.", "Later that same day, Acting Secretary of Energy David Huizenga issued an order approving ERCOT\u2019s request.", "On social media, however, viral headlines and social media posts are falsely proclaiming that the department rejected the request.", "The website InfoWars ran a Feb. 20 headline, \u201cSmoking Gun! Joe Biden\u2019s Dept. of Energy Blocked Texas from Increasing Power Ahead of Killer Storm.\u201d That story was shared more than 8,500 times on Facebook, according to CrowdTangle analytics data.", "\u201cBiden Admin Refused Texas Governor\u2019s Request to Run Power at Full Capacity,\u201d reads a Feb. 22 headline on the website of a Texas-based radio show, \u201cWalton And Johnson.\u201d The author of the story also\u00a0took to Facebook to baselessly blame Biden for the reported deaths in Texas, saying the president \u201clet it happen.\u201d", "That radio show story \u2014 also shared nearly 8,000 times on Facebook before it was deleted \u2014 was premised entirely on a Twitter thread from Alexander Muse, who runs a conservative news aggregation website.", "\u201cThis thread is false,\u201d Michael Webber, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin who specializes in energy sources, told us in an email. \u201cDoE did not hinder Texas\u2019 response.\u201d", "As we said, the request in question came from ERCOT \u2014 not Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, as Muse and the radio show claim. (It\u2019s worth noting that, as we reported, Biden on Feb. 14 approved Abbott\u2019s\u00a0request for an emergency declaration for Texas, thereby allowing federal funds and the\u00a0Federal Emergency Management Agency to aid in the state\u2019s response.)", "The DOE\u2019s Huizenga signed the electric emergency order late on Feb. 14, putting it into effect through Feb. 19. The order permitted power plants to temporarily exceed certain environmental restrictions in order to reach maximum output during times of energy emergency alerts by ERCOT.", "In a notice, ERCOT notified market participants of the approval.", "The InfoWars story and Muse\u2019s Twitter thread also wrongly claim that it was the federal government that floated a cost of $1,500/MWh for the additional energy produced. \u201cBiden\u2019s EPA \u2026 instead offered to allow certain power generation facilities a waiver if they raised the prices they charged to Texans to more than $1,500/MWh resulting in massive statewide power outages and a failure of the grid,\u201d Muse said in a tweet.", "That, too, is wrong.", "That figure actually originated in ERCOT\u2019s initial request, and was then included in the DOE order. The request to DOE said that, if an electric-generating unit was unable to produce its maximum output because of an emissions restriction or \u201cother limit in any federal environmental permit,\u201d then the operator would be able to bypass those restrictions \u2014 but that the \u201cincremental amount of restricted capacity would be offered at a price no lower than $1,500/MWh.\u201d", "The letter later referred to this pricing as \u201ca separate mechanism to help ensure this capacity is deployed only when absolutely necessary.\u201d", "Webber, the professor at the University of Texas at Austin, said that cost was a \u201cminimum price\u201d that would ensure plants permitted to bypass environmental restrictions were not given an unfair advantage.", "\u201cEmissions controls cost money,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be unfair to let some power plants turn off their emissions controls, which lowers their operational costs, and then to use that lower cost to underbid other generators who responsibly left their controls in place.\u201d", "Ted Kury, director of energy studies for the Public Utility Research Center at the University of Florida, said \u201cwhen wholesale prices get high, the market operator is actually hoping that this sends a signal to folks to stop using electricity.\u201d That works for, say, large companies \u2014 but it often ends up being punitive for residential customers.", "Kury told us in an email that, outside of a municipal or cooperative utility, different power supply companies compete for customers and structure charges differently.", "\u201cSome power suppliers charge customers every day based on the 24 hourly wholesale prices that day,\u201d Kury said. \u201cThese customers are fully exposed to the wholesale market and pay those costs immediately. Those situations comprise the news stories of \u2018sticker shock\u2019 you\u2019re reading about. Others will average these costs over longer periods of time, essentially sharing the wholesale market risk with customers.\u201d", "In other words, he said, the high cost of electricity generated during the emergency will be experienced by most Texans \u2014 though it won\u2019t be equally transparent for all.", "Muse\u2019s Twitter thread also falsely claims that \u201c[t]he truth is that the federal government controls how Texas generates electricity \u2013 the mix of sources and the capacity of each.\u201d", "Ari Peskoe, director of the Electricity Law Initiative at the Harvard Law School, told us in a phone interview that was wrong, too.", "\u201cIf you want to build a power plant in Texas \u2026 there are environmental limits\u201d such as rules regarding air emissions or water,\u201d he said. But \u201cthat doesn\u2019t dictate\u201d the types of power generation in Texas.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
