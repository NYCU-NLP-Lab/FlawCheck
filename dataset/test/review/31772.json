Information from the agency, a reliable source for job-related calculations, earlier helped us confirm that 1.04 million Texans were unemployed as of August 2011, the latest month for which such data were available.\n\nAlso correct, per the bureau: The state\u2019s August 2011 unemployment rate, 8.5 percent, was the highest Texas had experienced since the 9.3 percent rate reached in November 1986, nearly 25 years before.\n\nFinally, the unemployment rate has doubled during Perry\u2019s governorship -- going from 4.2 percent in December 2000 to 8.5 percent in August 2011.\n\nHowever, we rated a previous Romney claim to this effect Half True. Experts reminded us that governors have little to do with statewide job losses or gains that take place during their terms. Put another way, neither Romney nor Perry merits credit or blame for job conditions in their respective states. Economies rise and fall due to many conditions beyond a governor\u2019s sway. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThat should make the next debate a lot shorter, shouldn\u2019t it?\n\nThe logical weakness in blaming a state\u2019s governor for the state\u2019s jobless residents and unemployment rate makes Romney\u2019s triple-barreled claim Half True.", "Mitt Romney campaign website, Careerpolitician.com, accessed October 19, 2011\n\nMitt Romney campaign video, \"The Facts,\" published October 17, 2011\n\nPolitiFact Texas Truth-O-Meter item, \"Mitt Romney campaign says Texas unemployment doubled under Rick Perry,\" September 23, 2011\n\nU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, chart showing \"Current Unemployment Rates for States and Historical Highs/Lows\" and \u00a0Local Area Unemployment Statistics for Texas and Labor Force Statistics from the Current Population Survey (accessed September 22 and 23, 2011)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nChart showing Texas unemployment rates 2000-2011, generated on Bureau of Labor Statistics website September 22, 2011\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe New York Times, news article, \"Opposing Views on Perry as Job-Creating Master,\" Sept. 22, 2011\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nDallas Federal Reserve Bank, analysis, \"Texas Twist: Why Did State\u2019s Unemployment Fall Below Nation\u2019s?,\" third quarter 2010\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nPolitiFact Texas Truth-O-Meter article, \"Back to Basics PAC says Gov.
