["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "During Monday\u2019s Republican presidential debate in Manchester, N.H., former Sen. Rick Santorum blasted President Barack Obama\u2019s policies on oil drilling.\n\nSantorum said that Obama \"has put (up) a stop sign \u2026 against oil drilling, against any kind of exploration offshore or in Alaska, and that is depressing. We need to drill. We need to create energy jobs.\"\n\nWe took a look at a similar statement in March, when Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn. -- another GOP presidential contender -- told an audience at a conservative conference that \"the number of new drilling permits under the Obama Administration since they came into office\" is \"one.\" We ruled that statement Pants on Fire.\n\nWe\u2019ll refer back to our discussion of that claim here, updating it with more current information.\n\nThe most recent summary from Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement, or BOEMRE -- the federal agency that oversees drilling -- is included in a document titled the \"Status of Well Permits and Plans Subject to Enhanced Safety and Environmental Requirements.\"\n\nThe report says that 56 shallow-water permits for new wells have been issued since June 8, 2010, when new rules and information requirements were put into effect following the BP oil spill. Shallow-water drilling operations were not affected by the deep-water drilling moratorium following the spill.\n\nIn addition, since February of this year -- following the lifting of the moratorium and confirmation of the industry's ability to meet subsea containment requirements -- the government has approved 48 deep-water permits requiring subsea containment, covering 16 unique wells. Another 40 permits not requiring subsea containment have also been approved since October. The operators were required to come back and meet the modified standards.\n\nSo there\u2019s been movement on offshore permits in the Gulf of Mexico under Obama. What about drilling elsewhere?\n\nArctic Ocean exploratory drilling permits continue to wend their way through the permitting process at the Department of Interior, said Richard Charter, a senior policy adviser for the environmental group Defenders of Wildlife.\n\nA chart from BOEMRE confirms that no new offshore wells have been drilled in Alaska since Obama took office. However, only one such well has been drilled in the past dozen years, including eight years when a Republican, George W. Bush was president. So the shortage of drilling in Alaska is not exclusively an Obama-related problem.\n\nObama did announce in May that he was directing the Interior Department to conduct annual lease sales in Alaska\u2019s National Petroleum Reserve. He also ordered a speed-up of seismic surveys of mid- and south-Atlantic coasts and new incentives for industry to develop unused leases both on and offshore.\n\nWe should note that while drilling permits haven\u2019t disappeared entirely, the pace of approval has slowed, in large part because Obama has made clear that he wants drilling to be done safely and in an environmentally sensitive fashion.\n\nLee Hunt, executive director of the International Association of Drilling Contractors, said in March that there has been a \"molasses effect\" with permitting by the Obama Administration. Even shallow-water permits have fallen from their prior level, despite not being directly affected by the post-spill moratorium. Meanwhile, permits for deep-water wells are likely to be a third of what was projected prior to the gulf spill.\n\nAndy Radford, senior policy adviser at the American Petroleum Institute, agreed that permit approvals dropped after the BP spill, but he added in March that the pace of permitting was picking up. \"We'll get to the new normal eventually,\" he said.\n\nAll in all, then, Santorum\u2019s claim is incorrect.\n\n\"None of this could be accurately even remotely characterized as a \u2018stop sign,\u2019\" said Charter of Defenders of Wildlife.\n\nWe agree. It\u2019s true that the Obama Administration pulled back the reins after the BP spill. But the administration has continued approving shallow-water wells, and it began to approve deep-water wells again after the moratorium was lifted six months ago. Just because the pace isn\u2019t as fast as some would like doesn\u2019t mean that Obama \"has put (up) a stop sign \u2026 against oil drilling, against any kind of exploration offshore or in Alaska.\" At most, it would be a yellow light, and Santorum\u2019s claim -- referring to curbs on \"any kind\" of exploration -- is over-broad. So we rate Santorum\u2019s claim False.", "CNN.com, debate transcript, June 13, 2011\n\nBureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement, \"Status of Drilling Permits Subject to Enhanced Safety and Environmental Requirements in the Gulf of Mexico,\" accessed June 14, 2011\n\nBureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement, \"OCS Wells Drilled by Year,\" accessed June 14, 2011\n\nWhite House, \"Protecting Families at the Pump and Expanding Responsible Domestic Oil Production,\" May 17, 2011\n\nPolitiFact, \"Michele Bachmann claims there has been just one new oil drilling permit issued since Obama took office,\" March 29, 2011", "Interview with Lee Hunt, executive director of the International Association of Drilling Contractors, March 29, 2011\n\nInterview with Andy Radford, senior policy advisor at the American Petroleum Institute, March 29, 2011", "E-mail interview with Daniel J.
