Furthermore, Rancourt\u2019s article links to a preprint of a flawed German study on mask-use in children.", "An editorial note preceding the German study, published on Research Square, advises: \u201cDue to multiple limitations, this study cannot demonstrate a causal relationship between mask wearing and the reported adverse effects in children.
