["About this rating", "Some Vegas hotels have donated rooms (or food) to healthcare workers and first responders who need to quarantine themselves away from home.

According to a ProPublica investigation, which analyzed all of the organization's properties, no evidence suggests the group is offering to help people who are the frontlines of the global pandemic.", "\"It is possible that the Trumps have engaged in unseen acts of charity connected to the pandemic,\" the ProPublica story reads. \"The Trumps, however, have not been known to hide deeds for which they might receive favorable public attention.\"", "According to the investigation, the Trumps\u2019 64-story, 1,282-room hotel in Las Vegas closed its doors in mid-March, complying with the governor's order.

The person said no one was available to take media inquiries nor comment on whether the hotel was donating rooms or food.", "Across the city, the abrupt shuttering of hotels and casinos in late March \"provided huge quantities of unused food to the area\u2019s Three Square Food Bank,\" which helps low-income people get meals across Southern Nevada.", "The nonprofit's chief operating officer, Larry Scott, told ProPublica that it has received big donations from \"most all\" of the area hotels and casinos \u2014 including MGM, Wynn, Boyd Gaming, Station Casinos and Caesars, among others \u2014 but it has never received donations from the Trump Hotel. \u201cNo, they have not been a donor,\u201d Scott told ProPublica.", "But here's where the viral claim about Las Vegas hotel donations lacks truthfulness: Not all of the city's hotels have opened up rooms for first responders to quarantine themselves away from family or roommates, nor have they all donated food. An Extended Stay America, for example, is in that group.", "According to the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, at least 148 hospitality businesses offer short-stay rooms downtown or near the strip in Las Vegas.
