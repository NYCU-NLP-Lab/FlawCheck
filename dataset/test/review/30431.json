NASA says there\u2019s a greater than 95% probability that most of the current warming trend is the result of human activity since the mid-20th century. Increased levels of so-called greenhouse gases, like carbon dioxide, cause the Earth to warm by blocking heat from escaping the atmosphere and radiating it back toward the Earth\u2019s surface.", "Carbon dioxide can be released through, say, volcanic eruptions, but humans have also increased the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide by 47% since the Industrial Revolution started. Methane can likewise be produced through both natural sources and human activities, such as agriculture and livestock manure management.", "\"Human activities are changing the natural greenhouse,\" NASA says. \"Over the last century the burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil has increased the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). This happens because the coal or oil burning process combines carbon with oxygen in the air to make CO2. To a lesser extent, the clearing of land for agriculture, industry and other human activities has increased concentrations of greenhouse gases.\"", "We rate this Instagram post False.", "Instagram post, Feb. 11, 2021", "NASA, Global Climate Change, visited Feb. 16, 2021", "NASA, The causes of climate change, visited Feb. 16, 2021", "NASA, Scientific consensus: Earth\u2019s climate is warming, visited Feb. 16, 2021", "NASA, Climate change: How do we know?, visited Feb. 16, 2021", "NASA, Do scientists agree on climate change? visited Feb. 16, 2021", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
