But the headline and story failed to explain that his interest in those groups were not relevant to the alleged plot laid out in the government\u2019s complaint.", "FBI criminal complaint shows allegations against Jameson", "Here is what happened ahead of the planned incident, according to the FBI criminal complaint filed in California Dec. 22:", "In September, a confidential source alerted the FBI that Jameson\u2019s Facebook account showed he \"liked\" or \"loved\" pro-ISIS and terrorism posts, such as an image of Santa Claus standing in New York with a box of dynamite.", "Jameson, a recent convert to Islam, had expressed support for radical jihadist beliefs and terrorism, including the Oct. 31, 2017, terror attack in New York City in which a driver used a truck to kill eight people.", "\"I\u2019m glad to know we Muslims are finally hitting back,\" Jameson wrote on Facebook.", "In December an undercover FBI employee began communicating with Jameson, who believed the agent was part of senior leadership in ISIS. Jameson indicated that he wanted to plan an attack similar to the 2015 San Bernardino massacre and the recent New York truck attack.", "Jameson named the Pier 39 site in San Francisco as his target because it is a heavily crowded area. He asked the undercover employee to provide ammunition, assault rifle and materials to make explosives.", "A couple of days later, an FBI employee mistakenly called Jameson and he called back the employee\u2019s phone number which had a 202 (Washington, D.C.) area code. Later that day Jameson told the undercover FBI employee he reconsidered the attack.", "On Dec. 20, law enforcement conducted a search warrant and found an incriminating letter and several guns at Jameson\u2019s home. The letter included one mention of Trump -- a reference to Trump\u2019s recent recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel: \"You\u2019ve allowed Donald J. Trump to give away Al Quds to the Jews.\"", "Two days later, federal authorities announced that they had charged Jameson, a 26-year-old Modesto truck driver, with attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization.

Williams told PolitiFact that her office will investigate the possibility of an entrapment defense and whether the government can prove beyond a reasonable doubt any attempted criminal act since Jameson ultimately told an FBI undercover employee that he had reconsidered.", "\"In my understanding, the label \u2018antifa\u2019 means \u2018anti-fascist.\u2019 \u00a0If being anti-Trump, anti-fascist tends to show a person is more likely to be a \u2018terrorist\u2019 than not, the FBI must have a very long list of suspicious people,\" she told PolitiFact.", "Jameson\u2019s Facebook page", "The 11-page FBI criminal complaint and the press release from the U.S. Attorney make no mention of Antifa, and the only reference to Trump is the one sentence in the letter seized at Jameson\u2019s home. Mainstream news accounts of the case mentioned the sentence about Trump but nothing about Antifa.", "Antifa broadly describes far-left-leaning militant groups challenging neo-Nazis and white supremacists.", "Infowars drew from an archived version of Jameson\u2019s Facebook that showed he liked four Antifa groups -- three in California and one in Portland. He also liked a few anti-Trump groups, such as the \"Trump resistance movement.\" We noticed that Jameson liked hundreds of groups on Facebook ranging from the political (\"Sassy Socialist Memes\") to food, fashion, TV and sports.", "We asked spokespersons for the FBI and the U.S. Attorney if the fact that the complaint made no mention of Jameson liking anti-Trump and Antifa means that it was irrelevant from a law enforcement perspective, but authorities declined to answer that question.", "We posed the same question to a couple of experts on terrorism: Brian Levin at the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, and Erin Miller, at the Global Terrorism Database at the University of Maryland.", "Levin said federal authorities include information in the complaint that is relevant to the charge, which in this case was attempting to provide material support to foreign terrorist organizations.
