And just as in that prior example, the domain name of the purported anti-Trump website had just been obtained a few days earlier \u2014 not by Malia Obama or anyone associated with her, but by the same person responsible for the America's Last Line of Defense web site:", "Although the TRUMPSCREWED.US web site does exist, at the time of this writing it was just a duplicate of the faux NOTMYPOT.US site used in the earlier hoax meme. TRUMPSCREWED.US \u2014 along with the report that it was founded by Malia Obama \u2014 are simply fabrications created by America's Last Line of Defense, a site that is part of a network of fake news sites dedicated to spreading political misinformation and disinformation under the guise of proffering \"satire.\"", "The Fake News Codex. \u00a0 \u201cChristopher Blair Network.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Accessed 19 April 2018.", "David Mikkelson founded the site now known as snopes.com back in 1994.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
