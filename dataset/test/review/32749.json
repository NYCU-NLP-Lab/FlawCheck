Staffers Defect, Releasing Private Tape Recording That Has Trump Dead Silent.\u201d", "Facebook users flagged it as potentially false. It is.", "The headline was first published on a website called Bipartisan Report and was copied the next day by PoliticalBizz.com, which is registered to an owner in India, but posts stories about U.S. politics.", "The story under the headline is mostly a re-hashed Wall Street Journal report from a year ago that quoted three unnamed former Trump employees who said that as a businessman he had recorded calls in Trump Tower.", "Other major news outlets had similar stories at the time, which was right after Trump had suggested on Twitter that he might have recordings of his conversations with former FBI Director James Comey.", "Nearly a month-and-a-half later, the president backtracked, taking to Twitter to say: \u201cWith all of the recently reported electronic surveillance, intercepts, unmasking and illegal leaking of information, I have no idea\u2026 whether there are \u2018tapes\u2019 or recordings of my conversations with James Comey, but I did not make, and do not have, any such recordings.\u201d", "The Senate Committee on the Judiciary, which is investigating Trump\u2019s firing of Comey and whether his campaign colluded with Russia, has twice requested that the White House hand over any recordings it may have of Comey. The White House has not provided any recordings nor has it confirmed that it does not have any recordings, according to Sen. Dianne Feinstein\u2019s office. Feinstein is the top Democrat on the judiciary committee. Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley is the committee chairman, but his office didn\u2019t return our call.", "So, there\u2019s no evidence of White House tapes and it\u2019s not true that former staffers have released a tape.", "A search of the Nexis news database showed no results for reports of recently released tape recordings of Trump.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk false stories flagged by readers on the social media network.", "Access Hollywood. \u201cAccess Archive: Donald Trump\u2019s Shocking 2005 Comments About Women.\u201d AccessOnline.com. 7 Oct 2016.", "Cohen v.
