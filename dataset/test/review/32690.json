Republican Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) called the easement a \"tax racket\" in a report he released on 5 April 2017. His report included an explanation of how the deduction worked:", "To receive the tax break, a land deed is amended to include a \"conservation easement\" that is binding on \"current and future owners of the easement and the underlying property.\" The easement is then \"donated\" to a government agency or a nonprofit land trust.", "The property owner hand-picks the organization to which the easement will be donated and works out the terms for future uses of the property. The trusts rather than the federal government are then expected to enforce the\narrangements. Employees and board members of trusts have even donated easements to their own nonprofits while \"hundreds\u2014perhaps thousands\u2014of easements have been violated or altered at the request of landowners.\"", "The Senate has not voted on its version of the bill.
