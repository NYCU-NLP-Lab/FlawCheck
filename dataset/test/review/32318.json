["About this rating", "In January 2016, Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders' civil rights activism during his college years became a matter of dispute following a rumor -- proved to be false -- that an iconic photograph\u00a0of Martin Luther King, Jr. leading the famous 1965 civil rights march\u00a0from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama captured a young Sanders among the marchers.", "Soon afterwards, another photograph emerged that was said to show Sanders speaking to students on the first day of a sit-in at the University of Chicago in 1962:", "@cnn @CNNPolitics @FoxNews @MSNBC @BernieSanders Bring up Sanders sit-in to protest segregation at the school.! pic.twitter.com/iRs23p2y8u", "\u2014 WE the People!

It is Bruce Rappaport,\" referencing an article on the subject from\u00a0TIME magazine:", "Four University of Chicago alumni who went to school with Sanders tell TIME they believe that the dramatic photo of Sanders, which his campaign has featured on its website and in a promotional video, is not in fact a photograph of Sanders. An archivist at the University of Chicago agreed in January that Sanders was not the speaker in the photo, though the school\u2019s official decision on the man\u2019s identity is still pending.", "This wasn't just a case of misattribution by some anonymous detached onlooker viewing a photograph years after the fact and deciding that one the persons pictured looked like the Vermont senator -- Sanders himself had long been using the picture as part of his biographical material:", "The compelling picture can be found in the senator\u2019s biographical video on his campaign website. \u201cAt the University of Chicago,\u201d Sanders says as the photo fades in and out, \u201cI got involved in the civil rights movement. We ended up engaging in a sit-in demonstration.\u201d It\u2019s on the campaign\u2019s Tumblr feed. \u201cAs the Civil Rights Movement grew, Bernie led a sit-in to desegregate off-campus housing at the University of Chicago,\u201d reads the timeline under 1962. And Sanders used it in a stirring 2013 video to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington. \u201cI remember the day very well and I remember the moment, the period well,\u201d he says as the photo passes by, \u201cbecause up at the University of Chicago, where I was then going to school, we were working with young people in the South.\u201d", "Prominent civil rights leader Rep. John Lewis (who suffered\u00a0injuries\u00a0during the Selma march) also cast doubt on the attribution when he offered comment\u00a0on the civil rights movement and averred that he never saw or met Sanders during the course of his own activism:", "Democratic Rep. John Lewis questioned the extent of Bernie Sanders' participation in the civil rights movement after an event where the Congressional Black Caucus political action committee endorsed Hillary Clinton. Sanders has frequently talked up his history as an activist while he was at the University of Chicago in the 1960s and touted his work with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. But Lewis, a civil rights icon and leader of SNCC said he never saw Sanders at any events. \"I never saw him. I never met him,\" Lewis said. \"I was chair of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee for three years, from 1963 to 1966. I was involved with the sit-ins, the Freedom Rides, the March on Washington, the march from Selma to Montgomery and directed (the) voter education project for six years. But I met Hillary Clinton. I met President (Bill) Clinton.\"", "Supporters of Sanders were quick to respond with other photographic examples of the candidate engaged in activism during the civil rights era.\u00a0One was an image of a young Sanders chained to a black woman during housing protests, and another depicted him vigorously resisting arrest:", ".@Salon I wonder if Bernie Sanders saw John Lewis at the Chicago housing protest. #artfulsmear for #HillaryClinton pic.twitter.com/GuegNBFSVd \u2014 berniehun (@JenD1974) February 29, 2016", "New photo from the archives shows Bernie Sanders chained to other civil rights protesters #FeelTheBern pic.twitter.com/9IzFgkpGyn \u2014 \u0279o\u0287\u0250u\u01dd\u028cou (@novenator) March 1, 2016", "Capehart published a follow-up blog post, that\u00a0included objections raised by\u00a0photographer Danny Lyon (who snapped the disputed picture) but stopped short of retracting his original claim.

These newly discovered pictures, including close up photographs of the student activists show us exactly what Bernie was and what he remains.", "By\u00a0contrast, photographs shared by TIME magazine showed clearly marked differences between Rappaport and Sanders:", "Photographer Danny Lyon said\u00a0he was well acquainted with the individuals\u00a0depicted in his photographs:", "I took the photograph of Bernie Sanders speaking to his fellow CORE members at that sit-in.
