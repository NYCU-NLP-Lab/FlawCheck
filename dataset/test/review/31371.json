The graph is decorated with images of a frowning Obama over the bars representing 2010-16, and a smiling Trump for 2017 and 2018.

Over the course of his investigation, View found that the data comes from now-banned subreddits, 8Chan threads, and Google spreadsheets, where QAnon followers compiled news articles and press releases about human trafficking and tallied arrests. \"Their entire methodology for counting human trafficking arrests was fatally flawed,\" View told PolitiFact in an interview. \"They didn\u2019t discriminate between ICE and other law enforcement agencies. They didn\u2019t make distinctions between charges and arrests. They didn\u2019t count arrests that weren\u2019t reported in the news.\"", "QAnon followers promote or believe an unsubstantiated narrative that Trump and the military are working together to take down a powerful sex trafficking ring, which counts the Obamas and the Clintons among its members. Followers of the conspiracy theory, therefore, have a vested interest in proving that human trafficking arrests have increased under Trump.", "According to official numbers, this isn\u2019t the case. An ICE spokesperson shared with us the official arrest figures for the years 2017 and 2018, and they show that yearly human trafficking arrests have actually decreased since the final years of the Obama presidency.
