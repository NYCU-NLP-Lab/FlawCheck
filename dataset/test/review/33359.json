It\u00a0has been viewed more than 120,000 times since.", "The three-minute 22-second video shows a man, who identifies himself as Anacleto Belleza Millendez, addressing the camera.", "The video\u2019s Tagalog-language title describes Millendez as a \u201cdoctor of the nation\u201d and states: \"Clean Semen is a Cure for COVID-19\u201d.", "From the video\u2019s one-minute-27-second mark, Millendez says in Tagalog: \u201cThere is a scientific study that \u2018tamod\u2019 or what we call semen contains spermine, one great ingredient, one amino acid that can destroy, can kill microbes, especially microbes caused by viruses.\u201d", "Later, at the video's two-minute-25-second mark, he says: \u201cIt\u2019s really simple to eliminate this dreadful coronavirus. Clean semen, from males. It can be used as a hand sanitiser. It can be ingested. Just make sure it is clean.\u201d", "The video has also been shared alongside a similar claim\u00a0here, here and here on Facebook, and here\u00a0and here on Twitter.", "The claim\u00a0is\u00a0false.", "A keyword search on Google found parts of the caption of the YouTube video were copied from the summary section of this 2016 scientific study about chikungunya and Zika viruses.", "The claims are \u201cridiculous,\u201d Dr. Marco Vignuzzi, one of the authors of the study, told AFP in an email dated May 13, 2020. \u201cOur work has nothing to do with semen, nor with COVID.\u201d", "\u201cOur work shows that viruses use polyamines (such as spermine and spermidine) to infect cells,\u201d Vignuzzi added. \u201cDespite carrying the root word \u2018sperm\u2019, these molecules are found in every cell in our bodies and have nothing specifically to do with semen.\u201d", "Another author of the study, Dr. Bryan Mounce, added: \u201cOur work shows the opposite of these claims.\u201d He further explained in an email to AFP on May 13 that the study has shown polyamines, which are small molecules found in human cells and present in semen, in fact \u201csupport virus infection\u201d.", "The authors\u2019 comments were reflected in the summary of the 2016 research paper, which states in part: \u201cWe find that polyamines are required for the life cycle of the RNA viruses chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and Zika virus (ZIKV)... SAT1 and, more broadly, polyamine depletion restrict viral replication and suggest promising avenues for antiviral therapies.\u201d", "In response to an enquiry\u00a0from AFP on May 14, 2020 about\u00a0his video, Millendez declined to comment.", "He instead provided instructions to\u00a0visit a Facebook page which\u00a0also touted\u00a0the purported anti-COVID-19 properties of semen.", "To date, no medicine has been shown to prevent or cure COVID-19, according to this fact sheet by the World Health Organization (WHO).", "WHO figures show there have been more than 287,000 confirmed COVID-19 deaths and over four million infections worldwide as of May 14, 2020.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
