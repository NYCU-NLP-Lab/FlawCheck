["Little Rhody got a national shout out on ABC\u2019s talk show \"The View\" on Sept. 27, 2012. \u00a0That\u2019s \u00a0when subtle-as-napalm conservative pundit Ann Coulter used Rhode Island\u2019s 2011 voter-identification law to rebut the charge that such legislation is a Republican scheme to steal elections by making it harder for poor and minority voters to vote.\n\n\"One of the first states in the union to pass a voter ID bill was Rhode Island, 85 percent Democratic legislature,\" she told cohost Joy Behar, after Behar suggested that Republicans were pushing voter identification not to stop fraud but to reduce Democratic turnout.\n\n\"And who pushed it?,\" Coulter asked. \"A black Democrat in the House, a black Democrat in the Senate. That's a fact!\"\n\nDemocrats in individual states, and nationally, have sought to discredit voter-identification initiatives, \u00a0charging they are part of a Republican strategy to make it harder for people who have historically favored Democrats to get the paperwork they need.\n\nAs Coulter\u2019s counterpunch showed, Rhode Island\u2019s voter identification law, passed last year, \u00a0has emerged as a Republican talking point to dispute accusations of partisanship.\n\nIn this item, we will check Coulter\u2019s claim that Rhode Island was a leader in voter-identification legislation. We will examine the second part of her statement in a separate item.\n\nRhode Island, \u00a0where 83.5 percent of the state\u2019s legislators are Democrats, is an exception to the national trend on voter-identification, but, despite what Coulter claimed, it is far from being \"one of the first\" states to pass such legislation.\n\nAccording to the National Conference of State Legislatures, as of Sept. 5, \u00a02012, \u00a031 states had enacted some form of voter identification law. At least 12 did so between 2003-2010, well before Governor Lincoln Chafee signed Rhode Island\u2019s law in July 2011.\n\nWhich state actually was the first is unclear. For the modern era, it appears the first state to require voters to verify their identity appears to be South Carolina, in 1950, said Jennie Bower, a senior fellow who researches the issue for the council. Rhode Island isn\u2019t even the first state in New England to require identification; Connecticut did it in 1993.\n\nOur ruling\n\nAnn Coulter said Rhode Island was one of the first states to enact voter-identification laws. It isn\u2019t. \u00a0At least a dozen states had such laws earlier, making Rhode Island closer to the middle of the pack.\n\nWe rule her statement False.", "The View,\"Ann Coulter causes mass hysteria on \u2018The View,\u2019 Whoopi bleeped...\" Sept. 27, 2012, accessed Oct. 2, 2012\n\nNational Conference of State Legislatures, \"Voter Identification Requirements,\" accessed Oct. 2, 2012\n\nInterview: Jennie Bower, senior fellow, National Council of State Legislatures, Oct. 1, 2012.\n\nRhode Island General Laws, \"Conduct of Election and Voting Equipment, and Supplies,\" \u00a017-19-24.2\n\nThe Providence Journal, \"Voter-ID measure had broad backing; Bills similar to the one signed by Governor Chafee opposed by minorities, Democrats elsewhere,\" July 7, 2011", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
