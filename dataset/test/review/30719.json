Instead, Sanders' proposal includes creating \"clean, domestic alternatives\" to fossil fuels and improving the nation's rail system:", "Build electric vehicle charging stations. In a country where nearly 30 percent of carbon pollution emissions come from the transportation sector, it is imperative that we end our dependence on gasoline. Vehicles that run on electricity are more efficient than internal combustion engines and can be powered with renewable energy resources like wind and solar. We need to support the development of vehicle charging stations that will allow us to drive cleanly and sustainably.", "Build high-speed passenger and cargo rail. Our nation\u2019s rail system is largely obsolete, even though our energy-efficient railroads move more freight than ever, and Amtrak\u2019s ridership has never been higher. While Amtrak\u2019s fastest train travels at an average speed of just 65 mph, high-speed rail now crisscrosses most of Europe, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea and China with trains that run up to 200 mph. Once we have a state-of-the-art rail system, we will not only be able to move passengers and cargo faster and more efficiently, we will make significant cuts in carbon pollution emissions that cause climate change and create millions of permanent family-wage jobs for electricians, pipe fitters and sheet-metal workers.", "While it's true that Bernie Sanders has proposed to\u00a0create a state-of-the-art rail system that would potentially take many trucks off the roads, the Democratic candidate has not proposed\u00a0an all-out ban on trucks in the United States.", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
