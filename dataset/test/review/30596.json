Votes cannot be cast after the Polls are closed!\u201d", "Trump had a significant lead in Pennsylvania and tighter advantages in Michigan and Wisconsin as the polling day of November 3 drew to a close, according to US television networks.", "But Twitter flagged the post, saying the information it discussed was disputed given the incomplete results. Trump\u2019s opponent Joe Biden had earlier said he was confident of overturning the president\u2019s advantage in the Midwest states.", "AFP fact checks key quotes from Trump\u2019s remarks.", "\u201cI want to thank the American people for their tremendous support, millions and millions of people voted for us tonight. And a very sad group of people is trying to disenfranchise that group of people and we won\u2019t stand for it.\u201d", "State officials are tallying votes that were legitimately cast for both candidates before polls closed. Millions of ballots were sent by mail or deposited at official drop boxes. There is no evidence -- nor did Trump offer any -- that people who voted for the president are being disenfranchised.", "\u201cWe have won Georgia. We\u2019re up by 2.5 percent or 117,000 votes with only seven percent left. They\u2019re never going to catch us. They can\u2019t catch us.\u201d", "The vote count in Georgia was incomplete, with tallies in several Democrat-leaning urban centers around the state capital Atlanta yet to come, when the president spoke. At 2300 GMT on Wednesday, no television network had called Georgia for either Trump or Biden, and the gap had narrowed to 1.7 percent with a total of seven percent of votes still to be counted.", "\u201cWe\u2019re up 690,000 votes in Pennsylvania. These aren\u2019t even close\u2026 with 64 percent of the vote in, it\u2019s going to be almost impossible to catch.\u201d", "Trump was leading strongly in Pennsylvania and his advantage leaves Biden facing a hard climb to take the state. However, uncounted ballots on Wednesday remained in seven figures well into Wednesday and those votes were cast in traditionally Democratic-heavy areas.", "\u201cThis is a fraud on the American public. This is an embarrassment to our country. We were getting ready to win this election. Frankly, we did win this election.\u201d", "No television network or the Associated Press, the main US news agency that compiles vote returns, has declared an overall winner, saying the Trump-Biden contest is too close to call. Therefore, Trump\u2019s declaration of victory was premature.", "Trump, without evidence, has for months criticised mail-in ballots, saying it will lead to fraud and a rigged election. AFP fact-checked several such claims here.", "Americans relied on postal voting -- which is expected to favor Biden -- in unprecedented numbers in 2020 because of the coronavirus pandemic. Many votes that remain to be counted were cast early, which could eliminate Trump\u2019s advantage built up by high in-person voting on November 3.", "After his speech, Trump reiterated his claims on Twitter, writing: \u201cLast night I was leading, often solidly, in many key States, in almost all instances Democrat run & controlled. Then, one by one, they started to magically disappear as surprise ballot dumps were counted. VERY STRANGE, and the \u2018pollsters\u2019 got it completely & historically wrong!\u201d", "\u201cWe\u2019ll be going to the US Supreme Court. We want all voting to stop. We don\u2019t want them to find any ballots at four o\u2019clock in the morning and add them to the list. We will win this and as far as I am concerned we already have won it,\u201d Trump said in the White House speech.", "After it became clear that Biden had overtaken Trump in Wisconsin, the president's team announced plans to seek a recount. The Trump\u00a0 campaign also said it was taking action to stop\u00a0votes being counted\u00a0in Pennsylvania.", "US networks later called\u00a0Wisconsin and Michigan for Biden but Pennsylvania remains undeclared.", "Any legal challenge by Trump\u2019s Republican Party would have to be pursued in individual states or at a federal level before it could reach the Supreme Court.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
