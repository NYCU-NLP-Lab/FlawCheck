Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez as saying that \"Donald Trump is to blame for the deaths of thousands of Americans\" and asserting that Ocasio-Cortez had committed a felony by making \"a false accusation against the President or his staff during a national emergency\" (per 22 USC Section 108.9):", "As the tiny information box at the bottom of the meme indicates, however, Ocasio-Cortez said no such thing, and the cited law about making false accusations is non-existent.  (U.S. Code Title 22 deals with Foreign Relations and has no Section 108.)", "The \"About\" section of the \"America's Last Line of Defense\" Facebook page states that \"Nothing on this page is real. It is a collection of the satirical whimsies of liberal trolls masquerading as conservatives.\"", "For background, here is why we sometimes write about satire/humor.", "David Mikkelson founded the site now known as snopes.com back in 1994.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
