Doctors confirmed the men have anal cancer.", "The baboon, which has been nicknamed Somizi travels alone and this, according to animal behaviour specialist is a strange occurrence because baboons are known to ravel in troops. One specialist, Lizzie McKenzie said \u201cthe baboon might be an outcast and chased away from it\u2019s troop. That is why it is travelling alone but as to the reason it\u2019s attacking only males, it beats me.

I can earn a few hundred dollars a month from my news site, it performs so badly. But stuff about gay baboons, stuff about pastors saying they went to heaven, that goes viral,\u201d he says.", "It is still unclear whether this fake news story was ever picked up by a genuine newspaper. \u00a0The text at the bottom of the story states that it was \"printed by Hassan Mohiuddin at City Press, Talpur Road, Kara(...)\" which appears to refer to a newspaper located on Talpur Road in Karachi, Pakistan. However, we could not locate a publisher or publication called \"City Press\" in Pakistan or an editor named Hassan Mohiuddin.", "Finally, we feel it is our responsibility to clear the pictured baboon's name.
