Gov. Dan Patrick, seeking re-election,\u00a0entered 2018 by warning on his campaign\u2019s Facebook page that \"criminal aliens\" committed more than 500,000 Texas crimes in recent years.", "We wondered about Patrick\u2019s declaration in part because we\u2019d just found scant data about Texas crimes committed by individuals living illegally in the United States. Also, research rooted in U.S. Census Bureau data suggests that nationally, unauthorized immigrants commit few crimes.", "For that other fact-check, we calculated from annual state-posted crime reports that the 170,000 arrests of \"criminal immigrants\" proclaimed by a Texas House member at a 2015 hearing represented about 4 percent of all the adult arrests in the state from 2011 through 2015. But absent expert analysis, we wouldn't brandish that percentage as a fact.", "Here\u2019s Patrick\u2019s statement on Facebook, which he presented against the backdrop of a wire fence: \"566,000 crimes made in Texas by criminal aliens in the last 6 years.\"", "We took that to mean that \"criminal aliens\" were found guilty of 566,000 crimes over six years. Then again, text in smaller print to the right of Patrick\u2019s fence-backdropped statement offers a different interpretation. That text says: \"In the past six years, criminal aliens have been charged with more than 566,000 crimes in Texas including kidnapping, homicide, burglary, and much more. There is no excuse for endangering our communities by allowing criminal aliens who have committed a crime to go free.\"", "Some perspective: We estimate, starting from Texas Department of Public Safety annual crime reports for 2011 through 2016, that there were 5,513,663 adult criminal arrests in the state in the six-plus years referenced by Patrick. If the 566,000 figure offered by Patrick solely reflects arrests, he was referring to about 10 percent of adult arrests in the state.", "Patrick points to state-posted figures", "We asked Patrick, a Houston Republican who touts his support for a secure U.S.-Mexico border in a fresh video ad, about the basis of his 566,000 \"crimes made\" statement.", "A spokesman, Alejandro Garcia, replied by email: \"We have answered this question many times.\"", "Garcia provided a link to a familiar DPS web page, \"Historical Arrest and Conviction Data for Select Offenses Associated with Criminal Aliens:\"", "SOURCE: Web page, \"Historical Arrest and Conviction Data for Select Offenses Associated with Criminal Aliens,\" Texas Department of Public Safety, undated (accessed Jan. 23, 2018)", "Adding up the chart\u2019s tallied arrests, covering 11 crime categories, gets you to 638,411 arrests \"associated with criminal aliens.\"", "And did all those arrests occur in the six-plus years noted by Patrick on Facebook?", "Not so.", "A related DPS web page noted by Garcia, \"Texas Criminal Alien Arrest Data,\" says that according to Department of Homeland Security \"status indicators, over 240,000 criminal aliens have been booked into local Texas jails between June 1, 2011 and December 31, 2017.
