["\u201cCurrent Actual Election Result Update: President Trump Leading In Electoral College With More Paths to Victory Than Biden,\u201d says the headline of the November 10, 2020 article in Gateway Pundit, which NewsGuard called a \u201csuper-spreader\u201d of election misinformation.", "A map and Electoral College count included with the article give Trump 232 electoral votes against Biden\u2019s 226, with 80 still listed as a toss-up. In reality, at the time of the article\u2019s publication Biden had at least 279 electoral votes compared with Trump\u2019s 217.", "By excluding the 46 Electoral College votes of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin -- all of which were called days ago for Biden --\u00a0 the article is able to falsely put Trump ahead.", "The claim was also posted on Instagram here, Facebook here\u00a0and on Twitter including here.", "\u201cBased on actual results and accounting for states currently not called, still counting, recounting, under investigation or audit, or states with election issues now in the courts, President Trump is winning the 2020 Presidential Election,\u201d it says.", "But a November 12 statement from federal and state election officials, including from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and the National Association of Secretaries of State, said, \u201cThe November 3rd election was the most secure in American history.\u201d", "Despite \u201cmany unfounded claims and opportunities for misinformation about the process of our elections,\u201d they found \u201cno evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised.\u201d", "AFP breaks down the claims made by Gateway Pundit state by state:", "\u201cPresident Trump was up by 700,000 votes on election night but more than a million ballots were added since that which eventually stole the election for Biden,\u201d it says.", "This echoes claims by Trump and his lawyer Rudy Giuliani, who tweeted on November 4 that Trump had a lead of 700,000 votes and it was \u201ccheating\u201d to claim the race was still too close to call.", "Trump was initially ahead in Pennsylvania but data accessed later on November 4 by AFP Fact Check showed that more than one million mail-in ballots still needed to be tallied. As the counting continued, livestreamed by 11 cameras and watched by Republican and Democratic observers, Biden did overtake Trump two days later.", "US media then projected a win for the Democrat in Pennsylvania, giving Biden 279 Electoral College votes against 214 for Trump. The president falsely claimed he won, has refused to concede, and insists the election was rigged even as Biden presses ahead with the transition.", "Government officials and monitors in Pennsylvania have repeatedly stressed the integrity of the state\u2019s election process.", "\u201cEarly in the morning after the election more than 100,000 votes magically appeared in Milwaukee,\u201d Gateway Pundit said, repeating a claim it made on November 4.", "That earlier article is based on a graph from analysts at FiveThirtyEight, which showed a sudden surge in votes for Biden between midnight and 6:00 am on November 4.", "As FiveThirtyEight reporter Maggie Koerth pointed out, the sharp increase in votes was due to Milwaukee absentee ballot results announced at 3:56 am on November 4. Most of those more than 460,000 votes went to Biden.", "\u201cThere\u2019s nothing \u2018magical\u2019 about these vote drops: counties simply released a large batch of results all at once,\u201d Curt Villarosa, a publicity manager for ABC News, which owns FiveThirtyEight, told AFP in an email.", "\u201cThere were over 100,000 votes dumped in Detroit and the lead here was stolen from Trump as well. Once the illegal votes are eliminated President Trump has a very good chance of winning this state as well,\u201d Gateway Pundit claims.", "\u201cThe \u2018dumped\u2019 rumor likely started from a graphic that got circulated the day after the election claiming 138K votes for Biden \u2018magically\u2019 appeared overnight,\u201d Tracy Wimmer, director of media relations for Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, told AFP by email.", "\u201cThe information contained in the graphic is entirely false.\u201d", "On November 4 reports spread online that the number of Biden votes spiked by more than 130,000 as ballots continued to be counted. But the apparent jump was caused by human error when a zero was accidentally added during the tallying.", "Caroline Wilson, clerk of Shiawassee county in central Michigan, told AFP by phone, \u201cI added an extra zero accidentally,\u201d thereby reporting 153,710 votes for Biden instead of 15,371.", "\u201cThe minute it was discovered, it was corrected, probably within 20 minutes,\u201d she said.", "When Biden\u2019s 153,710 votes were lowered to 15,371 votes in a correction, 138,339 votes were removed from the Democrat\u2019s total tally without any changes to Trump\u2019s numbers.", "Trump\u2019s campaign on November 10 sued Benson and Wayne County seeking to halt certification of the state\u2019s election results over irregularities including the counting of \u201cillegal and ineligible\u201d ballots. The suit makes no mention of votes being \u201cdumped,\u201d nor does it claim a definitive figure of 100,000 or otherwise. It alleges a few examples that involve dozens of ballots.", "The tally in Detroit, which is part of Wayne County, was \u201ctransparent and accurate,\u201d Benson\u2019s office said. The Secretary has also called the lawsuit \u201ca PR strategy, a political strategy, more than a legal strategy.\u201d", "\u201cThe President was winning this state on election night by 100,000 votes. But after the election a program was put in place to basically harvest a number of ballots,\u201d Gateway Pundit claims.", "Ballot harvesting is the collection of ballots by third parties, which occurs before the count but raises concerns about election integrity. In Georgia ballot harvesting is illegal unless it is done by relatives, a caregiver, or people in the same household.", "Georgia\u2019s Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, when asked whether he had seen evidence of widespread election fraud in the state, said: \u201cWe have ongoing investigations but we\u2019ve not seen something widespread.\u201d", "On November 11, Raffensperger said the state would recount the presidential race due to the slim difference in votes between Trump and Biden, who is leading in the state which has 16 electoral votes.", "\u201cWe believe that the ballots were counted accurately with the machine count,\u201d he said, expecting the recount to confirm the existing outcome. \u201cI\u2019m a Republican\u2026 but the results will be the results.\u201d", "\u201cThere is much fraud here as well. Signatures were not verified on hundreds of thousands of votes. It is likely that President Trump will win this state if any of the ineligible votes are eliminated here,\u201d Gateway Pundit claims.", "There is no evidence for the signature verification claim.", "Experts say safeguards including signature verification, which is done manually in some counties, are proven to work. The biggest threat may not be overcounting but the opposite, because ballots can be rejected if voters\u2019 signatures change.", "Two Nevada Republican candidates for Congress filed a lawsuit in which one woman, Jill Stokke, claimed a mail-in ballot she had not signed was counted in the election. As a result, she sought to halt use of signature verification machines throughout Clark County, which includes Las Vegas.", "On November 6, District Judge Andrew Gordon rejected the Republican request, saying there was insufficient evidence.", "Unofficial results viewed early on November 13 from Nevada, which has six Electoral College votes, showed Biden winning with 671,995 votes compared with Trump\u2019s 635,089.", "Contacted by AFP about the Gateway Pundit claim, the Nevada Secretary of State\u2019s office referred to this statement which said \u201call creditable allegations of fraud\u201d are being investigated.", "\u201cDue to the delays in counting and recording a winner, it is likely this state is being stolen from President Trump as well. What a mess,\u201d Gateway Pundit said.", "At the time that article was written only some US media had called Arizona and its 11 electoral votes for Biden, but that changed late on November 12 when remaining TV networks also declared him the winner, turning the state Democrat blue for the first time since 1996.", "Biden was\u00a0ahead by more than 11,000 votes according to the state\u2019s unofficial tally, with a few hundred final votes to be counted and reported November 13 in the largest county, Maricopa.", "Secretary of State Katie Hobbs has said there is \u201czero credible evidence of any impropriety or widespread irregularities\u201d in the state.", "Distinguished Professor Kathleen Dolan, a political scientist at the University of Wisconsin Milwaukee, told AFP by phone that the Gateway Pundit claim is \u201cridiculous\u201d and \u201cignoring reality\u201d after a smooth election which left Biden ahead.", "\u201cThere\u2019s no evidence of malfeasance, there's no evidence of vote fraud, there\u2019s no evidence of things not being done correctly,\u201d\u00a0she said. \u201cAll of the different suits that the president and his campaign have filed so far have been shot down because there\u2019s no merit to any of them.\u201d", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
