["In a familiar high-pitched hyperbolic monologue, another episode of Arnab Goswami\u2019s Daily Newshour \u2018The Debate\u2019 wrapped up on August 22. The topic chosen for the hour-long debate was \u2013 \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with chanting Bharat Mata Ki Jai?\u201d in the wake of former J&K CM Farooq Abdullah being heckled by a crowd in Srinagar two days after he chanted the slogan in Delhi. The show started with Goswami urging everybody to shout \u2018Bharat Mata Ki Jai\u2019 and ended with a lecture on the Indian Constitution by BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra. In between, there were comical moments like Abdullah accidentally referring to Goswami as \u2018pagal\u2019 and hastily correcting his faux pas. However, the gaffes were not limited to Abdullah and this article is about the ones that Goswami made during the length of the show. These were originally pointed out by Shuddhabrata Sengupta, an artist, curator and writer with the Raqs Media Collective.", "While exposing so-called \u201cpseudo-nationalists\u201d, Arnab Goswami said that these are the people who have floated the false rhetoric of \u2018Bharat Mata Ki Jai\u2019 being an \u201cRSS conspiracy\u201d. Posing a question at Prof Visweswara Rao he asks, \u201cWas Mohanchand Karamchand Gandhi a member of the RSS?\u201d He can be heard making the statement from 35:03 to 35:11.", "Goswami\u2019s intention was to portray Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s nationalism by citing that he had inaugurated the Bharat Mata temple in Varanasi in 1936. However, while doing so, he mispronounced the name of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi.", "\u201cWe don\u2019t have to shout \u2018Bharat Mata Ki Jai\u2019 to prove our patriotism,\u201d said Prof Rao 40 minutes into the debate. Interjecting, as always, Goswami accused him of \u201cappropriating Ambedkar\u201d.", "\u201cYou, who dismissed \u2018Bharat Mata Ki Jai\u2019 as jingoistic, what will you say to Dr B.R. Ambedkar, who you tried to appropriate at every leg and opportunity, when he wrote and I quote \u2013 The slogan Bharat Mata Ki Jai electrified the whole nation whereas if one were to raise the slogan as India Mata ki Jai, it would look fanciful and uninspiring,\u201d shouted Goswami (from 40:00 to 40:24), concluding that Ambedkar supported the \u2018Bharat Mata Ki Jai\u2019 slogan.", "As it turns out, the quote was actually not made by Dr B.R. Amdebakar. A basic Google search reveals that the lines Goswami attributed to Ambedkar are a part of a book written by Dr Raj Kumar, titled \u201cAmbedkar and His Writings: A Look for the New Generation\u201d and published in 2008.", "The book, which is the author\u2019s study of Ambedkar\u2019s work for the Depressed Classes, mentions the lines in the context of India being referred to as \u201cBharatvarsha\u201d. He writes that \u201cthe name India was given to the country by foreigners\u201d and that \u201ca proper noun is never translated\u201d. The difference between \u201cIndia\u201d and \u201cBharatvarsha\u201d, Dr Kumar writes, is visible when the two are interchanged in the slogan. Therefore, it is clear that the statement was never made by Ambedkar but was the author\u2019s opinion.", "While calling Mahatma Gandhi \u201cMohanchand\u201d Karamchand Gandhi might have been a slip, it is ironical that Goswami was browbeating his panelists on nationalism and history and ended up attributing a factually incorrect quote to Ambedkar.", "Donate Now", "Pooja Chaudhuri is a senior editor at Alt News.", "Entering its fifth day on October 11, the Israel-Palestine conflict all but escalated into a\u2026", "On September 29, two youths named Iqbal and Rahul were involved in a bike collision\u2026", "Amid the ongoing Israel-Palestine conflict, media outlet Times Now put out a report claiming that\u2026", "A 45-second video clip is being shared widely on social media where a group of\u2026", "All India Majlis-E-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) chief Asaduddin Owaisi addressed a rally at Dumri in Giridih,\u2026"]
