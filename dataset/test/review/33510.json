["By Katherine Hartzell", "Posted on June 5, 2020", "A viral meme falsely suggests Dr. Anthony Fauci supports administering a COVID-19 vaccine before clinical trials are completed. Fauci supports the manufacture of vaccines while trials are underway \u2014 but only administering the vaccine once the trials are over and it is deemed effective and safe.", "Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has become a leading figure in addressing treatments and a vaccine for COVID-19 as a member of the White House Coronavirus Task Force.", "But a meme circulating on Facebook, attributing two quotes to Fauci, falsely suggests an inconsistency in his views on the need for clinical trials before approving a COVID-19 treatment and the process needed to ensure the safety of an eventual vaccine.", "The first quote in the meme reads, \u201cJust because hundreds of doctors are reporting hydroxychloroquine is curing some COVID-19 patients, it is not valid until we have a major study done.\u201d Fauci has said that controlled clinical trials are required to make sure hydroxychloroquine is \u201ctruly safe and truly effective\u201d against COVID-19, and the evidence so far does not show that it is.", "The second quote reads, \u201cAs soon as a COVID-19 vaccine is manufactured, it must be delivered to healthcare professionals for immediate human injection. Proper studies can be done later.\u201d That\u2019s false. Fauci has said distribution and administration of a vaccine would only occur if the clinical trial shows that \u201cin fact it is effective\u201d and safe.", "It is true that Fauci has cautioned against the use of hydroxychloroquine before its effectiveness is proven by a large clinical trial. In March, he explained that the evidence supporting hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19 is largely \u201canecdotal\u201d and that without first undergoing a controlled clinical trial \u2014 in which a treatment group is compared with a control group \u2014 the effectiveness of the drug cannot be known.", "Large trials are still pending, but the evidence so far does not suggest that hydroxychloroquine is effective against COVID-19.", "One study, a randomized controlled trial of 150 patients hospitalized with mild to moderate disease in China, did not\u00a0find the drug helped reduce the chance that patients would test positive for the virus within 28 days \u2014 and patients receiving hydroxychloroquine reported more side effects, although most were minor.", "In a May 27 interview with CNN, Fauci said, \u201cThe scientific data is really quite evident now about the lack of efficacy\u201d of hydroxychloroquine in treating COVID-19, and he noted the likelihood of \u201cadverse events with regard to cardiovascular.\u201d", "Regarding a COVID-19 vaccine, Fauci did not say that the vaccine will be administered before \u201cproper studies\u201d are over, as the meme claims.", "As we\u2019ve written before, Fauci outlined the steps that the COVID-19 vaccine must go through at a February 25 press conference.", "Fauci, Feb. 25: Now the thing we need to understand, because we want to make sure that people don\u2019t get confused, that getting a vaccine into a Phase 1 trial within a three-month period, you need at least three to four months to determine if it\u2019s safe and whether it induces the kind of response that you would predict will be protective. Once you do that you graduate to a much larger trial. \u2026 When you go to a Phase 2 trial, you\u2019re talking about hundreds if not thousands of individuals to determine efficacy. That is a trial that we would have to conduct in those countries, in those areas, where there\u2019s active transmission. That itself, even at rocket speed, would take at least an additional six to eight months. So when you are talking about the availability of a vaccine even to scale it up you\u2019re talking about a year to a year-and-a-half.", "That timeline was revised on May 15, when the Trump administration announced \u201cOperation Warp Speed\u201d \u2014 a national program \u201cto accelerate the development, manufacturing, and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics.\u201d The goal is \u201cto have substantial quantities of a safe and effective vaccine available for Americans by January 2021,\u201d the Department of Health and Human Services said.", "In a June 1 interview with STAT News, Fauci explained how the administration would move more quickly to make a vaccine available to the public without compromising public health.", "Fauci said manufacture of a COVID-19 vaccine would begin \u201ceven before you know it works,\u201d which may be the origin of the second quote in the meme. That would allow the vaccine to be widely distributed more quickly, but only \u201cif in fact it is effective,\u201d Fauci said.", "\u201cAt the same time you\u2019re finishing your Phase 1 trial, you\u2019re preparing your Phase 3 trial sites, which is very expensive, and then you\u2019re starting to manufacture the vaccine even before you know it works. All of that cuts months off,\u201d said Fauci. However, Fauci elaborated, \u201cWe\u2019ve designed the Phase 3 trial to very carefully look at safety, even more so than is done in a regular trial.\u201d", "He described the accelerated timeline as \u201caspirational,\u201d and cautioned that there is \u201cno guarantee\u201d that the vaccine will be proven effective.", "Fauci, June 1: If \u2026 you\u2019re already manufacturing doses, by December and January, if you\u2019re lucky and if in fact it is effective, you can have a significant number of doses available by the end of the year, the beginning of 2021. So I think it\u2019s aspirational, but it\u2019s certainly doable.", "The only thing that\u2019s the big unknown to me is that, is it going to be effective? I think we could do it within the time frame that I\u2019ve outlined. But there\u2019s no guarantee that it\u2019s going to be effective.", "Many vaccines are currently undergoing clinical trials. One vaccine that shows promise, developed by Moderna in partnership with NIAID, is scheduled in July to enter Phase 3 \u2014 the phase in which a vaccine is given to thousands of people to test for safety. Another vaccine, developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca, recently began recruiting participants for Phases 2 and 3 of the clinical trial.", "In a\u00a0live\u00a0Q&A with the\u00a0Journal of the American Medical Association on June 3, Fauci said the plan to manufacture millions of doses of vaccine still undergoing clinical trial is \u201cvery unique in vaccine development\u201d and is an investment risk for the companies and the federal government.", "Fauci said the plan is to manufacture \u201cclose to 100 million doses\u201d by the time clinical trials indicate whether the vaccine is effective, and that \u201cby the beginning of 2021, we hope to have a couple hundred million of doses.\u201d", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media. Our previous stories can be found\u00a0here.", "American Conservative Voice. Facebook page. 20 May 2020.", "Christensen, Jen. \u201cUS should have a \u2018couple hundred million\u2019 doses of a Covid-19 vaccine by the start of 2021, Fauci says.\u201d CNN. 3 Jun 2020.", "Cole, Devan. \u201cFauci: Science shows hydroxychloroquine is not effective as a coronavirus treatment.\u201d CNN.com. 27 May 2020.", "COVID-19 Update: Press Briefing on the U.S. Response | February 25, 2020.
