It was also shared here on Facebook in Turkish with a similar claim.", "The videos have the watermark and the account name of TikTok user\u00a0@kelvinklayn. The same video has been viewed tens of thousands of times in\u00a0this\u00a0post on social media video app TikTok after it was uploaded by user\u00a0@kelvinklayn without a caption.", "Comments on the video suggested some TikTok users believed it showed a real-life incident. Below is a screenshot of the some of the comments:", "The claim is false; the video has been created using a flight simulation programme.", "A Lufthansa spokesperson told AFP by email on October 25, 2019, that the video was \u201cNOT a real life scenario.\u201d", "An analysis of keyframes extracted from the clip using video verification tool InVID found it consists of computer-generated imagery.", "Sinking engines", "This still from the video shows parts of the Lufthansa flight\u2019s engines sinking into the ground upon contact, leaving no visible damage to the runway.
