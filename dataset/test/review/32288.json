["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "Ever since Atlanta Public Schools\u2019 cheating scandal began, then-Superintendent Beverly Hall has repeatedly pointed to a national test as proof that the changes she made produced real results: the National Assessment of Educational Progress.\n\nThe NAEP is a top measure of student achievement, and APS\u2019 NAEP scores improved under Hall\u2019s term, Hall has said. One of her backers mentioned these scores in a New York Times article last month. Hall, herself, raised them Aug. 10 in a commentary published by the national trade publication Education Week. \u00a0\n\n\"The results of the standardized tests administered in 2010 and 2011 under this enhanced security have not been questioned -- and most important of all the dramatic improvement in test scores has remained. That improvement has also been confirmed by the National Assessment of Educational Progress, or NAEP, which is independently administered,\" Hall wrote.\n\n\"Dramatic\" improvement in scores on the Criterion-Referenced Competency Tests has been \"confirmed\" by the NAEP? \u00a0We decided to take a look.\n\nFirst, a brief aside. We checked Hall\u2019s claim that CRCT tests scores for 2010 and 2011 \"have not been questioned\" and gave her a Pants on Fire. State investigators, the Governor\u2019s Office for Student Achievement and The Atlanta Journal-Constitution questioned the validity of both years\u2019 results. \u00a0\n\nWe asked Hall\u2019s attorney for evidence backing her claim about the national test but received no response. After our inquiry, Council of Great City Schools Executive Director\nMichael Casserly repeated a similar claim Sept. 7 in The New York Times, but the story included no supporting evidence. Hall previously served on the board of Casserly\u2019s organization.\n\nNow, the NAEP is different from your typical standardized test. Like the CRCT, it tests core subjects such as reading and mathematics, but many students don\u2019t take it. Those who do don\u2019t take all of it. They don\u2019t even get their results. \u00a0\n\nInstead, the NAEP randomly selects a representative sample of students to take the test. \u00a0They take slices of the exam over a single day. \u00a0\n\nHistorically, the NAEP has been used to track student achievement at the state and national level. During the past decade, however, about a dozen large urban districts were recruited for a special trial to see how well the test evaluates district performance. APS joined the trial in 2002.\n\nThe test was not the focus of the state\u2019s CRCT investigation, and a federal review found no evidence of NAEP cheating, said Arnold Goldstein, who is program director for the assessment division of the National Center for Education Statistics, the division of the U.S. Department of Education that oversees the NAEP.\n\nThe federal review\u2019s findings were not published in a report, so PolitiFact Georgia could not examine its work.\n\nExperts agree that it\u2019s much more difficult to cheat on the NAEP than the CRCTs, and they give the following reasons:\n\n-- NAEP test administrators are federal contract workers, not APS employees, so they have little incentive to cheat. Some are retired APS teachers, but a federal testing official told PolitiFact that they all worked as part of three-member teams with colleagues who had no ties to APS.\n\n-- NAEP test materials are not kept in schools overnight or during the weekend. That\u2019s when much of the CRCT cheating took place, according to the state investigation. \u00a0\n\n-- Students are tested on multiple subjects during the same NAEP test session. While one is working on a reading exam, another might be doing mathematics, so they can\u2019t copy each others\u2019 answers.\n\nBut cheating is not out of the question. Sonny Perdue, who as governor launched the state investigation into the CRCT scores, is a member of the board that oversees the NAEP. \u00a0He suggested at an August board meeting that there may be weaknesses in the system but did not give details. He declined through a spokesman to comment for this story.\n\nAPS critics say the district might have tipped scores in its favor by withholding names of low-performing students from the roster the NAEP uses to select its test-takers.\n\nThe NAEP doesn\u2019t check student rosters by name. The procedure is to see whether the list it receives from a school matches up with the school\u2019s overall characteristics, Goldstein said.\n\nThe NAEP review found no problems, Goldstein said.\n\nBut the federal review focused on whether APS followed standard procedures -- not whether the rosters were accurate. To comply with privacy policies, NAEP administrators routinely destroy the rosters schools send them, Goldstein said. Therefore, we think it may be impossible to check whether APS sent accurate lists.\n\nNow, let\u2019s take a closer look at the NAEP results starting in 2002, which is when APS began participating in the urban district program. \u00a0\n\nWe found that even if you ignore the possibility of cheating, it\u2019s not clear the gains are dramatic.\n\nAPS previously trumpeted that since 2002, its students demonstrated the largest gains of other large urban school districts on the NAEP reading tests. This is correct, but since that time, APS\u2019 demographics have shifted toward whites and Hispanics -- groups that generally score higher on the NAEP, experts noted.\n\nFor instance, in 2002, 6 percent of APS fourth-graders were white and 3 percent were Hispanic. By 2009, the percentage of white students more than doubled to 13 percent. Hispanics increased to 5 percent.\n\n\"I think that demographic changes in the fourth grade account for 40 percent or so of the progress, but that\u2019s not something anybody wanted to talk about or even to point out,\" said Mark Musick, an East Tennessee State University professor who once was chairman of the board that directs the NAEP.\n\nAlso, APS\u2019 NAEP marks aren\u2019t all improvements. The score gap between whites and blacks remains the second-largest in the nation among large districts. In addition, children in poverty now lag even further behind their peers in reading.\n\nFurthermore, Atlanta still trails well behind other large urban districts in crucial areas. For instance, Atlanta\u2019s eighth grade 2009 mathematics scores were lower than all others but Cleveland, the District of Columbia and Los Angeles.\n\nAnd at current rates, it will take Atlanta 50 to 110 years for all its students to become proficient, said Binghamton University education professor Lawrence Stedman, who thinks that the cheating scandal is proof that the U.S. needs to scrap its approach to high-stakes testing. What gains APS made slowed in recent years, he said in a recent analysis of the district\u2019s NAEP scores.\n\nEven if we take the NAEP gains at face value, it\u2019s not accurate to say they support CRCT gains. Though student achievement rose according to both measures, NAEP gains don\u2019t quite match up to CRCT increases, and demographic shifts might account for a portion of the increase.\n\nThat said, it\u2019s not clear we can take the NAEP scores at face value. While a federal review of APS procedures found no red flags, the bulk of the district\u2019s cheating on the state CRCT exam only became public knowledge after a rigorous investigation that looked beyond procedures.\n\nSuch an inquiry has not taken place on the NAEP. And even if it did, it may not ever be possible to ensure that APS sent accurate rosters to NAEP administrators. The NAEP destroyed its copies.\n\nBoth the CRCT and NAEP registered some gains, but the causes are unclear, the results are mixed and the district\u2019s integrity remains in question. So many questions remain unanswered that it makes little sense to conclude that NAEP scores confirm \"dramatic\" gains on the CRCT.\n\nHall therefore earns a False.", "Education Week, \"Beverly Hall: The Scandal Is Not the Whole Story,\" Aug. 10, 2011\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nEducation Week, \"NAEP Cheating in Atlanta 'Extremely Unlikely,' NCES Says,\" Aug. 5, 2011\n\nAtlanta Public Schools, \"APS fourth-graders on par with students in other urban districts on national science exam,\" Feb. 25, 2011", "National Center for Education Statistics, \"The Nation\u2019s Report Card: Reading 2002 Trial Urban District Assessment,\" July 2003\n\nNational Center for Education Statistics, \"The Nation\u2019s Report Card: Mathematics 2009 Trial Urban District Assessment,\" Dec. 2009\n\nNational Center for Education Statistics, \"The Nation\u2019s Report Card: Reading 2009 Trial Urban District Assessment,\" May 2010\n\nGovernor\u2019s Office of Student Achievement, Atlanta Public Schools report cards, accessed Aug. 18, 2011\n\nNew York Times, \"A Revered Educator\u2019s Fall from Grace,\" Sept. 7, 2011\n\nCritical Education, \"A Preliminary Analysis of Atlanta\u2019s Performance on the National Assessment of Educational Progress,\" Sept. 3, 2011\n\nNational Center for Education Statistics, \"A Closer Look at Verifying the Integrity of NAEP,\" Aug. 5, 2011\n\nTelephone interview, Ben Scafidi, associate professor of economics, Georgia College & State University, Aug. 19, 2011\n\nTelephone interview, Mark Musick, James H.
