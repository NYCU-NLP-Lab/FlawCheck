Jeb Bush said at a recent debate that his plan to streamline the tax system will benefit everyone, but it will benefit the middle class the most.", "\"Look, the simple fact is that my plan actually gives the middle class the greatest break: $2,000 per family,\" Bush said during the Oct. 28, 2015, CNBC debate. He added that simplifying the tax code will boost economic growth.", "We wondered, does the middle class really stand to benefit the most from Bush\u2019s proposed tax cuts? That could be accurate if you examine the rates in a particular way, experts told us, but in practice it\u2019s likely the highest earners would see the real windfall from Bush\u2019s plan.", "The Reform and Growth Act of 2017", "Bush released his tax plan in September 2015, with an emphasis on streamlining the code, lowering rates and easing up on corporate taxes.

When we asked the Bush campaign for specifics, they referred us to the plan online, which includes a table showing their calculations for how the changes would affect certain levels of income.", "According to Bush, the savings after paying taxes are a higher percentage gain for middle incomes than for higher incomes. Some analysts and economists we contacted said that $2,000 figure could be about right, considering the difference in the 25- and 28-percent tax brackets Bush proposes.", "But one caveat is that his comparison is only counting people who take the standard deduction when filing their income tax returns. Because people with higher incomes tend to itemize, that means the sample of wealthy people to which Bush is comparing his middle class savings is much smaller than it could be.", "Vanessa Williamson, a governance studies fellow at the Brookings Institution think tank, said roughly 90 percent of people making more than $100,000 per year itemize, and higher for people who earn more than that.
