["By Joseph A. Gambardello", "Posted on March 10, 2021 | Updated on May 24, 2021", "Conservative social media posts misleadingly claim the attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 was not an \u201carmed\u201d insurrection, citing FBI testimony that no guns were seized from suspects that day. But 23 people have been charged with having deadly or dangerous weapons during the assault \u2014 including a loaded handgun found on a man arrested on Capitol grounds.", "On March 3, the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs and Senate Committee on Rules and Administration held a joint hearing on the Jan. 6 attack on Capitol Hill. The assault left five people dead and scores injured, including at least 138 Capitol and Metropolitan Police Department officers.", "During the hearing, Republican Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin asked Jill Sanborn, assistant director of the FBI\u2019s Counterterrorism Division, \u201cHow many firearms were confiscated in the Capitol or on Capitol grounds during that day?\u201d", "\u201cTo my knowledge, we have not recovered any on that day from any other arrests at the scene at this point,\u201d Sanborn said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to speak on behalf of Metro and Capitol Police.\u201d", "Social media posts latched on to the answer to misleadingly purport that the protesters were not armed.", "One meme, showing a photo of protesters inside the Capitol, falsely claimed: \u201cSenate testimony this week confirms that no Capitol protesters were armed and not a single weapon was found. Clearly NOT insurrection, NOT an attempt to overthrow the government, just out of control protestors that saw inadequate security and ran thru the building.\u201d", "An article on the conservative website Gateway Pundit \u2014 which was cited on the website of conservative commentator David Harris Jr. \u2014 carried the headline: \u201cAnother Democrat-Media Narrative Goes Up in Flames: FBI Official Admits No Firearms Were Confiscated by Law Enforcement at Capitol Riot.\u201d", "But a wide array of lethal weapons \u2014 including a firearm \u2014 were found on protesters at the Capitol.", "The Metropolitan Police Department reported its officers, while trying to clear the Capitol grounds about 7 p.m. on Jan. 6, arrested and charged a 33-year-old Maryland man with the federal offense of carrying a fully loaded 9mm semi-automatic handgun on Capitol grounds.", "Clarification, June 25: In response to a reader\u2019s inquiry, we\u00a0updated this story to clarify that Christopher Michael Alberts was arrested by Metropolitan Police on Jan. 6 for carrying a pistol without a license, possession of a firearm on Capital grounds and other charges. He was formally charged in U.S. District Court on Jan. 7.", "Social media posts claiming that protesters were not armed also do not address the issue of other weapons used by assailants at the Capitol \u2014 or the seizure of guns from supporters before and after the riot.", "In legal terms, \u201carmed\u201d means being in possession of any weapon, not just a firearm. While there are laws that specifically address firearms, weapons can include virtually any object used to threaten or cause harm.", "According to a database compiled by NPR, of the people charged with violent offenses, including assault on police officers, 15 were armed with deadly or dangerous weapons during the riot at the Capitol.", "Eight others facing civil disorder or property destruction charges also were charged with possessing weapons, according to the database.", "Those weapons included baseball bats, chemical sprays, a captured police officer\u2019s riot shield, a crowbar, fire extinguishers and a metal flagpole.", "Thomas Webster, a retired New York Police Department officer, was charged with attacking a Metropolitan Police Department officer with a metal flagpole. The\u00a0federal complaint\u00a0says he struck at the officer \u201cwith the flagpole numerous times.\u201d", "Before and after the storming of the Capitol,\u00a0NBC News reported, police seized a dozen firearms, including an assault rifle, and thousands of rounds of ammunition from seven people attending the rally for President Donald Trump in Washington, D.C. Other weapons included a crossbow, a stun gun and 11 Molotov cocktails.", "The FBI, in a statement to FactCheck.org on March 5, said Sanborn had testified \u201cin her capacity as the FBI Assistant Director of the Counterterrorism Division. Her responses were restricted to FBI investigative matters and she appropriately deferred to other law enforcement partners for their information.\u201d", "Asha Rangappa, an attorney and former FBI agent, told us in an email that she did \u201cnot see the logic\u201d in the claim that firearms had to be present for the Capitol riot to have been deemed an armed insurrection.", "She also said we will never know how many rioters might have been armed with guns on Jan. 6, because only some were arrested that day.", "\u201cNot only was law enforcement completely overwhelmed (and being assaulted), from what I saw people were basically allowed to leave unimpeded,\u201d said Rangappa, a senior lecturer at Yale University\u2019s Jackson Institute for Global Affairs. \u201cSo those arrested \u2026 are hardly representative of everyone who was there that day.\u201d", "Update, May 24: The\u00a0Capitol Police\u00a0and the\u00a0Justice Department\u00a0initially reported that\u00a0Capitol Police Officer Brian\u00a0Sicknick\u00a0died as a result of injuries sustained during the riot. In April, the Washington Post\u00a0reported\u00a0that District of Columbia Chief Medical Examiner Francisco J. Diaz found that Sicknick suffered two strokes nearly eight hours after being sprayed with a chemical irritant during the riot. Diaz told the Post that Sicknick died of natural causes, but \u201call that transpired played a role in his condition.\u201d", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
