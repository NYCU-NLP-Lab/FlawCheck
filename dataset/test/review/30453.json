["By Eugene Kiely", "Posted on January 12, 2018", "Democratic House leader Nancy Pelosi claimed that the new tax law will provide \u201cat least a $1.3 trillion tax break for corporations.\u201d That\u2019s misleading.", "It\u2019s true that the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that cutting the top corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent will reduce federal tax revenues by $1.35 trillion over 10 years \u2014 the figure that Pelosi cited. But she ignored other tax changes in the new law that will increase taxes for corporations, resulting in a net savings of less than half of that.", "In its entirety, the new law will cut taxes by an estimated $1.5 trillion over 10 years for all taxpayers, including $1.1 trillion for individual taxpayers, according to the JCT.", "Pelosi criticized the Republican tax cut at her weekly press conference on Jan. 11. \u201cThere is up to at least a $1.3 trillion tax break for corporations unpaid for,\u201d she said.", "Her office said she was referring to\u00a0the cut in the corporate tax rate. But that is just one line item of many in the JCT\u2019s analysis of the new law\u2019s budget effects over 10 years.", "The congressional nonpartisan experts grouped the tax changes contained in the new law into three categories: \u201cindividual tax reform,\u201d which results in a net $1.1 trillion tax cut, \u201cinternational tax reform,\u201d which results in a tax increase of $324 billion, and \u201cbusiness tax reform,\u201d which results in a net tax cut of about $654 billion.", "\u201cThe Joint Tax Committee estimates that all the business tax provisions will reduce receipts by $654 billion between 2018 and 2027,\u201d Eric Toder, co-director of the Tax Policy Center, told us via email. \u201cThus, other provisions are estimated to offset slightly more than half of the $1.35 trillion revenue loss from reducing the corporate tax rate to 21 percent.\u201d", "Here are some of the changes in the \u201cbusiness tax reform\u201d category that will increase\u00a0tax revenue, according to the JCT:", "Toder said that some of these changes will affect not just corporations but also pass-through businesses, such as sole proprietorships, LLCs and partnerships. The owners of these companies do not pay corporate taxes; they pay individual income taxes on their share of business income.", "However, of the tax increases listed above, Toder said that \u201cthe interest deduction limitation is probably almost all corporate, modification of the net operating loss deduction is all corporate, and the amortization of R&D and domestic production deduction mostly affect corporate businesses.\u201d", "\u201cIn addition,\u201d Toder said, \u201cJCT estimates that the international tax reform provisions will raise $324 billion, almost all from corporations, over 10 years.\u201d But Toder said that nearly all of the revenue gain comes a one-time, discounted tax rate on foreign profits that U.S. multinational corporations have kept overseas since 1986.", "\u201cExcluding this temporary provision, the international provisions reduce receipts over 10 years by $16 billion,\u201d Toder said.", "Pelosi\u2019s misleading claim is the flip side of President Donald Trump\u2019s equally misleading claim that the new law will provide \u201c$3.2 trillion \u2026 in tax cuts for American families.\u201d", "As we wrote in that case,\u00a0changes to the tax code would, on\u00a0net, result in a little more than $1.1 trillion less being paid in individual taxes over the next 10 years. Like Pelosi, Trump was not counting provisions of the new law that increase taxes.", "Editor\u2019s note: For more about the impact of the new tax law, please see our item \u201cA Guide to the Tax Changes.\u201d", "FactCheck.org Rating:", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
