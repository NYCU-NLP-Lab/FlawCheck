["By Robert Farley", "Posted on October 23, 2017", "President Donald Trump says Democratic obstruction is the reason far fewer of his political nominees have been confirmed compared with his predecessors. But a\u00a0group tracking the nominations says Trump is partly to blame for the lower numbers.", "\u201cYou look at Clinton: 357 versus 182. You look at President Obama: 364 versus 182,\u201d Trump said.", "Data show Trump has simply nominated fewer people \u2014 something he said a week before was by design to reduce government waste.", "Data also show, to Trump\u2019s point, that his nominees are taking longer to get approval \u2014 on average 62 days compared with 46 days for President Barack Obama and 32 days for President George W. Bush.", "Experts say that while Democrats bear some of the blame for putting up procedural speed bumps, the Trump administration also bears some responsibility because many of Trump\u2019s early nominees were put forward without the necessary paperwork, such as security clearances and financial disclosures.", "The issue of nominees came up during a joint press conference with Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Oct. 16, when a reporter asked Trump about his past criticism of Obama complaining about Republicans stopping his agenda. Trump said the difference is that Democrats are \u201cholding up every single nomination\u201d Trump has put forth.", "Here\u2019s the exchange:", "Reporter, Oct. 16: Mr. President, in 2012 you tweeted that Obama\u2019s complaints about Republicans stopping his agenda are \u201cB.S.,\u201d in your words, since he had full control for two years. You wrote, \u201cHe can never take responsibility.\u201d", "But today, you said about some of the challenges right now in Congress and in Washington, \u201cI\u2019m not going to blame myself. I\u2019ll be honest. They\u2019re not getting the job done.\u201d", "So what\u2019s different then than now?", "Trump: Well, let me just explain what\u2019s different.", "We have nominations pending right now, and we have 182 approve \u2014 if you look at this, the number that he had approved was 65 percent and 70 percent, and we have 39 percent.", "They\u2019re holding up every single nomination. Schumer and the group are holding up every single nomination. They are obstructing. They\u2019re doing \u2014 it\u2019s really what \u2014 I\u2019m telling you, they\u2019re not good politicians, but they\u2019re very good at obstruction.", "They are holding up every single nomination. And I will tell you, Peter, it\u2019s not right. It\u2019s really not right. They\u2019ll bring them right out to the end, that last minute. What they\u2019re doing is unfair. So you look at even Bush, you look at Obama, you look at Clinton and you look at Bush original: you have 389 versus 182. These are approvals. You look at Clinton: 357 versus 182. You look at President Obama: 364 versus 182. These are nominations approved, and what they\u2019re doing to us.", "We have unbelievable people and they\u2019re waiting to be approved. They\u2019ve been waiting for a long period of time.", "Trump\u2019s numbers are roughly accurate. A joint project of The Partnership for Public Service and the Washington Post\u00a0tracks roughly 600 \u201ckey executive branch nominations through the confirmation process\u201d (out of the roughly 1,200 positions that require Senate confirmation). According to the project\u2019s data, on the day Trump made his comment, the Senate had confirmed 174 of his 416 nominations. By comparison, his predecessors had far more confirmed by this stage \u2014 Obama had 359; George W. Bush, 375; Bill Clinton, 340; and George H.W. Bush, 293.", "But the data also show that Trump\u2019s immediate predecessors had nominated a larger number of people by this point as well. While Trump has nominated 416, Obama at this point had nominated 534. George W. Bush had nominated 510 and Clinton, 450. (To see a graphic representation of the slower pace of Trump\u2019s nominations since his inauguration compared with past presidents, see this Washington Post analysis.)", "During the summer, some Republicans expressed frustration with the slower pace of formal nominations coming from the administration.", "In an interview with Forbes published on Oct. 10, Trump said the lower number of nominees submitted for Senate approval was by design because many of the positions are \u201cunnecessary.\u201d", "Trump, Forbes interview, Oct. 10: I\u2019m generally not going to make a lot of the appointments that would normally be\u2014because you don\u2019t need them. I mean, you look at some of these agencies, how massive they are, and it\u2019s totally unnecessary. They have hundreds of thousands of people.", "Trump is correct that among the nominees he has put forth, the time it has taken to get them confirmed is longer than for past presidents. On average, The Partnership for Public Service reports, it is taking 62 days to get Trump\u2019s nominees confirmed. That\u2019s longer than the 46 days it took on average for Obama\u2019s nominees to get confirmed, and nearly double the time it took for George W. Bush\u2019s nominees (32 days) and Clinton\u2019s (34 days).", "Democrats and Republicans have blamed each other for the longer confirmation times. Mallory Barg-Bulman, vice president of research and evaluation at The Partnership for Public Service, told us both sides have contributed to the delays.", "Although Democrats have few tools available to them as the minority party \u2014 a 2013 rules change took away the ability to filibuster nominees \u2014 they are able to call for floor debate on nominees. Democrats have invoked \u201ccloture\u201d\u00a0\u2014 which triggers 30 hours of debate prior to final action \u2014 on 40 of Trump\u2019s nominees so far. That has added delays, said Barg-Bulman.", "But the Trump administration also bears some responsibility for the longer lag time, she said. An inordinate number of Trump\u2019s nominees \u2014 particularly early in his presidency \u2014 were put forward without proper paperwork, she said. That includes security clearances and financial background statements to ensure there are no financial conflicts of interest with the job for which the person was nominated.", "In recent months, Trump has ramped up the number of his nominations, but the total is still lower than previous presidents.", "Trump has a legitimate gripe that confirmations have taken longer on average than they did for his predecessors, but the lower number of confirmations is partly due to his administration\u2019s slower pace in putting people forward.", "FactCheck.org Rating:", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
