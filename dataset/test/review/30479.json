["About this rating", "An exchange between Costco founder Jim Sinegal and Costco CEO Craig Jelinek over the cost of their hot dog and soda combination \u2014 a staple of the brand that has not changed since 1985 \u2014\u00a0 frequently goes viral on social media. As the story goes, Jelinek wanted to raise the price of the hot dog combo, and Sinegal did not take it well:", "The exchange, based on the testimony of Jelinek \u2014\u00a0 the CEO who wanted to raise the price \u2014 is factual. He discussed it in an April 12, 2018, speech to a local chamber of commerce. His remarks, which were part of a broader message about problem solving, were summarized in several places including the website 425 Business:", "\u201cI came to (Jim Sinegal) once and I said, \u2018Jim, we can\u2019t sell this hot dog for a buck fifty. We are losing our rear ends.\u2019 And he said, \u2018If you raise the effing hot dog, I will kill you. Figure it out.\u2019 That\u2019s all I really needed. By the way, if you raised (the price) to $1.75, it would not be that big of a deal. People would still buy (it). But it\u2019s the mindset that when you think of Costco, you think of the $1.50 hot dog (and soda).", "\u201cWhat we figured out we could do is build our own hot dog-manufacturing plant (in Los Angeles) and make our own Kirkland Signature hot dogs. Now we are doing so much hot dog business that we\u2019ve opened up another plant in Chicago.", "\u201cBy having the discipline to say, \u2018You are not going to be able to raise your price. You have to figure it out,\u2019 we took it over and started manufacturing our hot dogs. We keep it at $1.50 and make enough money to get a fair return.\u201d", "Because the story comes from Jelinek himself, the claim is true.", "Alex Kasprak is an investigative journalist and science writer reporting on scientific misinformation, online fraud, and financial crime.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
