John McCain sounded upbeat in a Halloween morning interview on CNBC. But was the enthusiasm just a mask?", "We can't be sure. But we can check some data McCain cited to justify his optimism.", "\"I'm very optimistic, and we're coming from behind,\" McCain told anchor Larry Kudlow in the Oct. 31, 2008, interview. \"I'm the underdog. There's where we always like to be. But we are within the margin of error, my friends. And I'm very happy where we are.\"", "McCain was clearly talking about national polls, which are not necessarily indicative of Electoral College results. Nevertheless, only four presidents have won the election without winning the national popular vote \u2014 John Quincy Adams in 1824, Rutherford B. Hayes in 1876, Benjamin Harrison in 1888 and George W. Bush in 2000.", "So we looked at every national poll we could find from the day McCain spoke and the day before\u00a0to see if he really was within the margin of error.", "Five polls were released the same morning McCain was speaking.\n\nRasmussen's daily tracking poll\n\n\u00a0showed Obama up 51 to 47 with a margin of error of\u00a0plus or minus\u00a02 percentage points. That means if one gives McCain the full benefit of the margin of error, his score could be as high\u00a0as 49 percent (his 47 plus the 2-point margin of error) and Obama's could be as\n\nlow\n\nas 49 percent (his 51 minus the margin of error). There's a very low probability of that outcome, but still, it's within the margin of error.", "The method we employed above of factoring in the margin of error is the one most commonly used by pollsters and political scientists. Some statisticians quibble with it and use a more complicated calculation, but we think it's fair to judge McCain's claim by the most common measure. (We can say for certain that another method\u00a0the media commonly use \u2014 saying a race is within the margin of error only if the gap between the candidates is smaller than the margin of error \u2014 is wrong. You have to apply the margin to\n\nboth\n\ncandidates' scores.)", "Let's look at more polls from Oct. 31.
