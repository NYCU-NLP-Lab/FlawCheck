["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "President Barack Obama\u2019s nomination of former Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., as defense secretary is expected to create a hotly contested fight about his comments on Israel and Iran.\n\nPro-Israel hawks have cast a portrait of Hagel as too soft on Iran and not chummy enough with Israel. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said a day before the Jan. 7 announcement that if confirmed, Hagel would be \"the most antagonistic secretary of defense towards the State of Israel in our nation's history.\"\n\nThe Hagel nomination comes two months after Obama won re-election amid much debate about Obama\u2019s relationship with Israel. Obama still won the vast majority of the Jewish vote, but by less than 2008.\u00a0\n\nThe Emergency Committee for Israel, a pro-Israel group whose board members include high-profile conservatives Bill Kristol and Gary Bauer, aired an\u00a0ad in December attacking Hagel, even before Obama officially announced his pick to replace Leon Panetta who is retiring.\n\n\"Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel?\" asks a disgusted sounding narrator. \"President Obama says he supports sanctions on Iran. Hagel voted against them. Hagel voted against labeling Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guard a terrorist group. And while President Obama says all options are on the table for preventing a nuclear Iran, Hagel says military action is not a viable, feasible, responsible option. President Obama, for secretary of defense Chuck Hagel is not a responsible option.\"\n\nThere are a lot of claims in that ad, but we wanted to check if Obama and Hagel disagreed about military options for preventing a nuclear Iran. We contacted the Emergency Committee for Israel about the ad and did not get a response.\n\nWe also did not get a response from the White House. But in a press briefing the day Obama announced his nomination of Hagel, White House spokesman Jay Carney defended Hagel as a \"staunch supporter of Israel\" and \"a supporter of the broad sanctions regime that this President has put into place against Iran... .\"\n\nHagel told a newspaper in his home state of Nebraska that critics have distorted his views on Israel and Iran, but he did not directly address whether he would favor striking Iran.\n\nObama has said regularly that he leaves all options on the table to prevent a nuclear Iran. Here\u2019s a representative comment from the 2012 AIPAC conference: \"I have said that when it comes to preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, I will take no options off the table, and I mean what I say. That includes all elements of American power: A political effort aimed at isolating Iran; a diplomatic effort to sustain our coalition and ensure that the Iranian program is monitored; an economic effort that imposes crippling sanctions; and, yes, a military effort to be prepared for any contingency.\"\n\nHagel\u2019s record\n\nHagel, a decorated Vietnam veteran, was first elected to the U.S. Senate in Nebraska in 1996 and served two terms, including serving on the Foreign Relations Committee before he retired in 2008.\n\nHagel\u2019s experiences on the battlefront made him cautious about war. \"I'm not a pacifist. I believe in using force but only after a very careful decision-making process. \u2026 I will do everything I can to avoid needless, senseless war,\" he said in an interview with Vietnam magazine.\n\nHagel voted to give President George W. Bush the authority to go to war against Afghanistan and Iraq but was later critical of those wars, creating a wedge between him and the GOP, including a rebuke from former Vice President Dick Cheney.\n\nHagel also drew fire for comments he made in 2006 to author and former State Department Mideast peace negotiator Aaron David Miller. \"The Jewish lobby intimidates a lot of people up here,\" Hagel said, but \"I'm a United States senator. I'm not an Israeli senator.\"\n\nMiller recently wrote that accusations that Hagel is anti-semitic \"is shameful and scurrilous.\"", "While some of Hagel\u2019s views are out of sync with current U.S. policy, it won\u2019t matter because Obama controls foreign policy, Miller wrote.\n\nHagel on Iran\n\nThe ad attacking Hagel cites a Dec. 13, 2012, article from the Washington Post leaving the viewer to believe that Hagel made that statement about Iran on the eve of his nomination. But the Post article recapped various Hagel comments -- including that particular one, which actually goes back to 2006.\n\nWe did our own research and reviewed multiple comments Hagel made in speeches and interviews between 2005 and 2012. We found that Hagel repeatedly called on the U.S. to engage Iran in direct discussions and expressed concern that a military attack on Iran could lead to widespread counter-attacks.\n\nBut his caution was at least in part borne from the fact that we were already engaged in wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nOn CNN in April 2006, an interviewer asked Hagel if diplomacy failed, if the U.S. should pursue a military strike.\n\nHagel\u2019s response including these comments: \"Well, first of all, I think we have to recognize that this Iranian issue does represent a real threat to the United States. ... unlike Iraq. This is a real legitimate issue. And I think, before we charge off in going off to another war -- we're in two of them now, in Afghanistan and Iraq -- we'd better think through this one carefully and clearly. I think it's going to require an engagement directly with the Iranians.\"\n\nLater in 2006, Hagel visited Pakistan.\n\nPakistani Press International reported that Hagel ruled out any military action against Iran. \"I do not expect any kind of military solution on the Iran issue,\" Hagel said, adding President George W. Bush and senior members of his cabinet had said the military option was not a responsible approach to resolving the issues. \"I think to further comment on it would be complete speculation, but I would say that a military strike against Iran, a military option, is not a viable, feasible, responsible option.\"\u2019 (This is the comment the ad directly quotes.)\n\nIn 2012, Hagel still expressed caution about military intervention, but didn\u2019t specifically rule it out.\n\nIn a March 2012 interview with the news website Al-Monitor, Hagel said that we should not be locked into one of two options or \"false choices.\"\n\nThe interviewer then suggested as a false choice: \"Bomb Iran or live with Iran with a bomb?\"\n\nHagel responded: \"Exactly. We may eventually wind up with those choices. But I don\u2019t think we\u2019re there now. We\u2019ve got some time, keep ratcheting up the sanctions, keep the world community with you. \u2026 You cannot push the Iranians into a corner where they can\u2019t get out \u2026You\u2019ve got to find some quiet ways \u2013 and you don\u2019t do this in the press or by giving speeches \u2013 to give them a couple of facing saving ways out of this thing so they get something out of this, too. And recognizing internally what\u2019s going on in Iran; things are not going particularly well. Let that play out\u2026 So you work this thing on a number of parallel tracks.\"\n\nHagel criticized the Republican presidential candidates, saying \"they can hardly race to say who would bomb Iran first; it\u2019s just amazing.\"\n\nIn a September 2012, Hagel co-wrote a Washington Post op-ed that specifically included military options: \"Our position is fully consistent with the policy of presidents for more than a decade of keeping all options on the table, including the use of military force, thereby increasing pressure on Iran while working toward a political solution. Since the consequences of a military attack are so significant for U.S. interests, we seek to ensure that the spectrum of objectives, as well as potential consequences, is understood.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nThe Emergency Committee for Israel said in an ad, \"And while President Obama says all options are on the table for preventing a nuclear Iran Hagel says military action is not a viable, feasible, responsible option.\"\n\nObama clearly has said all options are on the table. But the ad portrays Hagel\u2019s comments as occurring in December 2012, he actually stated them in 2006. In the past, Hagel did repeatedly warn against jumping into another war and called for discussions with Iran, but the comments the ad cites were made when the United States was engaged in war in both Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nIn 2012 in an op-ed he co-wrote, Hagel called for \"keeping all options on the table, including the use of military force, thereby increasing pressure on Iran while working toward a political solution.\"\n\nWe rate this claim Mostly False.", "Emergency Committee \u00a0for Israel, \"Chuck \u00a0Hagel: Not an option,\" ad, Dec. 19, 2012\n\nCNN, Transcript of State of the Union with Candy Crowley, Jan. \u00a06, 2013\n\nWashington Post, \"Gay rights activists voice doubts about Chuck Hagel as prospective defense secretary,\"Dec. 20, 2012\n\nWashington Post, \"Hagel retracts 1998 statement on gays, Human Rights Campaign accepts,\"Dec. 21, 2012\n\nThe Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life, \"How the faithful voted: 2012 preliminary analysis,\" Nov. 7, 2012\n\nLincoln Star-Journal, \"Exclusive: Hagel says critics distort his views on Israel, Iran,\"Jan. 7, 2013\n\nWhite House, \u00a0Jay Carney press briefing, Jan. 7, 2013\n\nWhite House, \u00a0Remarks by President at AIPAC Policy Conference, \u00a0March 4, 2012\n\nThe Atlantic, \"Obama to Iran and Israel: as President of the United States, I don\u2019t bluff,\" March 2, 2012\n\nPOLITICO, Transcript of third presidential debate, Oct. 22, 2012\n\nThe Atlantic Council, Chuck Hagel, Accessed Jan. 8, 2013\n\nLos Angeles Times, \"Chuck Hagel\u2019s nomination as defense secretary to come Monday,\" Jan. 6, 2013\n\nLos Angeles Times, \"Obama likely to nominate Chuck Hagel for defense secretary,\"Jan. 4, 2013\n\nMother Jones, \"Hagel\u2019s half-courageous stand on the Iraq war,\"Jan. 7, 2013\n\nReuters, \"Chuck Hagel forged bond with Obama on Iraq,\"Jan. 6, 2013\n\nForeign Policy, \"Is Chuck Hagel toast?\"Dec. 24, 2012\n\nWashington Post, \u00a0\"Chuck Hagel\u2019s ambiguous stance on dealing with Iran,\"Dec. 13, 2012\n\nCouncil on Foreign Relations, \"A conversation with Senator Chuck Hagel on the Middle-East and U.S. Foreign Policy,\"Nov. 15, 2005\n\nCouncil on Foreign Relations, \"A conversation with Senator Chuck Hagel,\" May 8, 2007\n\nAtlantic Council, \"Chuck Hagel delivers speech for J Street First National Conference,\"Oct. 27, 2009\n\nAl-Monitor, \"Hagel praises Obama on Syria, chides GOP on Iran,\" March 2012\n\nCNN, Transcript of interview with Sen.
