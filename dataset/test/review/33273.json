The English banners read \u201cUnited Airlines\u201d and \u201cWe Will Be Back\u201d, and the simplified Chinese banners read \u201cChengdu add oil!\u201d, \u201cChina add oil!\u201d and \u201cWe will see each other soon\u201d.", "\u201cAdd oil\u201d is a Chinese phrase often used to express encouragement or support.", "The post\u2019s caption, written in simplified Chinese characters, translates to English as: \u201cRecently, the United States issued a 72-hour ultimatum to the Chinese Communist Party, asking them to close and evacuate from the Chinese Embassy in Houston (a spy centre). The Chinese Communist Party was filmed burning a large number of confidential documents in the middle of the night. As a result, the Chinese Communist Party went furious and ordered a direct closure of the US embassy in Chengdu today.", "\u201cBefore leaving, the staff of the US embassy in Chengdu did not burn any documents. Instead, they raised banners to cheer for Chengdu! Cheer for China! Chinese people have forgotten the sense of propriety, justice, honesty and honour, and should really learn from these American people!\u201d", "US-China relations spiralled in late July after the US consulate in the Chinese city of Chengdu was ordered to close, in retaliation for the forced closure of Beijing's consulate in Houston, Texas.
