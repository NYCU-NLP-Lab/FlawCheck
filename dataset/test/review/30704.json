We found a lot of full-page cigarette ads, a feature about roller skating and a cover story documenting images of \"man\u2019s closest look at Saturn.\" What we did not find was any evidence that Soros ever said such a thing.", "Further, we searched news clips more broadly and found no legitimate record that he said this in any other publication or interview either.

I\u2019m not on top of the financial markets. I just don\u2019t have adequate information on detail so I can only use blunt instruments that are sort of macroeconomic instruments.
