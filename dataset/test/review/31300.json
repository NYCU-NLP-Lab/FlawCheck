Opening the 15-minute interview, which aired the next morning, Jones stressed the location, saying: \"We\u2019re sitting here in the area where the cheerleaders perform. I\u2019ll get my little plug in there.\"", "Then Jones said: \"They\u2019ve entertained more troops in the world than Bob Hope.\"", "Now this isn\u2019t politics. But Jones made his claim in Texas and the late Hope, friend to presidents and world leaders, would surely holler for the Truth-O-Meter if he could, maybe waving a golf club.", "Hope and the troops", "Over decades, often around Christmas, Hope flew the globe to put on shows for U.S. troops. In his later years, the shows were taped as TV specials.", "According to a web page for the USO, the nonprofit dedicated to lifting the spirits of troops, Hope performed his first USO show in California in May 1941. \"Hope entertained\" with the USO \"until December 1990, when he brought laughter and Christmas cheer to troops participating in Operation Desert Shield in Saudi Arabia and Bahrain on his final USO tour,\" the page says.

They bring their own special brand of goodwill and gratitude to the men and women in the military, traveling to locations as diverse as Iraq, Bosnia, Afghanistan, Cuba, Korea and the Persian Gulf.\" Through 2014, the team told us, the cheerleaders had teamed up the government 78 times \"to boost the morale of the men, women and families of our U.S. military at hundreds of bases and outposts around the world.\"", "Separately, USO spokeswoman Sharee Posey emailed that since 2002, the Cowboys cheerleaders had entertained more\u00a0than 198,000 troops and\u00a0military families.
