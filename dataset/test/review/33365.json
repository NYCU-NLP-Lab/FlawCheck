["By Eugene Kiely", "Posted on November 16, 2018", "Rep. Ted Deutch accused Florida Gov. Rick Scott of \u201ctrying to manipulate the outcome of elections,\u201d providing examples that went beyond the facts:", "Deutch, a Democrat who represents parts of Broward and Palm Beach counties, made his remarks during an interview on CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day.\u201d The congressman talked about counting the ballots in two of Florida\u2019s extremely close statewide races \u2014\u00a0the\u00a0governor\u2019s race\u00a0between Tallahassee\u00a0Democrat Andrew Gillum and\u00a0former Republican Rep. Ron DeSantis, and\u00a0the Senate race between Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson and outgoing Republican Gov. Rick Scott.", "As both parties haggle over how to carry out yet another Florida recount, Deutch said \u2014 correctly \u2014 that there is no evidence of fraud in Broward County. He then went on to attack Scott.", "\u201cThere is evidence of eight years of Rick Scott as the governor of Florida trying to manipulate the outcome of elections,\u201d Deutch said, before launching into some examples.", "In one example, Deutch took issue with the legal wrangling over voting machines in Broward County, the state\u2019s second most populous county.", "Deutch, Nov. 12:\u00a0The governor has now actually taken the unheard of approach of trying to use his own state police to impound voting machines before this election is even over.", "It is not unheard of for campaigns to seek a post-election court order to impound the ballots \u2014 which is what Scott\u2019s campaign, not the governor or the governor\u2019s office, did in this case.", "On Nov. 11, the Scott campaign filed a lawsuit against Brenda Snipes, the Broward County supervisor of elections, in state circuit court. \u201cThese filings request that FDLE [Florida Department of Law Enforcement] and the Sheriff\u2019s Office be required to impound and secure all voting machines, tallying devices and ballots when they are not in use until the conclusion of the recount,\u201d the campaign said.", "Florida Democratic Party Executive Director Juan Pe\u00f1alosa issued a statement comparing the governor to a dictator for filing the lawsuit.", "\u201cIn suing to seize ballots and impound voting machines, Rick Scott is doing his best to impersonate Latin American dictators who have overthrown democracies in Venezuela and Cuba,\u201d Pe\u00f1alosa said. \u201cThe governor is using his position to consolidate power by cutting at the very core of Democracy.\u201d", "But, contrary to Deutch\u2019s claim, it is not \u201cunheard of\u201d for campaigns in Florida to file suit seeking a court order to impound voting machines or paper ballots.", "In 2006, the campaign for a Democratic congressional candidate, Christine Jennings,\u00a0filed a lawsuit asking a circuit court judge to impound electronic voting machines used in Sarasota County. And, in 2012, Rep. Allen West\u2019s campaign sought a court order to require elections officials to impound ballots and voting machines. Both candidates lost, despite their legal actions.", "In Scott\u2019s case, the state\u2019s judicial system \u2014 acting not at all like\u00a0a dictatorship \u2014 ruled against the governor\u2019s campaign and came up with a practical alternative that was acceptable to both sides.", "At the suggestion of Circuit Chief Judge Jack Tuter, lawyers for both campaigns agreed to add three more sheriff\u2019s deputies to secure the location of the county\u2019s voting machines.", "In accusing Scott of\u00a0\u201ctrying to manipulate the outcome of elections,\u201d\u00a0Deutch also said, \u201cHe did it by making the number of voting places during early voting \u2014 by reducing the number of early voting locations.\u201d", "In fact, the number of early voting locations increased under Scott.", "Deutch was referring to a bill that Scott signed into law in 2011\u00a0that reduced the number of early voting days and hours. The new law was cited as one reason for long lines at the polls in 2012.", "\u201cThe 2011 changes, as well as the Legislature\u2019s decision to add several lengthy constitutional amendments to the ballot, resulted in long lines at polls in several urban areas of the state, particularly Miami Dade where some voters waited more than eight hours to cast ballots,\u201d the Miami Herald wrote.", "But in response to the long lines, and under public pressure to act, the governor reversed course\u00a0two years later and\u00a0signed a bill that restored and expanded early voting.", "\u201cThe law not only restores the early voting to a mandatory 64 hours over eight days and up to 168 hours over 14 days, it also gives the 67 county supervisors of elections the discretion to schedule early voting on the Sunday before the election,\u201d the Herald wrote of the 2013 law.", "Specifically, Deutch accused the governor of \u201creducing the number of early voting locations.\u201d But data we reviewed on the Florida Department of State website show that the number of early voting locations increased in every general election during Scott\u2019s eight years.", "In 2010, before Scott took office, the state had 257 early polling places in 67 counties. After Scott assumed office in January 2011, the number of early polling places increased to 289 in 2012, 333 in 2014, 351 in 2016 and 367 in 2018.", "Deutch has a point about the legislation Scott signed in 2011, but he ignores the 2013 bill that the governor also signed. Deutch is also wrong to say that Scott \u201creduced the number of early voting locations.\u201d", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
