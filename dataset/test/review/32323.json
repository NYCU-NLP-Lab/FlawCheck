["The Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act says insurers must provide equal coverage of physical and mental health. The ACA made it a requirement for insurers to cover certain benefits which included behavioral health. (TNS).", "During a July visit to Milwaukee, Democratic presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren told an audience that when it comes to their mental health needs, their health insurer may not always be on their side.", "According to the Massachusetts senator, that\u2019s because there is an unequal playing field when it comes to coverage of physical and mental health needs.", "\"The law says that mental health must be treated the same as physical health,\" Warren said at the League of United Latin American Citizens convention in Milwaukee on July 11, 2019, referencing the idea that health providers don\u2019t care equally for the two.", "Warren was among eight Democratic presidential contenders, plus Jill Biden, wife of candidate Joe Biden, who attended the convention.

Mental health and substance use disorder services were also included as benefits.", "Hayden also pointed to the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act, sponsored by then-U.S. senators Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici, which was enacted in October 2008.

In those reviews, insurers -- not doctors -- decide whether a patient requires a certain treatment and at what frequency.", "Additionally, only a few states have checked up on whether insurers are complying with parity laws, and the U.S. government has not taken any public enforcement action against an insurer or employer for violating the law since it was passed, according to the Kaiser report.", "Lawsuits against insurers alleging a lack of parity have been filed in states such as New York, Illinois and California where patients ran into issues regarding coverage for their mental health.", "Enforcement challenges of health care laws", "Ben Miller, chief strategy officer of Well Being Trust, an Oakland-based nonprofit focused on health issues, said one reason the parity law is hard to enforce is because most people don\u2019t have a clear understanding of their health care coverage.", "\"We do not have clear transparency as ultimately what a health insurer might be doing,\" he said. \"Health insurance is like a black box.\"", "Secondly, he said it\u2019s time consuming to enforce it.", "\"States could easily step up and enforce the federal law,\" Miller said. \"I just don\u2019t think that\u2019s something that happens very often.\"", "Our ruling", "Warren claimed mental health and physical health have to be treated the same under the law, but coverage by health insurers is unequal.", "The Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act says insurers must provide equal coverage of physical and mental health.
