["Amid mounting concern about the role of mail-in ballots in the upcoming election, one social media user posted a photo of dozen boxes of mail discarded on the side of the road.", "\"Boy oh boy, there\u00a0finding thrown away Trump ballets (sic)\u00a0everywhere now, California, Texas, n Pennsylvania,\" Kimberly C. Lecroy wrote on Facebook alongside the image. \"How does the USPO explain this??\"", "Lecroy did not respond to a request from USA TODAY for comment.", "Fact check:2018 empty mail-in ballot envelopes in California dumpster spur false fraud claims", "In reality, the\u00a0photo Lecroy posted is unrelated to the 2020 election.", "The image\u00a0first appeared on Facebook on Sept. 30, 2018, when a user posted it with the caption, \"If your looking for your mail\u00a0it maybe on river road by 36st station...\"", "That post was shared thousands of times, prompting U.S. Postal Service Office of Inspector General\u00a0Special Agent Scott Balfour to investigate the incident, per NJ.com.", "Balfour concluded the mail had been out for delivery from the Roxborough Station Post Office in Philadelphia\u00a0on Aug. 8, 2018, when the worker who was tasked with dropping it off decided instead to dump it on the side of the road.", "Agents tracked down the employee who threw out the mail, but learned that employee had already resigned on Sept. 8, 2018.", "\"We do not anticipate any further action against this individual,\" Balfour said at the time. \"The Roxborough Station Post Office is going to deliver the mail.\"", "It's impossible that there were any ballots for President Donald Trump in the batch of mail; he was not up for reelection in 2018.", "Fact check:California offers fewer polling places but more time to vote in person", "Independent of the photo, Lecroy\u00a0claims in her post that ballots for Trump have been found \"thrown away ... everywhere now,\" including California, Texas, and Pennsylvania.", "In reality, there have been no true reports of ballots for Trump discarded in California or Texas.", "Claims that sealed mail-in ballots were found in\u00a0a dumpster in California, for example, were false, because the materials\u00a0were actually empty envelopes from a previous election, recycled after the mandated ballot preservation period.", "The one report of discarded ballots in Pennsylvania was not related to the U.S. Postal Service, as Lecroy suggests.", "On Sept. 24, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the\u00a0Middle District of Pennsylvania announced that\u00a0nine military ballots were incorrectly discarded in Luzerne County. Seven of the nine\u00a0were found in a dumpster outside of their envelopes, all of which were marked as votes for\u00a0Trump.", "Luzerne County removed\u00a0the\u00a0temporary contractor who made the error while sorting ballots and cooperated with the FBI to recover the ballots from the dumpster, per County Manager C. David Pedri.", "Until the announcement from the Justice Department, Pedri wrote that he was unaware the ballots in question had been cast for Trump.", "He maintained that the system is safe.", "\u201cWhile the actions of this individual has cast a concern, the above statement shows that the system of checks and balances set forth in Pennsylvania elections works,\u201d Pedri wrote. \u201cAn error was made, a public servant discovered it and reported it to law enforcement at the local, State and Federal level who took over to ensure the integrity of the system in place.\u201d", "Fact check:Pennsylvania mail-in votes need 2 envelopes to be counted", "Based on our research, the claim that a\u00a0photo shows mail-in ballots cast for President Donald Trump discarded on the side of a road is FALSE. As for the remainder of the Facebook post, our research did not reveal discarded Trump ballots in California or Texas.\u00a0Seven discarded ballots for Trump were found in Pennsylvania after an error\u00a0by a temporary contractor, not the U.S. Postal Service.", "Thank you for supporting our journalism.
