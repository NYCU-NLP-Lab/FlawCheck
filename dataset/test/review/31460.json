Johnson was raped by a 20-year-old member of her church and became pregnant in Florida and learned very quickly that Christianity can be very cruel to its adherents.", "\u201cIt was forced on me,\u201d she told the Times. See, authorities had begun sniffing around because she was pregnant with a 20-year-old\u2019s child, so church official made the decision that the best way to avoid embarrassment was to marry her off to her rapist.", "The story was accompanied by a photograph of a young girl alongside a much older man.

Chris Christie [in May 2017] blocked the legislation. New York legislators are considering a bill backed by Gov.
