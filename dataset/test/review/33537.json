Voted in 2013 to make it illegal for any city in Florida to enact paid sick leave.\"", "The post, which we found posted elsewhere, states that Cruz also took two weeks\u2019 paid sick leave and \"voted in 2015 in the U.S. Senate against paid sick leave.\"", "We found that while the post gets the lawmakers\u2019 votes right, it makes a notable leap when it states that the men took paid sick leave.", "As members of Congress, they don\u2019t have to take sick leave but were able to work from home at their own discretion. It\u2019s a privilege that many working people don\u2019t have.", "Federal law does not require paid sick leave, but 12 states and Washington, D.C., have enacted laws to require it, and other cities have similar policies.", "This post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

Gaetz said he took a lab test and that it came back negative for COVID-19. Cruz announced his self-quarantine March 8. Cruz said he would continue his self-quarantine until March 17.

Gaetz \"voted in 2013 to make it illegal for any city in Florida to enact paid sick leave\" and Cruz \"voted in 2015 in the U.S. Senate against paid sick leave.\"", "The post correctly notes that Gaetz and Cruz have voted against paid sick leave.
