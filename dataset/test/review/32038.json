The post makes comparison references to purported immigration practices in several other countries and claims that people who cross the Australian border \"illegally\" are entitled to a range of generous benefits. It reads in part:", "\u201cIF YOU CROSS THE AUSTRALIAN BORDER ILLEGALLY, YOU GET:\u00a0\n\tA JOB, A DRIVERS LICENSE, HEALTH CARE CARD, WELFARE, FOOD VOUCHERS, $70,000 GRANT, RENT ASSISTANCE, FREE HEALTH CARE, FREE EDUCATION, A LOCAL MEMBER CHAMPIONING YOUR CAUSE, BILLIONS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF PUBLIC DOCUMENTS PRINTED IN YOUR LANGUAGE, THE RIGHT TO CARRY YOUR COUNTRY\u2019S FLAG WHILE YOU PROTEST YOU DON\u2019T GET ENOUGH RESPECT, A PLACE OF WORSHIP BUILT EXCLUSIVELY FOR YOUR RELIGION,\n\tI JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE I HAD A FIRM GRASP ON THE SITUATION !!!\n\tPLEASE KEEP THIS GOING.\n\tIT\u2019S TIME TO WAKE UP AUSTRALIA!!!!\u201d", "Below is a screenshot of the misleading post:", "Posts with similar claims have circulated on Facebook since at least 2018\u00a0here, here, here, here, here, here, and here.", "The claim is false; Australian immigrations laws and current\u00a0government policy ban anyone who\u00a0\"arrives in Australia illegally by boat\" from\u00a0settling in Australia.", "It is\u00a0against the law for non-citizens without a visa to enter Australia's migration zone under the 1958 Migration Act. Since 1992 under the Migration Amendment Act, non-citizens who are considered to have\u00a0entered the country illegally\u00a0have been subject to mandatory detention.", "The migration zone is defined in the Migration Act as \"the area consisting of the States, the Territories, Australian resource installations and Australian sea installations.\"", "\u201cThe Australian Government\u2019s policy is very clear \u2013 anyone who arrives in Australia illegally by boat will never settle in Australia,\u201d a Home Office spokesperson told AFP via email on November 21. \u201cAnyone who arrives illegally will immediately be returned to their home country or transferred to a third country for regional processing.\u201d", "In an effort to curb arrivals by sea, the government under former prime minister Julia Gillard passed amendments which resumed Australia's offshore processing program in Nauru and Papua New Guinea in August 2012.", "The policy meant that people who entered Australia without a visa would be transferred to Nauru and Papua New Guinea for processing. This resumed the policy -- dubbed the 'Pacific Solution' -- which stopped with the transfer of refugees from Nauru to Australia in 2008.", "In July 2013, the government of former prime minister Kevin Rudd\u00a0announced the Australia and Papua New Guinea Regional Settlement Arrangement, which allowed asylum seekers with legitimate claims to potentially resettle in Papua New Guinea. The arrangement also meant that those who attempted to enter Australia prior to processing would be barred from ever settling in Australia.", "\u201cAs of today asylum seekers who come here by boat without a visa will never be settled in Australia,\u201d Rudd said when announcing the agreement.", "The Australian government also signed similar arrangements for processing\u00a0migrants abroad with Nauru in August 2013.", "Arrangements were also signed with\u00a0Cambodia in September 2014 and the United States in November 2016, but only for resettlement of people they deemed to be legitimate asylum seekers.", "The program, however, has been criticised. In 2018, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees\u00a0said\u00a0\u201ccircumstances and conditions for refugees under Australia\u2019s \u2018offshore processing\u2019 policy have had severely negative impacts on health, and particularly significantly mental health.\u201d", "Comparable misleading immigration claims have also been shared in the United States. Fact-checking website Snopes, for instance, debunked a similar claim regarding illegal immgration here.", "CORRECTION:\u00a0this post was updated 3/12/2019 to correct the timeline and government responsible\u00a0for the reintroduction of Australia's offshore processing program.", "UPDATE: this post was updated 2/12/2019 to clarify the wording used to describe Australia's immigration policy.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
