["About this rating", "In early 2017 courts in the U.S. ruled against President Trump's proposals (issued via executive order) to temporarily ban travel from six Muslim majority countries (Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen), saying the plan improperly targeted religion. After a 3 June 2017 attack in London that killed seven people and left several dozen others injured, President Trump took to Twitter to call for prompt U.S. Supreme Court (SCOTUS) review of his \"watered down Travel Ban\":", "The Justice Dept. should ask for an expedited hearing of the watered down Travel Ban before the Supreme Court - & seek much tougher version!", "\u2014 Donald J.

Not only did the court overturn the lower court\u2019s decision on the ban, it also restored the order to its original glory, banning terrorists from 7 countries and allowing President Trump \u201call of the authority granted a President in matters of immigration.\u201d", "The ruling makes significant changes to the way things are going to be done at airports. No longer will you have to be inconveniently pulled out of line at random because we have to search the same number of regular people as we do Muslims. Agents at the airport will be able to profile how they see fit. Without the influx of refugees applying for asylum at the airport, since they simply won\u2019t be coming here. the TSA can work on rooting out the people who want to do us harm who already live here.", "There was no truth to this report at the time it was published. As of June 2017, the Supreme Court had yet to rule on the ban. However, the high court did narrow the scope of previous stays on the ban in a 26 June 2017 unsigned opinion which said that the ban would be in effect for residents from those nations who lacked a \"bona fide relationship with any person or entity in the United States.\" The court said that foreign nationals could enter the U.S. to \"live with or visit a family member.\" Other exceptions to the ban would include students admitted to a U.S.-based university, lecturers heading into the country for an appearance, or someone moving to the US after accepting a job offer. The court also said that it would hear arguments regarding the issue in October.", "This report originated with America's Last Line of Defense, a fake news site whose a disclaimer notes that they are a \"satirical publication\" created to \"present fiction as fact,\" and that their \"sources don\u2019t actually exist.\"", "Stryker. \u00a0 \"BREAKING: Supreme Court Rules on Travel Ban.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 America's Last Line of Defense. \u00a0 5 June 2017.", "Chung, Andrew and Hurley, Lawrence. \"Supreme Court Breathes New Life into Trump's Travel Ban.\" Reuters. 27 June 2017.", "Updated with note on Supreme Court ruling in June 2017.", "David Mikkelson founded the site now known as snopes.com back in 1994.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
