["About this rating", "Shortly after the deaths of music icons\u00a0David Bowie, Lemmy, and Glenn Frey, a rumor started circulating that Rolling Stones' guitarist Keith Richards had passed away.", "This untrue rumor stemmed from a misunderstanding of two literary components: reading comprehension and satire. On 13 January 2016, an\u00a0entertainment web site called the\u00a0Nevada County Scooper\u00a0published a fake news article claiming that Keith Richards had not\u00a0been found dead:", "Keith Richards Found Not Dead in San Francisco Hotel", "\u201cWith a very heavy heart, I am sad to announce that sometime early this morning, Rolling Stones guitarist, Keith Richards was found still alive.\u201d said\u00a0 Ms. D\u2019lune choking back tears, \u201cHe was found in his suite, sitting in a chair, watching Jamie Oliver reruns on the tele. Emergency personnel were summoned and exhaustive attempts were made to revive him, but since Mr. Richards was not dead, that was deemed unnecessary.\u201d", "The Nevada County Scooper\u00a0penned the above-quoted article in a manner reminiscent of a news story reporting on the death of a celebrity. While the entertainment site never wrote that Richards had been found dead, the manner in which the above-quoted article was written fooled some people into believing that the iconic guitarist had passed away.", "The above-quoted article is a work of fiction. While\u00a0the\u00a0Nevada County Scooper correctly (although confusedly) wrote that Keith Richards had not passed away, the story about medics being called to the hotel only to be surprised by a\u00a0living, breathing\u00a0musician is completely made up.", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
