["About this rating", "In early 2019, the United States suffered its worst series of measles outbreaks since 1994. Between 1 January 2019 and 26 April 2019, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 704 individual cases of measles had been confirmed in 22 states. \u201cThis is the greatest number of cases reported in the U.S. since 1994 and since measles was declared eliminated in 2000,\u201d the organization reported.", "Dubious websites and citation-free social media posts have attempted to suggest that these measles outbreaks are the result of immigrants who illegally crossed into the U.S. via the Southern border \u2014 a common but almost-always-false trope employed by those who oppose more open immigration policies. For example, pro-conspiracy, anti-vaccine website Natural News claimed on 28 April 2019 that, \u201cIt\u2019s the disease-ridden illegal aliens that are bringing infectious diseases into America\u201d in a story titled in part, \"The Measles Outbreak is a Massive False Flag.\" That report cited a story from Alex Jones' Infowars that misrepresented a Fox News segment about a measles outbreak in New York.", "In keeping with this theme, on 29 April 2019, in response to a tweet claiming \"The GOP brought Measles back,\" former GOP congressman and radio personality Joe Walsh tweeted: \u201cIf you truly wanted to keep terrible diseases from overtaking our population, you'd secure the border and get a handle on illegal immigration.\u201d", "No factual basis exists to support the claim that illegal immigrants are the cause of the increase in U.S. measles outbreaks. But multiple pieces of evidence do support the claim that unvaccinated people who have traveled to areas with high rates of measles and then returned to the U.S. are the cause of the uptick. As of 30 April 2019, measles outbreaks \u2014 defined by the CDC as three or more simultaneous cases in the same area \u2014 were identified in nine geographic areas:", "The epidemiology of many of these outbreaks has been researched by the CDC, which concluded that \u201cthese outbreaks are linked to travelers who brought measles back from other countries such as Israel, Ukraine, and the Philippines, where large measles outbreaks are occurring.\u201d", "The cases in New York State\u2019s Rockland County and New York City, for example, have been tied to an unvaccinated Orthodox Jewish child who picked up measles on a trip to Israel, and who then spread it among the largely unvaccinated community to which that child returned. As reported by New York City\u2019s Health website:", "As of April 29, 2019, there have been 423 confirmed cases of measles in Brooklyn and Queens since October. Most of these cases have involved members of the Orthodox Jewish community. The initial child with measles was unvaccinated and acquired measles on a visit to Israel, where a large outbreak of the disease is occurring. Since then, there have been additional people from Brooklyn and Queens who were unvaccinated and acquired measles while in Israel. People who did not travel were also infected in Brooklyn or Rockland County.", "This New York measles outbreak, comprising 423 of the 704 individual infections, represents the vast majority of cases that are part of this troubling resurgence of measles in 2019. It was caused not by illegal immigration across the Southern border, but by unvaccinated American citizens traveling abroad in Israel \u2014 a country that is currently having its own measles epidemic. Similarly, the outbreaks in California have been tied to four cases of people traveling abroad and returning to the United States:", "In 2019, four outbreaks linked to patients with international travel have been reported in California. As of April 24, 2019, 38 confirmed measles cases, including 28 outbreak-associated cases, have been reported.", "As argued in Vox, \u201cHad these travelers and their families been vaccinated, we wouldn\u2019t have measles here. And when you couple the ease of opting out of vaccines with the fact that there\u2019s a greater global risk of catching measles elsewhere, it\u2019s not hard to see why the disease is now roaring back.\u201d Those who attempt to tie the rise to Southern-border-crossing immigrants do so by ignoring the epidemiological realities of a world that sees one billion people cross international borders every year, sometimes into and out of countries with low vaccination rates or ongoing outbreaks.", "Israel currently is experiencing a measles outbreak that vastly outpaces that experienced in the U.S. in 2019. As reported in the Daily Beast, Israel has seen diagnosed cases of measles \u201csoar from about 30 in the year 2017-2018 to almost 4,000 in the year 2018-2019.\u201d Ukraine, another country listed as a source of measles exposure to unvaccinated Americans, also is experiencing an unprecedented outbreak of measles. That country\u2019s acting minister of health told Science that the rise is caused by \u201ca decade of corruption, war, a lack of political commitment to vaccination, and antivaccine sentiment.\u201d The Ukraine saw more than 15,000 cases and seven deaths in between 28 December 2018 and 1 February 2019.", "The Philippines, the third country indicated by the CDC as a source of contact for international travelers who could carry measles to the U.S., is also experiencing a massive outbreak. As of 26 February 2019, \u201cover 12,700 measles cases [were] officially reported by DOH [Department of Health] with 203 deaths from 1 January to 23 February 2019.\u201d According to that country's health department, \u201cthe Philippines has seen a decline in the first dose of measles vaccine in the past decade \u2014 from above 80% in 2008 to below 70% in 2017. Initial figures for 2018 indicate further decrease.\u201d For herd immunity to kick in and protect people from measles at a population level, the number of those vaccinated needs to approach 95%.", "Conversely, the countries of origin from which immigrants are attempting to cross the Southern border have comparatively high vaccination rates and are currently not experiencing large scale outbreaks of measles. As we reported in a 2018 iteration of this claim, many of the countries in Central America from which the migrants are attempting to flee have higher vaccination rates for measles than does the United States. In 2017, 92% of children aged 12-23 months were vaccinated for measles in the United States. In Mexico and Honduras, that figure was higher, at 96% and 97% respectively. El Salvador and Guatemala have seen a recent decline in vaccination rates, with 85% and 86% coverage in 2017 \u2014 the most recent year for which World Bank data is available.", "Claims that measles outbreaks in the U.S. are caused by Southern-border immigration are therefore wholly unsupported by factual evidence or hard data. To claim otherwise, one must ignore the actual data that links these measles outbreaks to specific unvaccinated Americans traveling abroad in measles-prone regions. For both of these reasons, the claim is false.", "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \u00a0 \u201cMeasles Cases in 2019.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Accessed 30 April 2019.", "Adams, Mike. \u00a0 \u201cThe Measles Outbreak Is a Massive False Flag; Nearly All Outbreaks Are Caused by Infected Migrants, Not American Children.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Natural News. \u00a0 28 April 2019.", "NYC Health. \u00a0 \u201cMeasles: Recent Outbreak in Brooklyn and Queens.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Accessed 30 April 2019.", "Belluz, Julia. \u00a0 \u201cThe Explosive US Measles Outbreak, Explained.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Vox. \u00a0 30 April 2019.", "Belluz, Julia. \u00a0 \u201c2019 Is Shaping up to Be a Very Bad Year for Measles\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Vox. \u00a0 15 April 2019.", "Carter, Eric D. \u00a0 \u201cWhen Outbreaks Go Global: Migration and Public Health in a Time of Zika.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Migration Policy Institute. \u00a0 7 July 2016.", "Tarnopolsky, Noga. \u00a0 \u201cIsrael Saw 4,000 Measles Cases in 2018\u2014and Only 30 the Year Before.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Daily Beast. \u00a0 2 April 2018.", "Waldman, Meredith. \u00a0 \u201cMeasles Cases Have Tripled in Europe, Fueled by Ukrainian Outbreak.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Science. \u00a0 12 February 2018.", "World Health Organization. \u00a0 \u201cQuestions and Answers on the Measles Outbreak in the Philippines.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 26 February 2019.", "Vaccines.gov. \u00a0 \u201cVaccines Protect Your Community.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Accessed 30 April 2019.", "World Bank Data. \u00a0 \u201cImmunization, Measles (% of Children Ages 12-23 Months).\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Accessed 30 April 2019.", "Alex Kasprak is an investigative journalist and science writer reporting on scientific misinformation, online fraud, and financial crime.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
