Scott Walker sought to close the door on opponent Tom Barrett\u2019s claim that Wisconsin lost jobs in 2011, as monthly surveys of businesses have shown.\n\nHis administration had drawn criticism in mid May from Democrats for rushing out much more favorable jobs numbers -- part of a more detailed census of businesses -- before federal labor officials could sign off on them.\n\nIn the May 31, 2012 debate, Walker stressed that those federal officials had now completed their review of the more comprehensive data -- and confirmed that Wisconsin not only hadn\u2019t lost jobs in Walker\u2019s first year, but gained even more than state officials thought.\n\n\"Yesterday the US Bureau of Labor Statistics \u2026 sent an email to the state\u2019s Workforce Development department saying they\u2019ve reviewed and verified the numbers,\" Walker said, adding the agency had put the job gain at 23,608, a bit larger than Walker\u2019s preliminary number from mid-May.\n\nBarrett pounced, saying that a U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics official was quoted in the Journal Sentinel as saying the numbers were not in fact final.\n\nSo who\u2019s right?\n\nBLS officials could clear this up, but they have chosen to stick with their policy of not commenting on any individual state\u2019s data before they post the numbers for all 50 states on the federal agency\u2019s website in late June 2012 -- weeks after the recall election.\n\nThey repeated to us what they have said to other reporters: They have completed their review but can\u2019t say anything about the quality of the numbers.\n\n\"BLS approved the submission of Wisconsin data as part of the normal processing of data, but does not comment on data until released by BLS,\" the agency\u2019s chief spokesman, Gary Steinberg, said in an email.\n\nThe Walker administration has released a cryptic email chain with federal and state officials that it says confirms that federal officials are OK with the numbers crunched by Walker\u2019s administration. Walker cited this in the debate.\n\nThe emails are not easy to interpret.\n\nThe emails\u2019 reference to the quarterly census of jobs is the number \"202,\" a federal designation for the census. BLS officials in the email chain are with the BLS\u2019s \"Current Data Analysis\" section, or CDA.\n\nOne of the emails tells state officials: \"As discussed, CDA has declared the data for the BLS publication to be preliminarily clean.\"\n\nIn another, a BLS-to-BLS exchange, the message is: \"CDA has declared final signoff.\"\n\nNotably, the emails do not spell out what numbers they are signing off on.\n\nSteinberg, of BLS, made clear that \"any state may release its data when ready and does not need to wait for BLS to release data.\"\n\nFor instance, Minnesota also has released its quarterly census data and -- similar to Wisconsin -- the data shows a much larger job gain than the monthly estimates.\n\nMinnesota released its data only after BLS reviewed and verified it. Wisconsin, by contrast, put its numbers out -- and Walker immediately put them in campaign TV ads -- before BLS had verified them.\n\nOur rating\n\nWalker said the federal government had signed off on the positive jobs numbers and provided some information that supports Walker\u2019s claim.\n\nBut his statement leaves out the fact federal officials publicly will not verify the numbers, and the fact that the emails released do not contain any numbers, let alone the ones cited.\n\nThose missing, important details land his claim at Half True.", "(You can comment on this item on the Journal Sentinel's website).", "Email and phone interview with John Dipko, communications director, Wisconsin Workforce Development department, June 1, 2012\n\nEmail and phone interview with Ciara Matthews, Walker campaign spokesperson, June 1, 2012\n\nPhone interview with Steve Hine, labor market information director, Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development, June 1, 2012\n\nEmail exchange with Gary Steinberg, spokesperson, US Bureau of Labor Statistics, June 1, 2012\n\nPhone interview with Stacey Standish, BLS spokesperson, June 1, 2012\n\nMilwaukee Journal Sentinel, \"Walker speeds release of positive jobs data,\" May 15, 2012\n\nMilwaukee Journal Sentinel, \"Disputed state survey shows April job loss,\" May 17, 2012\n\nMilwaukee Journal Sentinel, \"Walker official says feds have verified his jobs numbers,\" May 30, 2012\n\nThe Associated Press, \"Scott Walker administration: Feds approve higher Wisconsin jobs numbers,\" June 1, 2012", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
