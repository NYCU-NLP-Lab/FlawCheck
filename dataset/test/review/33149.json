But it did have a plan: rely on the states.", "\"The federal plan, much like the rest of the federal response to the coronavirus pandemic, was very hands off when it comes to details of implementing public health interventions,\" said Josh Michaud, associate director of global health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation. \"The last mile of vaccine delivery was not a big part of the federal plan by design.\"", "We asked Michael R. Fraser, CEO of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, if the Trump administration had a plan for vaccine distribution.", "\"It is all in what you mean by \u2018plan,\" Fraser said. \"If you mean a tactical guidebook on how to do vaccination from A to Z, no, there is no federal plan.\"", "Prakash Nagarkatti, vice president for research at the University of South Carolina, told USA Today that \"there was total lack of planning at the state level for mass vaccination, and the federal government did not help the states overcome the hurdles.\"", "In September, the Trump administration announced a general strategy to distribute the vaccine which included deliveries to states and, later, pharmacy chains.

It wasn\u2019t until December that Congress approved a COVID-19 package with $8 billion for vaccine distribution.", "At the same time, it\u2019s clear there was some level of coordination.

About 44 million doses had been distributed.", "The main challenge that states now face is they only know how many doses they are getting a few days in advance.
