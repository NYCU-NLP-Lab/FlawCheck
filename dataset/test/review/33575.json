["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on June 25, 2019", "Social media posts misidentify a woman in an old photo with President Donald Trump. She is not E.

The couple operated a beauty pageant with which Trump had partnered.", "Harth was one of several women who publicly\u00a0accused Trump of inappropriate behavior during the 2016 election.", "Harth also recently weighed in on Carroll\u2019s story, writing on Twitter that \u201cwhat happened to her was almost verbatim to what happened to me at Mar A Lago in 1993.\u201d", "Carroll described Trump\u2019s alleged assault, which she says took place in fall 1995 or spring 1996 in a Bergdorf Goodman dressing room in New York City, in an upcoming book.
