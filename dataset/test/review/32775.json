["About this rating", "The photographs are genuine.", "The makeup of the substance is unknown.", "On Nov. 19, 2020, U.S. President Donald Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, who was hired by Trump's reelection campaign to file legal challenges to the results of the 2020 election, gave a conspiracy theory-laden news conference alleging widespread voter fraud. While Giuliani urged viewers to take his evidence-free claims seriously (BBC's Americas Bureau Chief Paul Danahar called it the \"most unsubstantiated diatribe\" he had ever witnessed), much of the conversation on social media dealt with some odd images of New York City's former mayor that reportedly showed dark streaks of hair dye running down his face:", "This is a genuine photograph of Giuliani during his news conference that was taken by Tom Williams. The image is available via Getty Images along with the caption:", "UNITED STATES - NOVEMBER 19: Rudolph Giuliani, attorney for President Donald Trump, conducts a news conference at the Republican National Committee, on lawsuits regarding the outcome of the 2020 presidential election on Thursday, November 19, 2020.

The following photo, for example, was taken by Sarah Silbiger of The Washington Post:", "WASHINGTON, UNITED STATES - NOV 19: Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, lawyer for U.S. President Donald Trump, speaks during a news conference about lawsuits related to the presidential election results at the Republican National Committee headquarters in Washington, D.C., on Thursday Nov. 19, 2020. (Photo by Sarah Silbiger for The Washington Post via Getty Images)", "While these photographs are undoubtedly real, there is some debate over what caused the dark streaks down Giuliani's face. While most social media users presumed that it was melted hair dye, some hair care experts disagreed.", "David Kholdorov of the Men\u2019s Lounge Barbershop and Spa on Manhattan\u2019s Upper East Side told The New York Times: \"Hair dye doesn\u2019t drip like that, unless it\u2019s just been applied.\"", "Mirko Vergani, the creative color director at the Drawing Room, said that the streaks may have been caused by mascara that was applied to the sideburns: \"Sideburns are more gray than the rest of the head ... You can apply mascara to touch the gray side up a bit so it looks more natural.\"", "Slate also launched an investigation into the strange streaks With the help of Nicole Wingo from Washington D.C.\u2019s Barber of Hell\u2019s Bottom, they concluded that it was likely some sort of pomade with a semi-permanent coloring effect:", "WINGO: The hair journey that these guys are on is definitely a wild one. I think something like that is probably the result of a tinted product. I wouldn\u2019t think that that was a demi-permanent or semi-permanent color. I would think it\u2019s a topical product, like a pomade or a tinted gel that got really \u2026 gooey.", "SLATE: So this is not a product you\u2019re familiar with or use with your clients? Would this be the kind of thing you\u2019d buy at the drug store?", "WINGO: This is not something that I\u2019ve seen on my clients. The only products I can think of that offer a color payoff in addition to a styling component are gray products that you see at the drugstore or darker gels or pomades.

I would guess that something like this is the $8 to $15 range.", "While Giuliani's streaks stole the show at this news conference, the event also gave reporters plenty to discuss. For instance, Giuliani, at one point, invoked a character with notoriously bad eyesight from the movie \"My Cousin Vinny\" to make a point about observing poll watchers from an appropriate distance.\u00a0 As for the rest of Giuliani's news conference, Fox News reporter Kristin Fisher said that most of what Trump's personal lawyer alleged was \"simply not true\":", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
