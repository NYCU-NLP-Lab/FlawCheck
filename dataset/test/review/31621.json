Still, Andy Brown\u2019s claim in a mailer stopped us short: \"Travis County now has the highest urban county tax rate in Texas.\"", "Brown, an Austin lawyer running for Travis County judge, aired his statement under an arrow suggesting county tax bills steadily escalated while his Democratic primary opponent, Sarah Eckhardt, served on the Travis County Commissioners Court.", "We\u2019re focusing here on whether the county has the highest tax rate of the state\u2019s urban counties.", "By email, Brown\u2019s campaign manager, Jim Wick, told us the campaign compared the 2012 total tax rate for Travis County with the rate in other counties that are home to the state\u2019s five largest cities. Wick included a chart indicating that in this subset, the Travis County rate of $0.5001 per $100 property valuation exceeded the rates in Harris, Dallas, Tarrant, Bexar and El Paso counties. El Paso County, Brown\u2019s chart indicates, had the next-highest rate, $0.40887 per $100 valuation.", "\"Since there is no statutory definition of an urban county, we defined it as a county that has a \u2018big city\u2019 in it that is often compared to other big cities around Texas,\" Wick wrote.

Among the 15 most populous counties, the chart and our own web research suggested that in 2012 and 2013, Travis County had the second-highest total property tax rate--topped only by Hidalgo County, which is home to McAllen near the Texas-Mexico border. Hidalgo County\u2019s rate of $0.59 per $100 valuation in 2012 and 2013 compared with Travis County\u2019s respective rates of $0.5001 and $0.4946 per $100 valuation.
