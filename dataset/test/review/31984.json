["By Lori Robertson", "Posted on January 14, 2020", "Democratic presidential candidate Mike Bloomberg charged in a TV ad that President Donald Trump had \u201cbroken\u201d a \u201cpromise\u201d to protect those with preexisting health conditions. Trump fired back on Twitter, \u201cI was the person who saved Pre-Existing Conditions.\u201d In fact, Trump backed Republican plans that would have weakened the protections in the Affordable Care Act.", "Bloomberg\u2019s ad began airing on Jan. 11 in TV markets across the country, with a nearly $6 million ad buy in just four days, according to Advertising Analytics.", "The TV spot begins with a video clip of Trump saying, \u201cThose preexisting conditions are protected.\u201d An announcer then says: \u201cA broken promise. Trump repeatedly tried to undermine coverage for 134 million Americans with preexisting conditions.\u201d That figure is an Obama administration high-end estimate for those with existing medical conditions, regardless of their type of health coverage. But the ACA protections primarily affect the individual market, where just\u00a06% of the population\u00a0gets coverage.", "The video of the president appears to be from a July 19, 2017, lunch with members of Congress in which Trump discussed improving a Senate Republican bill, introduced about a week prior, to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. Trump said a GOP plan would include, \u201cStabilizing exchanges, so that those preexisting conditions are protected.\u201d But the Republican bills at the time \u2014 and one introduced two months later \u2014 would have provided fewer protections than the ACA.", "As we have explained before, insurers can\u2019t deny coverage or charge more based on health status under the ACA. Those provisions of the law have primarily affected the individual market, where those without insurance through an employer or a government program such as Medicaid buy their own policies. Before the ACA, premiums on the individual market were often set based on health status, and coverage could be denied entirely, as Georgetown University\u2019s Center on Health Insurance Reforms explains.", "The GOP bills debated in 2017 did include some of the ACA protections, but not all of them. In particular, the Republican plans could have caused some with medical conditions to pay higher premiums:", "For more on the Republican plans, see our story \u201cThe Facts on the GOP Health Care Bills.\u201d", "At the time the Graham-Cassidy bill was under consideration, Trump claimed on Twitter: \u201cI would not sign Graham-Cassidy if it did not include coverage of pre-existing conditions. It does!\u201d But that ignored the fact that insurers could have priced policies based on health status in states that allowed it.", "Trump, in his Jan. 13 tweet, accused Bloomberg of \u201cFalse Advertising,\u201d adding, \u201cI was the person who saved Pre-Existing Conditions in your Healthcare, you have it now, while at the same time winning the fight to rid you of the expensive, unfair and very unpopular Individual\u00a0 Mandate.\u201d", "We\u2019re not sure how Trump can argue he \u201csaved\u201d preexisting conditions, when the failed Republican bills he supported would have weakened the ACA protections. We reached out to the White House press office about the claim but have not received a response.", "In the second of a two-tweet thread on preexisting conditions, the president also mentioned Republican actions \u201cin court,\u201d an apparent reference to a lawsuit his administration has backed that argues the ACA is unconstitutional. In 2012, the Supreme Court had ruled the individual mandate, or requirement to have insurance, was constitutional under Congress\u2019 power to tax. But in late 2017, the Republican tax law eliminated the fee associated with that mandate. The plaintiffs in the Texas suit argue that without any monetary penalty, the mandate, and the entire law, should fall.", "We don\u2019t know what actions the administration would take on preexisting conditions if the ACA is ultimately struck down, but a 2018 letter from then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions said that two provisions of the law would need to be eliminated if the suit were successful: those guaranteeing that people can\u2019t be denied coverage by insurers or charged more based on certain factors.", "The case, Texas v. United States, is likely headed to the Supreme Court, though it\u2019s unclear when the high court would rule on it, as a Health Affairs blog post on the case explains.", "In December, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a district court decision that the individual mandate was unconstitutional, but sent the case back to the district court for \u201cadditional analysis\u201d on whether the mandate provision was severable from the rest of the law. In other words, the court will examine whether the rest of the law could stand even if the mandate was unconstitutional.", "The Democratic attorneys general and governors, along with the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives, defending the ACA in the case have asked the Supreme Court to hear an appeal on an expedited basis. The Trump administration has said the lower courts should resolve the severability issue first.", "The Bloomberg ad says that \u201cTrump repeatedly tried to undermine coverage for 134 million Americans with preexisting conditions.\u201d But that\u2019s a\u00a0high-end\u00a0estimate for all Americans who have a preexisting condition \u2013\u00a0not those who would be immediately affected if the Supreme Court strikes down the ACA.", "If the ACA\u2019s protections were eliminated, 61 million to 133 million people\u00a0could be \u201cdenied coverage, charged significantly higher premiums, subjected to an extended waiting period, or having their health insurance benefits curtailed\u00a0should they need individual market health insurance coverage,\u201d\u00a0emphasis is ours,\u00a0according to a\u00a0Jan. 5, 2017, report\u00a0by the Obama administration\u2019s Department of Health and Human Services.", "The lower number is an estimate for those with a condition that, before the ACA, generally would have led to a denial of coverage on the individual market, and the higher number, which is 51% of the nonelderly population, includes those who could have been denied coverage, charged more or faced some coverage exclusions.", "The ACA\u2019s protections \u2014 and the GOP proposed modifications \u2014 primarily affect those seeking individual-market health coverage, and it\u2019s highly unlikely everyone with these health conditions, including asthma and arthritis, would seek such coverage. Only 6% of the population gets coverage on the individual market, while 49% have work-based insurance, the same percentage as in 2010, when the ACA was enacted.", "However, the ACA did institute some new protections for those with employer-based plans, as we\u2019ve explained before. Pre-ACA, employer plans couldn\u2019t deny coverage to workers, but they could decline coverage for some preexisting conditions for a limited period \u2014 if a new employee had a lapse in insurance coverage.", "Some experts\u00a0have\u00a0said that the House GOP bill in 2017 also would have affected employer plans by allowing states to determine the essential health benefits that insurers currently have to cover. Those essential health benefits include 10 services: ambulatory, emergency, hospitalization, maternity and newborn care, mental health and substance use disorder services, prescription drugs, rehabilitative services and devices, laboratory services, preventive care and chronic disease management, and pediatric services including dental and vision.", "Under the ACA, regardless of preexisting conditions, employer plans can\u2019t put annual or lifetime limits on coverage of essential health benefits, and a cap on out-of-pocket spending for policyholders is also based on those benefits.", "But the Obama administration report focuses on the impact on the individual market, where coverage could be denied or priced higher based on health status without the ACA.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
