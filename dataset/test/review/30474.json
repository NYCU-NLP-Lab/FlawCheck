["By Eugene Kiely", "Posted on May 13, 2016", "In a floor speech, Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid made some wildly exaggerated claims about\u00a0Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s endorsement of\u00a0presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump:", "Reid made his remarks on the Senate floor on the day that Trump was in Washington to meet with Ryan. The likely Republican standard-bearer later met with McConnell.", "Reid, May 12: Since Senator McConnell is so enthusiastically embracing Trump, you can only assume he agrees with Trump\u2019s view that women are dogs and pigs. You can only assume that the Republicans\u2019 leader is not repulsed by Trump\u2019s behavior towards women.", "First some background: The Senate Democrats have already begun to use guilt by association to tie all Republican Senate candidates to Trump\u2019s policies and statements. The Hill reported in March\u00a0on a Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee Web video that \u201cintersperses clips of some of Trump\u2019s incendiary remarks \u2014 with a lot of foul language bleeped out \u2014 with clips of incumbents and House members running for Senate saying they\u2019ll support Trump if he\u2019s the party\u2019s nominee.\u201d", "Now, let\u2019s look at what McConnell has said about Trump.", "McConnell endorsed his fellow Kentuckian, Sen. Rand Paul, for president, not Trump. After Paul dropped out, McConnell didn\u2019t endorse any of the other remaining candidates.", "When it became clear that Trump would be the nominee, McConnell announced in a statement on May 4 that he would support Trump. \u201cOn Wednesday evening, 24 hours after Trump won the Indiana primary and knocked out his remaining presidential contenders, McConnell released a tepid statement saying he would support the nominee,\u201d the Washington Post reported.", "Politico called it both \u201ctepid\u201d and \u201clukewarm,\u201d noting that McConnell issued a statement rather than holding a press conference.", "Politico, May 11: McConnell quietly laid out his rationale for offering a tepid endorsement in a news statement: He had long committed to supporting the nominee and Trump was now the guy. It didn\u2019t get a lot of buzz, and neither did his remarks Tuesday in which he offered facts rather than opinions, concluding that Trump \u201cgot more votes than anybody else.\u201d", "The Hill, in its story on the endorsement, also noted McConnell\u2019s backing was expected, despite his \u201cskepticism of Trump.\u201d The Hill wrote, \u201cWhile McConnell had made his skepticism of Trump clear throughout the raucous primary, he also always said he would back the eventual nominee.\u201d", "The Hill described some of the Senate leader\u2019s differences with Trump.", "The Hill, May 4:\u00a0In December, McConnell criticized Trump\u2019s proposal to temporarily ban foreign Muslims from entering the United States as \u201cinconsistent with American values.\u201d", "He admonished the front-runner earlier this year, urging him to condemn violence at his rallies after protesters were assaulted.", "He told Trump during a phone call in March \u201cthat I thought it would be a good idea for him no matter who starts these violent episodes to condemn it.\u201d", "McConnell clearly does not endorse everything that Trump has said or done, so Reid cannot \u201cassume he agrees with Trump\u2019s view that women are dogs and pigs.\u201d\u00a0(For more on what exactly Trump called some of his female adversaries \u2014 not all women \u2014 see our Aug. 11, 2015, story \u201cTrump\u2019s Amnesia.\u201d)", "Reid, of course, knows better. During his own reelection campaign in 2010, Reid criticized\u00a0President Obama when the president warned families about wasting money in Las Vegas casinos instead of saving for family expenses, such as college tuition. \u201cThe president needs to lay off Las Vegas and stop making it the poster child for where people shouldn\u2019t be spending their money,\u201d Reid said at the time.", "It is true that McConnell, whose primary focus\u00a0is maintaining control of the Senate, seemed cheered by Quinnipiac University polls\u00a0that showed Trump was doing well in three swing states where the Republicans are battling to hold on to Senate seats. CNN quoted McConnell as saying, \u201cIt looks to me like at the beginning of the race, Florida and Pennsylvania and Ohio look pretty competitive. It\u2019s a long time until November, but the early indications are that our nominee is likely to be very competitive.\u201d", "But Reid takes McConnell\u2019s hope that Trump is competitive in key swing states as a sign that the Republican leader is now \u201centhusiastically embracing\u201d Trump. Reid goes even further to assume this enthusiasm for Trump is because the likely nominee\u2019s policies are \u201cidentical\u00a0to the Republican Party platform.\u201d", "\u201cWhile speaking with reporters earlier this week, the Republican leader even sounded enthusiastic about Trump\u2019s chances in the general election,\u201d Reid said in his floor speech. \u201cI guess he should be giddy about a Trump presidency. Donald Trump is everything that the Republican leader and his party could ever want in a nominee. His policy positions are identical to the Republican Party platform.\u201d", "Trump\u2019s policy positions are not \u201cidentical to the Republican Party platform.\u201d", "The Washington Post\u00a0back in August\u00a0listed numerous instances\u00a0in which Trump has taken positions at odds with the 2012 Republican platform, and more recently so did the Daily Caller and the New York Times.", "Here are some examples where Trump\u2019s positions are at odds with the party platform:", "Trade: The 2012 platform\u00a0praises free trade agreements for creating \u201cnearly 10 million jobs,\u201d and called for implementing the\u00a0Trans-Pacific Partnership. In an op-ed, Trump has blamed trade pacts for costing millions of jobs and singled out the TPP as \u201cthe biggest betrayal in a long line of betrayals where politicians have sold out U.S. workers.\u201d", "Nuclear weapons: The party platform calls for \u201cpreventing the spread of those armaments,\u201d while Trump has said \u201cmaybe it\u2019s not so bad\u201d if Japan had a nuclear weapon, and South Korea too, to deter North Korea.", "Entitlement programs: As chairman of the House Budget Committee, Ryan repeatedly has proposed budgets that include significant changes to Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. The party platform agrees on the need for \u201cmajor structural reforms\u201d to entitlement programs to balance the budget. But Trump has criticized Ryan\u2018s\u00a0budget\u00a0proposals on entitlements as the reason why the Republicans lost the White House in 2012 when Ryan was on the ticket.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m not going to cut Social Security like every other Republican and I\u2019m not going to cut Medicare or Medicaid,\u201d Trump has vowed.", "Reid is no doubt eager to tie Senate Republicans to Trump, but in this instance the Democratic leader twisted the facts to do so.", "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/e14bbd26-0ea6-4c37-8d40-1974b1c8617d", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
