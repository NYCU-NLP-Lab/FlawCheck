["By Robert Farley", "Posted on April 29, 2020", "Defending his early response to the coronavirus pandemic, President Donald Trump wrongly claimed that in late February, Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, was saying, \u201cThis is no problem. This is going to blow over.\u201d", "In a Feb. 29 interview, Fauci said that \u201cright now at this moment\u201d the risk was \u201clow\u201d and there was \u201cno need\u201d for people \u201cto change anything that you\u2019re doing on a day-by-day basis.\u201d But he added that \u201cthis could change,\u201d that people needed to be wary of \u201ccommunity spread,\u201d and that it could develop into a \u201cmajor outbreak.\u201d", "Trump\u2019s comment came in response to a question about press reports that he ignored warnings about the growing threat of the coronavirus in more than a dozen classified intelligence briefings included in the President\u2019s Daily Brief in January and February.", "Reporter, April 28: Mr. President, can you clarify what your intelligence advisers were telling you back in January and February? Were you warned about what was happening with coronavirus and the threat to this country? Should there have been stronger warnings? What were you hearing every day?", "Trump: Yeah, yeah. Well, I think probably a lot more to the Democrats, because a month later, Nancy Pelosi was saying, \u201cLet\u2019s dance in the streets of Chinatown.\u201d You go back and you take a look at \u2014 even professionals, like Anthony [Fauci], were saying this is no problem. This is late in February: \u201cThis is no problem. This is going to blow \u2014 this is going to blow over.\u201d And they\u2019re professionals, and they\u2019re good professionals.", "Most people thought this was going to blow over. And if you can go \u2014 we did, I think, on January \u2014 toward the end of January, we did a ban with China. That was a very \u2014 I think you just said, a little while ago, that was a very important step. And then ultimately, we did a ban on Europe. That was very early in the process.", "Because if you take the ban and you look at it, I was badly criticized by Sleepy Joe Biden, by others. I was criticized horribly for \u2014 I mean, he called \u2014 he said all sorts of things. We won\u2019t even say it. And then he apologized because \u2014 two weeks ago, he put out a statement that I was right. We did a ban. \u2026 And many people \u2014 Democrats, professionals, probably Republicans \u2014 said that this would never happen, there\u2019d be nothing; no big problem. You saw that, I think, better than anybody, Deborah. This was after the ban. So, obviously, I took it very serious. I\u2019m not going be banning China from coming in if I didn\u2019t take it seriously. And I did that early.", "There are several misleading statements in this response:", "But here we\u2019ll focus on Trump\u2019s claim that in late February, \u201ceven professionals, like Anthony [Fauci], were saying this is no problem\u201d and \u201cthis is going to blow over.\u201d That\u2019s not what Fauci was saying at that time.", "This isn\u2019t the first time Trump has misleadingly cited Fauci\u2019s late February assessments of the virus.", "On April 12, Trump retweeted a post by DeAnna Lorraine \u2014 a recently defeated California Republican congressional candidate\u00a0\u2014 in which Lorraine claimed that \u201cFauci was telling people on February 29th that there was nothing to worry about and it posed no threat to the US public at large.\u201d She ended her post, \u201cTime to #FireFauci\u2026\u201d", "Sorry Fake News, it\u2019s all on tape. I banned China long before people spoke up. Thank you @OANN https://t.co/d40JQkUZg5", "\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 12, 2020", "In a Feb. 29 interview with Kristen Welker and Peter Alexander on NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d show, Fauci said the risk from COVID-19 \u201cis still low,\u201d and he said there was no need for people to change their daily routines \u201cat this moment.\u201d But he warned that could change if \u201cyou start to see community spread.\u201d", "Alexander, Feb. 29: So, Dr. Fauci, it\u2019s Saturday morning in America. People are waking up right now with real concerns about this. They want to go to malls and movies, maybe the gym as well. Should we be changing our habits and, if so, how?", "Fauci: No. Right now, at this moment, there\u2019s no need to change anything that you\u2019re doing on a day-by-day basis. Right now the risk is still low, but this could change. I\u2019ve said that many times even on this program. You\u2019ve got to watch out because although the risk is low now, you don\u2019t need to change anything you\u2019re doing. When you start to see community spread, this could change and force you to become much more attentive to doing things that would protect you from spread.", "Welker: Dr. Fauci, quickly, how does this all end?", "Fauci: You know, it ends if you \u2014 it depends on the nature of the outbreak. I mean, this could be a major outbreak. I hope not. Or it could be something that\u2019s reasonably well controlled. At the end of the day, this will ultimately go down. Hopefully we could protect the American public from any serious degree of morbidity or mortality. That\u2019s the reason why we\u2019ve got to do the things that we have in our plan.", "Fauci\u2019s comments came as concerns were just starting to emerge in the U.S. about \u201ccommunity spread,\u201d meaning that the \u201csource of infection is unknown,\u201d as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention explains, and the virus may have been transmitted person-to-person from someone in the U.S., rather than by exposure to an infected traveler who had brought it to the U.S.", "On Feb. 26, Nancy Messonnier, the director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said in a telebriefing that the CDC fully anticipated seeing community spread of the virus within U.S. borders.", "\u201cIt\u2019s not so much a question of if this will happen anymore,\u201d she said, \u201cbut rather more a question of exactly when this will happen and how many people in this country will have severe illness.\u201d", "On Feb. 28, Messonnier reported that there were three confirmed cases of person-to-person spread in the United States. She said that while \u201cthe immediate risk to the general American public remains low \u2026 [o]ur guidelines and advice are likely to be interim and subject to change as we learn more.\u201d", "At a press conference on Feb. 29, the afternoon after his \u201cToday\u201d show interview, Fauci reiterated that the country as a whole, at that time, \u201cstill remains at low risk. But when we say that, we want to underscore that this is an evolving situation.\u201d", "Fauci, Feb. 29: But as we say this, we need to prepare for further challenges. And we will have them. You will hear about additional cases that will be coming on. You should not be surprised by that, but to realize that that is something that is anticipated when you get community spread.", "So when you have cases throughout the world, the way we\u2019re seeing now \u2014 South Korea, Italy, Iran and places like that \u2014 the United States cannot be completely immune to that. The challenge is how we deal with it.", "It wasn\u2019t until two weeks later, on March 16, that Trump imposed social distancing guidelines.", "One could question whether Fauci was slow to publicly call on the federal government to enact those guidelines. But Fauci\u2019s comments in late February were far different from Trump\u2019s claim that Fauci said, \u201cThis is no problem. This is going to blow over.\u201d", "FactCheck.org does not accept advertising. We rely on grants and individual donations from people like you. Please consider a donation.

Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
