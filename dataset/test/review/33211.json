["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on September 5, 2019", "Viral social media posts wrongly suggest that President Donald Trump\u2019s three eldest children are citizens only because of birthright citizenship.", "President Donald Trump\u2019s first wife, Ivana, became a U.S. citizen in 1988 \u2014 years after the last of the couple\u2019s three children, Eric, was born in 1984.", "As the president has floated the idea of ending birthright citizenship for those born to parents in the U.S. illegally, social media users\u00a0have homed in on that fact as an alleged instance of hypocrisy by Trump.", "\u201cTrump\u2019s ex-wife Ivana wasn\u2019t an American citizen until 1988. She gave birth to Don Junior in 1977, Ivanka in 1981, and Eric in 1984. Let\u2019s cancel their birthright citizenship first,\u201d one such post reads.", "While the years in that post are correct, the implication is misleading.", "The post suggests the three Trumps, who were all born in New York City, are only citizens because of birthright citizenship \u2014 the constitutional right that grants citizenship to all those born in the U.S. But it fails to note that their father is a U.S. citizen \u2014 and was at the time they were born \u2014 which experts told us would still qualify Donald Jr., Ivanka and Eric for citizenship.", "\u201cThey are not only birthright citizens, they would also receive citizenship through their citizen father, automatically under statute, since their parents were legally married and the family has always resided in the U.S.,\u201d Rogers Smith, a political science professor at the University of Pennsylvania who studies constitutional law, told us via email. \u201cFor children born out of wedlock to U.S. citizen fathers and non-citizen mothers it\u2019s more complicated, though citizenship can be obtained if various residency requirements are met.\u201d", "Federal law spells out citizenship eligibility for children born to at least one U.S. citizen abroad. Smith said \u201cif birthright citizenship by place did not exist, then logically the statutes governing citizenship through the parent\u2019s citizenship would apply.\u201d", "The same logic would also apply to Barron Trump, the only child of Donald and Melania Trump. It is irrelevant that his mother was not a U.S. citizen at the time of his birth, because of his father was born in the U.S. The first lady, originally from Slovenia, reportedly obtained a green card in 2001 and has said she became U.S. citizen in July 2006, months after Barron was born in March 2006.", "Birthright citizenship is enshrined in the 14th Amendment, which was ratified in 1868 and states: \u201cAll persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.\u201d The U.S. government\u2019s long-standing interpretation has recognized that to be true regardless of the immigration status of the child\u2019s parents.", "Such claims about the Trump family have circulated since the 2016 presidential election, when Trump began talking about ending birthright citizenship for children born to parents in the country illegally. His campaign website called the policy the \u201cbiggest magnet for illegal immigration.\u201d", "In October 2018, Trump said in an interview with Axios that he was eyeing an executive order regarding birthright citizenship, and he\u00a0recently\u00a0made comments to reporters suggesting he is still considering action.", "Trump, Aug. 21: We\u2019re looking at that very seriously \u2014 birthright citizenship. Where you have a baby on our land \u2014 you walk over the border, have a baby. Congratulations, the baby is now a U.S. citizen.", "Trump has not specified how he would change birthright citizenship. Some proposals put forth by Republicans rest on the idea that at least one parent should have a connection to the U.S.", "One measure introduced by Republican Rep. Steve King of Iowa, for example, proposes making birthright citizenship contingent on one parent being \u201ca citizen or national of the United States; an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the United States whose residence is in the United States; or an alien performing active service in the armed forces.\u201d", "That proposal would apply to future births, but if Trump\u2019s children had been born under such a law, they would still qualify for birthright citizenship through their father.", "It\u2019s worth noting, also, that Ivana Trump would have had to provide documentation that she was in the country legally to become a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1988. Applicants for naturalization who are spouses of U.S. citizens are eligible\u00a0to apply for citizenship after living in the U.S. as a legal permanent resident, and being married for, three years. Ivana and Donald Trump married in 1977.", "As we\u2019ve written before, whether \u2014 or, more precisely, how \u2014 Trump could end birthright citizenship for immigrants in the U.S. illegally is the subject of debate. Many scholars say a constitutional amendment would be required because an executive order or a simple act by Congress would prompt legal challenges for the courts to decide.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
