That proposal hasn't sat well with some of Trump's supporters, however, who believe that the wall should be built without any deal on DACA.", "In January 2019, as a government shutdown over a funding dispute for President Trump's border wall stretched into its second week, an image graphic supposedly showing an 19-year-old DACA beneficiary named Hermilo Moralez and the young man he killed, 18-year-old Joshua Wilkerson, was spread again on social media.", "When this image was posted to \"The_Donald,\" a section of Reddit dedicated to President Trump's fans, it was shared with the caption: \"Fuck DACA!

This policy was initially announced in June 2012, nearly two years after Joshua Wilkerson's murder:", "On June 15, 2012, the Secretary of Homeland Security announced that certain people who came to the United States as children and meet several guidelines may request consideration of deferred action for a period of two years, subject to renewal. They are also eligible for work authorization. Deferred action is a use of prosecutorial discretion to defer removal action against an individual for a certain period of time. Deferred action does not provide lawful status.", "Hermilo Moralez could not have been a DACA beneficiary because that policy did not exist at the time of his arrest. And Moralez, who was sentenced to life in prison, would not have been eligible for DACA status after that policy was implemented, as it is not open to illegal immigrants who have been convicted of a felony or serious misdemeanors.", "Hesson, Ted. \u00a0 \"Is Fear of Immigrant Criminals Overblown?\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 ABC News. \u00a0 15 July 2013.", "Preston, Julia. \u00a0 \"Obama to Permit Young Migrants to Remain in U.S.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The New York Times. \u00a0 15 June 2012.", "Christian, Carol. \u00a0 \"21-Year-Old Immigrant Convicted in Beating Death of Former Pearland Classmate.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Houston Chronicle. \u00a0 29 January 2013.", "Hesson, Ted. \u00a0 \"Trump Ponders National Emergency to Build Border Wall.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Politico. \u00a0 7 January 2019.", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
