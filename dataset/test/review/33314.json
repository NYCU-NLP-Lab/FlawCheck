["By Robert Farley", "Posted on January 10, 2020", "House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has criticized President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to kill Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani as \u201cprovocative and disproportionate.\u201d But, contrary to the president\u2019s contention, she did not \u201cdefend\u201d Soleimani.", "In fact, we were not able to find any examples of Democrats who have defended or \u201cmourned\u201d the death of Iran\u2019s top military commander, despite such claims from several other Republicans.", "On Jan. 2, the Pentagon announced that, at Trump\u2019s direction, American troops used a drone and killed Soleimani, Iran\u2019s top security and intelligence commander, at Baghdad International Airport. The Pentagon statement said Soleimani \u201cwas actively developing plans to attack American diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout the region.\u201d", "The statement further noted that \u201cSoleimani and his Quds Force were responsible for the deaths of hundreds of American and coalition service members and the wounding of thousands more. He had orchestrated attacks on coalition bases in Iraq over the last several months \u2013 including the attack on December 27th \u2013 culminating in the death and wounding of additional American and Iraqi personnel. General Soleimani also approved the attacks on the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad that took place this week.\u201d", "In a press release put out that day, Pelosi warned that the strike \u201crisks provoking further dangerous escalation of violence.\u201d Pelosi also noted that the military action was taken without Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) against Iran and \u201cwithout the consultation of the Congress.\u201d", "But nowhere in the release did she \u201cdefend\u201d Soleimani, as Trump claimed in remarks to the press on Jan. 9.", "Trump, Jan. 9: You know what bothers me? When I see a Nancy Pelosi trying to defend this monster from Iran, who has killed so many people, who has so badly \u2014 I mean, so many people are walking around now without legs and without arms. Because he was the big roadside bomb guy. He was the one who would send them to Afghanistan. He would send him to Iraq. He was big. That was his favorite thing. He thought it was wonderful. He doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s wonderful anymore. When Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats want to defend him, I think that\u2019s a very bad thing for this country. I think that\u2019s a big losing argument, politically, too.", "Those comments echo similar statements made by other prominent Republicans.", "In an interview with Sean Hannity on Fox News on Jan. 6, former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley said, \u201cThe only ones mourning the loss of Soleimani are our Democrat leadership and Democrat presidential candidates.\u201d And in an interview with Fox News\u2019 Lou Dobbs on Jan. 8, Rep. Doug Collins, the ranking Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, said, Pelosi and the Democrats are \u201cin love with terrorists\u201d and \u201cmourn Soleimani more than they mourn our Gold Star families who are the ones who suffered under Soleimani.\u201d (Two days later, Collins apologized for his remarks.)", "Again, we are not aware that Pelosi or any other Democratic leaders or presidential candidates publicly \u201cmourned\u201d the death of Soleimani or defended him. Our colleagues at PolitiFact looked into Haley\u2019s comment and found that while most of the Democratic presidential candidates expressed concern about Trump\u2019s move escalating tensions with Iran, they prefaced their comments by saying that Soleimani had the blood of American soldiers on his hands, and should not be mourned.", "We asked the White House when Pelosi defended Soleimani, but it did not respond.", "Several times in the past week, Pelosi has made comments critical of Trump\u2019s actions. But she never defended Soleimani.", "Pelosi, in a Jan. 4 press release calling on the administration to brief Congress: \u201cThe Trump Administration\u2019s provocative, escalatory and disproportionate military engagement continues to put servicemembers, diplomats and citizens of America and our allies in danger.\u201d", "Pelosi, in a Jan. 5 \u201cDear Colleague\u201d letter: \u201cAs Members of Congress, our first responsibility is to keep the American people safe. For this reason, we are concerned that the Administration took this action without the consultation of Congress and without respect for Congress\u2019s war powers granted to it by the Constitution.\u201d", "Pelosi, in a Jan. 8 press release, after the administration\u2019s briefing: \u201cMembers of Congress have serious, urgent concerns about the Administration\u2019s decision to engage in hostilities against Iran and about its lack of strategy moving forward.\u00a0 Our concerns were not addressed by the President\u2019s insufficient War Powers Act notification and by the Administration\u2019s briefing today.\u201d", "The speaker elaborated on her position during a press conference on Jan. 9. She again said Trump \u201cconducted a provocative, disproportionate airstrike against Iran which endangered Americans and did so without consulting Congress.\u201d But she said she was aware of \u201cjust how bad Soleimani was.\u201d", "Pelosi, Jan. 9: And so what happened in the view of many of us is not a promotion of peace, but an escalation. Not that we have any confidence in the goodness \u2013 or the good intentions of Iran, and we certainly do not respect, and I from my intelligence background, know just how bad Soleimani was. It\u2019s not because we expect good things from them, but we expect great things from us.", "Later in the press conference, Pelosi described Soleimani as \u201ca terrible person\u201d who \u201cdid bad things.\u201d", "Pelosi, Jan. 9: As I say, we have no illusions about Iran, no illusions about Soleimani, who was a terrible person. Did bad things. But it\u2019s not about how bad they are, it\u2019s about how good we are, protecting the people in a way that prevents war and does not have us producing, again and again, generations of veterans who are suffering.", "Trump\u2019s comments occurred about the same time that Pelosi spoke, and we don\u2019t know if Trump heard her remarks when he made his. But House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy responded directly to Pelosi\u2019s remarks and parroted Trump\u2019s claim that she was \u201cdefending\u201d Soleimani.", "McCarthy, Jan. 9: I never thought there would be a moment in time that the Speaker of the House of Representatives would actually be defending Soleimani. \u2026 Did you listen to what the Speaker just said? \u201cSoleimani was a bad person, but\u2026\u201d There is no \u201cbut.\u201d He\u2019s a bad person because he killed American soldiers. \u2026 He\u2019s a bad person because he was planning more against Americans. The president was right in his actions, and we are safer today for it.", "Later that afternoon on the House floor, Pelosi again argued that Trump\u2019s actions \u201cendangered our servicemen and women, our diplomats and others,\u201d but added that Soleimani \u201cwas somebody that we do not mourn the loss of.\u201d", "Pelosi, Jan. 9: But with the President\u2019s actions last week, he endangered our servicemen and women, our diplomats and others by taking a serious risk of escalation with tensions with Iran. This does not come with any respect for Iran. We know what bad actors they are in the world. We know that Soleimani, I from my Intelligence background, know that Soleimani was somebody that we do not mourn the loss of, a bad \u2013 he did very evil things in the world. But, we also know that when we take an action, we have to understand the ramifications of it.", "We take no position on whether the president\u2019s actions to take out Soleimani will ultimately make Americans more or less safe. But there is a distinction between criticizing the president\u2019s decision to kill Soleimani and \u201cdefending\u201d him, and there is no evidence that Pelosi defended Soleimani or \u201cmourned\u201d his death. In fact, she has made statements directly contradicting that claim.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
