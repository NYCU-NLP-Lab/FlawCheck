["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "Congress cleared the way for Georgia to transform Savannah\u2019s harbor into the port of the future way back in 1999. Then old-fashioned Mother Nature had her say.\n\nPlanners found that deepening the port to fit modern megaships will destroy some of the delicate wetlands nearby. More than a decade later, they\u2019re still mulling over what to do about it.\n\nThe Georgia Ports Authority, which is behind the dredging, thinks there\u2019s little doubt planners can make it work. Executive Director Curtis Foltz wrote in an op-ed that appeared in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that it\u2019s time to push ahead.\n\n\"The study of the Savannah River Estuary \u2014 the most comprehensive in history \u2014 clearly demonstrates the project can be constructed and impacts will be mitigated,\" Foltz said.\n\nThis claim puzzled the Truth-O-Meter team. If a study \"clearly demonstrates\" that port dredgers can address the environmental concerns, what\u2019s the holdup?\n\nThe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is the federal agency in charge of studying improvements to harbors and their effects. The agency wrote the study Foltz mentioned.\n\nThe port is next door to the Savannah National Wildlife Refuge, which is home to 10 threatened or endangered species, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Dredging will affect the Savannah River estuary, a type of habitat where fresh water mixes with salty ocean water. A number of species can\u2019t reproduce without estuaries.\n\nThe corps\u2019 \"Tier II Environmental Impact Statement for the Savannah Harbor Expansion\" was released in draft form for public comment in November 2010, \u00a0and details how port planners aim to ease the damage to the environment that dredging will cause.\n\nThe heads of several federal departments must sign off on the corps\u2019 assessment before the dredging begins, and they haven\u2019t done so yet.\n\nWe found that while the corps is optimistic that it can mitigate the impacts of the dredging, other arms of the federal government and an independent analysis found weaknesses in the plan. \u00a0\n\nFor the sake of simplicity, we\u2019ll focus on two of the most heavily contested issues in this debate: preserving the endangered shortnose sturgeon, and dealing with the loss of the waterway\u2019s dissolved oxygen, which fish and other marine life need to survive. \u00a0\n\nThe endangered shortnose sturgeon is a 3-foot-long fish with a bony plate of armor and an upturned nose. Dredging the port will destroy a significant percentage of its habitat, according to the environmental impact study, so the corps proposed to expand it by building a \"fishway.\"\n\nThis passage would connect shortnose sturgeon to other portions of the river where they can thrive. A dam currently blocks the route. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe corps\u2019 draft environmental study concluded that the impacts on the fish \"will be mitigated,\" but the National Marine Fisheries Service raised objections to the corps two months after the draft\u2019s release.\n\nAs designed, the proposed passage was \"not likely to be successful in passing sturgeon to justify its use\" to make up for habitat destruction, according to a letter the Fisheries Service sent to the corps. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe two agencies worked out changes to the fishway. Last month, the Fisheries Service said the corps\u2019 plan is \"not likely to jeopardize\" the shortnose sturgeon and other species, so long as the corps closely monitors the effort and meets other conditions.\n\nNow, on to dissolved oxygen, which is what fish breathe by filtering water through their gills. Researchers expect the port\u2019s expansion to lower the amount of dissolved oxygen in crucial parts of the harbor, so the corps proposed that they install equipment that will put oxygen back in. \u00a0\n\nThe National Marine Fisheries Service objected in a January letter to the corps. They said the equipment might not provide enough oxygen, and called it a \"very risky operation with a high degree of uncertainty.\"\n\nBut after a few months of discussion, they sent a letter in November saying that they think the corps plan will adequately protect the fish. This letter included plans to closely monitor oxygen levels and make immediate changes if problems arise.\n\nThe U.S. Department of the Interior\u2019s Fish and Wildlife Service also acknowledged that researchers disagree over whether the oxygen system will work. They told PolitiFact Georgia in a recent statement that they\u2019re working on a plan to monitor the equipment when it\u2019s installed to ensure it\u2019s effective.\n\nIn February, a nonprofit group hired by the federal government to review the corps\u2019 plans raised a different critique. The group said the oxygen injection system might release too much into certain areas of the harbor. This could have \"lethal impacts\" to fish, especially threatened and endangered species, the group\u2019s report said. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nNone of these comments said the problems are impossible to fix. They do question whether the corps plan will fall short of its goal.\n\nWe think it\u2019s fair to say that while the corps\u2019 environmental report may have concluded that dredgers can mitigate the environmental problems they would cause, as Foltz stated, critiques by other federal agencies and an independent study muddy the waters.\n\nFoltz should have acknowledged their reservations.
