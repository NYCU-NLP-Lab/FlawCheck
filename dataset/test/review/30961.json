Now he\u2019s shifting ... entirely because of optics.\"", "PunditFact wanted to know if Kristol is correct about Obama\u2019s evolution on government spying programs.", "Obama in the Senate", "In his early years in the Senate, Obama was a reliable critic of the post-Sept. 11 surveillance efforts launched by President George W. Bush.", "In 2005, the New York Times exposed a Bush executive order allowing the National Security Agency to tap Americans\u2019 international phone calls and emails in effort to track terrorists without seeking search warrants from the courts. The Times reported the agency was still seeking warrants for monitoring domestic communications.", "As the Senate voted to reauthorize the Patriot Act that same week, Obama decried the administration\u2019s \"fishing expedition\" of Americans\u2019 everyday electronic records in a floor speech: \"This is just plain wrong. ... Giving law enforcement the tools they need to investigate suspicious activity is one thing \u2013 and it\u2019s the right thing \u2013 but doing it without any real oversight seriously jeopardizes the rights of all Americans and the ideals America stands for.\"", "In a 2006 speech explaining why he would vote against confirming Michael Hayden as the director of the Central Intelligence Agency in 2006, Obama said:", "\"We don\u2019t expect the president to give the American people every detail about a classified surveillance program. But we do expect him to place such a program within the rule of law, and to allow members of the other two co-equal branches of government \u2014 Congress and the Judiciary \u2014 to have the ability to monitor and oversee such a program.\"", "And: \"We need to find a way forward to make sure that we can stop terrorists while protecting the privacy, and liberty, of innocent Americans. As a nation we have to find the right balance between privacy and security, between executive authority to face threats and uncontrolled power.

These are concrete safeguards to make sure surveillance hasn\u2019t gone too far.\"", "Obama as a candidate for president", "Fast forward to 2007.

No more national security letters to spy on citizens who are not suspected of a crime. No more tracking citizens who do nothing more than protest a misguided war.\"", "The next year, however, he faced charges of flip-flopping on warrantless wiretapping\u00a0by his Republican rival, Sen. John McCain.", "At issue was legislation in 2008 that rewrote the rules of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, the 1978 law that lays out rules for spying in the country and created a secret court of judges to oversee it.
