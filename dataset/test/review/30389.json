["White House aide David Simas made a claim about job growth under President Barack Obama during a March 18 appearance on CNN's 'New Day.'", "With the economy finally seeming to turn a corner, the Obama administration has been more aggressive recently about touting its accomplishments in creating jobs. But a claim made by one White House official recently was novel enough to catch our attention.", "The claim was made on CNN\u2019s New Day by David Simas, the assistant to the president and director of the White House\u2019s office of political strategy and outreach.", "\"We're more than happy to compare the record of this administration over the past six years that inherited the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression and is in the fifth year of record job creation, which is the fastest pace in this country's history,\" Simas told CNN\u2019s Alisyn Camerota.", "Is job growth at the \"fastest pace in this country's history\"? We took a closer look. We found that he actually had mangled his talking point: He meant to talk about how many months of consistent growth there\u2019s been, not how fast the pace is. We\u2019ll look at both metrics.", "Because the current recovery began 69 months ago, we looked at total job gains during the first 69 months of each of the previous recoveries, going back to World War II. (Employment data is not easily comparable further back than that.) We ignored the first dip of the double-dip recession in the early 1980s; we counted only from the end of the second dip.", "Here are the results:", "End month of recession", "Percent increase in nonfarm employment in first 69 months from end of recession", "October 1945", "25 percent", "October 1949", "18 percent", "May 1954", "11 percent", "April 1958", "12 percent", "February 1961", "21 percent", "November 1970", "13 percent", "March 1975", "18 percent", "November 1982", "19 percent", "March 1991", "11 percent", "November 2001", "5 percent", "June 2009", "8 percent", "This shows that far from being the \"fastest\" job growth in history, the pace of growth after the Great Recession was actually the second slowest out of these 11 time periods.", "\"I don't see any way to claim that the speed of growth in this recovery, even recently, is any kind of record,\" said Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist.", "Indeed, that's\u00a0how many Americans seem to feel about\u00a0the current recovery.", "\"Accounting for the severity of the recession, the speed of the jobs rebound was disappointing, especially in the first three or so years of the recovery,\" said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution.", "So what\u2019s going on?", "The White House told PolitiFact that Simas was referring to something else -- that the ongoing streak of 60 months of private-sector job growth is the longest on record.", "Here, the White House has a point. Sinclair agreed that the United States is currently enjoying the \"longest string of consistently positive monthly job growth since the payroll employment data we typically rely on began being reported in 1939. The late 1980s comes close, but there was a pesky one-month fall in employment in June 1986. Similarly, in the 1990s, there were a couple of small dips.\"", "Overall, it\u2019s the duration of this recovery -- rather than the rate of growth for job creation -- that has made it impressive.", "Our ruling", "Simas said job growth in the United States is now at the \"fastest pace in this country's history.\"", "He would have been right if he\u2019d stuck to the duration of the recovery: At 60 months and counting, it\u2019s the longest post-war recovery, though earlier recoveries would have been longer had brief blips not intruded. However, looking at how Simas phrased it on CNN, he\u2019s wrong: The current recovery actually ranks second-to-last among post-World War II recoveries when judged by the rate of growth in jobs. We rate the claim False.", "David Simas, interview on CNN\u2019s New Day, March 18, 2015", "Bureau of Labor Statistics, \"Employment, Hours, and Earnings from the Current Employment Statistics survey (National),\" accessed March\u00a018, 2015", "Email interview with Gary Burtless, senior fellow with the Brookings Institution, March 23, 2015", "Email interview with Tara Sinclair, George Washington University economist, March 23, 2015", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
