Bush, only 9 were transferred during the Obama administration.", "On 7 March 2017, President Trump used his personal Twitter account to tweet a criticism of his predecessor, President Barack Obama, for supposedly releasing 122 \"vicious\" prisoner from the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, who later \"returned to the battlefield\" and engaged in terrorist activities:", "122 vicious prisoners, released by the Obama Administration from Gitmo, have returned to the battlefield. Just another terrible decision!", "\u2014 Donald J.

Just another terrible decision!", "\u2014 President Trump (@POTUS) March 7, 2017", "President Trump's tweet was posted shortly after the airing of a segment on the \"Fox & Friends\" program about a former Gitmo detainee, Yasir al Silmi, who was killed during a 2 March 2017 U.S. raid in Yemen. \"Fox & Friends\", which correctly stated that al Silmi had been released under the administration of President Obama, ended the segment by noting that 122 detainees discharged from Guantanamo Bay had subsequently engaged in  terrorist activities.  But the \"Fox & Friends\" segment did not specify when those prisoners were set free, creating the mistaken impression among many viewers (including, apparently, President Trump) that all 122 of those prisoners had been released during the White House tenure of Barack Obama.", "Former Gitmo detainee killed by a U.S. airstrike in Yemen; at least 122 former Gitmo detainees have re-engaged in terrorism pic.twitter.com/y9jb420fFZ", "\u2014 FOX & friends (@foxandfriends) March 7, 2017", "According to a report from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, 122 detainees released from Guantanamo Bay had afterwards \"reengage[d] in terrorist or insurgent activities\" as of 15 July 2016. But of that total, 113 were transferred out of detainment at Guantanamo  prior to the January 2009 inauguration of Barack Obama \u2014 that is, under the administration of President George W. Bush:", "As the New York Times noted of this information, President Obama not only released a far smaller number of Guantanamo detainees, but a much smaller percentage of the Guantanamo prisoners transferred during his administration are \"confirmed or suspected of causing problems\":", "532 of the 693 former detainees who left the prison alive departed under Mr. Bush. That is because Mr. Bush decided in his second term that, as he wrote in his memoir, \u201cthe detention facility had become a propaganda tool for our enemies and a distraction for our allies,\u201d and he started trying to close it.", "But it is also true that in terms of percentages, Bush-era releases have been more likely to cause problems than Obama-era releases: About 35 percent of Bush-era transfers are confirmed or suspected of causing problems, while about 12 percent of Obama-era transfers fall into one of those two categories, according to the intelligence director\u2019s office.", "The difference is because the Bush administration struck diplomatic deals to repatriate large batches of prisoners to countries like Saudi Arabia and Afghanistan in bulk, and many recidivists come from those batches. By contrast, the Obama administration developed an individualized review process by six agencies to determine whether to recommend transferring each detainee. Over time, it also developed more careful diplomatic and monitoring plans with receiving countries to ease their reintegration into society that reduced, but obviously did not eliminate, the risk of recidivism.", "Shelbourne, Mallory. \u00a0 \"Trump Incorrectly Blames Obama for Release of 122 'Vicious' Gitmo Detainees.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The Hill. \u00a0 7 March 2017.", "Moore, Jack. \u00a0 \"U.S. Strike Kills Former Guantanamo Detainee in Yemen as Raids on Al-Qaeda Continue Under Trump.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Newsweek. \u00a0 7 March 2017.", "Director of National Intelligence. \u00a0 \"Summary of the Reengagement of Detainees Formerly Held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 14 September 2016.", "Savage, Charlie. \u00a0 \"Fact-Check: Trump Is Wrong About Guant\u00e1namo Detainees.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The New York Times. \u00a0 7 March 2017.", "Jacobs, Peter. \u00a0 Trump Blames Obama for 122 'Vicious' Guantanamo Prisoners returning 'to the Battlefield' ...\"\r\n \u00a0  \u00a0 Business Insider. \u00a0 7 March 2017.", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
