["By D'Angelo Gore, Robert Farley and Eugene Kiely", "Posted on October 26, 2018", "Editor\u2019s Note: For weeks, President Donald Trump has been campaigning in states that are key to the Republican Party\u2019s chances of maintaining control of the House and Senate. We have reviewed seven speeches he gave from Oct. 10 to Oct. 22. This is the second\u00a0in a series of stories on his speeches.", "President Donald Trump is proud of his economic record, and he points to some key economic indicators with great delight.", "Trump\u00a0inherited an economy experiencing growth in output, jobs and incomes, but since he has taken office, the stock market has continued to rise and set records \u2014 despite the recent declines. The jobless rate has dropped to the lowest in nearly half a century. Economic growth remained at a comparatively high 3.5 percent annual rate as of the most recent quarter, and the median household income in 2017 was the highest ever recorded.", "But Trump doesn\u2019t always stick to those facts out on the campaign trail when he talks to his supporters about his economic achievements as president.", "He often exaggerates jobs figures or seemingly makes them up. He also has a tendency to claim that U.S. companies are doing things they are not. And he never misses an opportunity to oversell the size and the benefits of the GOP tax bill he made law.", "Here are some examples of Trump going beyond the facts, or giving himself too much credit, during rallies over the last two weeks.", "Speaking in Richmond, Kentucky, on Oct. 13, the president said he was putting coal miners \u201cback to work like never before.\u201d As we wrote in \u201cTrump\u2019s Numbers,\u201d there has been an increase in coal mining jobs.\u00a0Since January 2017, the U.S. economy has added 1,900 coal jobs, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.", "But the increase is not \u201clike never before,\u201d as Trump said.", "During a similar 20-month time span, there were three times under President George W. Bush when more coal-mining jobs were created: from February 2001 through September 2002 (2,200 jobs), February 2005 through September 2006 (5,600 jobs) and February 2007 through September 2008 (6,100 jobs), according to BLS.", "And while there has been an increase in the number of coal mining jobs over the last two years, the total number of coal miners has not recovered to anywhere near the level it was just six years ago. According to BLS, there were 52,600 coal mining jobs in September. That\u2019s more than 40 percent fewer coal mining jobs than there were in early 2012.", "Although Trump implies that the coal industry is roaring back, the\u00a0outlook for coal miners isn\u2019t good. Earlier this month, the Energy Information Administration issued a report that projected U.S. coal production will decline 2 percent this year and next year. The EIA report says less demand for exports and increased use of natural gas to generate electricity will drive the decline in coal production.", "At several of his rallies, Trump has made the claim that \u201c[w]e\u2019ve added 600,000 new manufacturing jobs,\u201d which isn\u2019t accurate.", "Manufacturing jobs have increased under Trump, but the number rose by 378,000 between Trump\u2019s inauguration and September 2018, the most recent month for BLS data. There was a net decrease of 192,000 manufacturing jobs under President Obama, but following the recession, the number of manufacturing jobs has been generally rising since 2010.", "We\u2019re not sure how Trump gets 600,000 manufacturing jobs. Even counting from November 2016, when Trump was elected, there have been just 408,000 jobs added in that sector.", "As he did in Elko, Nevada, on Oct. 20, Trump has taken to making the pointless claim that \u201cmore Americans are working today than at any time in our history.\u201d", "Yes, there were 149.5 million total nonfarm employees as of September, which is the most of all time, according to BLS. But the U.S. also has a larger population than ever before, so Trump\u2019s claim doesn\u2019t mean much. By other (also imperfect) measures that factor in population, employment in the U.S. isn\u2019t at an all-time high.", "For those age 16 and over, the civilian labor force participation rate was 62.7 percent in September, and the employment-population ratio was 60.4 percent. Neither of those is the highest ever. Even the national unemployment rate, which was near a 50-year low of 3.7 percent in September, wasn\u2019t the lowest in history, according to BLS data.", "At multiple rallies, Trump made a version of the claim that \u201c[i]n less than two years, we have created over 4.2 million new jobs and lifted over 4 million Americans off of food stamps.\u201d", "Both figures are exaggerated. Total nonfarm employment\u00a0grew by 3.8 million\u00a0during the president\u2019s first 20 months in office, according to the most recent BLS figures available. That continued an\u00a0unbroken chain of nearly eight years of monthly gains\u00a0in total employment.\u00a0For context, the job growth in the 20 months before Trump took office, under Obama, was 4.2 million.", "And, as of July, the most recent month for which figures are available,\u00a038.9 million people\u00a0were receiving food aid through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, the lowest number since November 2009.\u00a0The number generally has been declining since peaking at nearly 47.8 million in December 2012, as the economy recovered from the Great Recession. That downward trend has continued under Trump, with the number of people receiving food aid down nearly 3.8 million, or 8.8 percent, between January 2017 and July 2018.\u00a0Over the previous 18-month time frame, the decline was 2.8 million.", "Trump, who this year imposed a 25 percent tariff on steel imports, also frequently talks about how well the steel industry is doing. He often mentions Pittsburgh-based U.S. Steel in particular.", "In Erie, Pennsylvania, on Oct. 10, Trump said: \u201cThe steel industry was dead and dying. One of the hottest industries right now in our country is American steel. U.S. Steel is opening and expanding seven different plants and spending a tremendous \u2014 billions of dollars doing it.\u201d", "But we still have not found any evidence that U.S. Steel is \u201copening and expanding seven different plants.\u201d", "Meghan Cox, a company spokeswoman, previously told us, \u201cAll of our operational changes have been publicly announced and all information shared with the federal government has been properly disclosed and made available on our website.\u201d There we found a September 2017 press release announcing the construction of a new continuous galvanizing line in Leipsic, Ohio, as well as press releases in March and June of this year about the restarting of operations at two blast furnaces and steel-making facilities at an existing plant in Granite City, Illinois. Then, in August, U.S. Steel announced a five-year plan to \u201cmodernize and enhance the company\u2019s flagship operation\u201d in Gary, Indiana.", "That doesn\u2019t add up to \u201cseven different plants,\u201d and since that time, there have been no additional announcements about new plant openings or expansions on the company\u2019s website.", "There\u2019s a phenomenon known in psychology circles as the illusory truth effect, which is the tendency for people to believe information that has been repeated to them many times. If that\u2019s the case, people who regularly listen to Trump\u2019s rallies may be under the misimpression that the Republican tax cut passed last year was \u201cthe biggest tax cut in the history of our country.\u201d", "Trump, Ohio, Oct. 12: Under Republican leadership, we passed the biggest package of tax cuts and reforms in American history.", "Trump, Kentucky, Oct. 13: We got tax cuts, biggest tax cuts in the history of our country.", "Trump, Arizona, Oct. 19: We gave you the biggest tax cut in the history of our country.", "Trump, Nevada, Oct. 20: And Republicans passed the biggest package of tax cuts and reforms in American history.", "The claim has been a staple of Trump\u2019s public speeches for months, but no matter how many times he says it, it still isn\u2019t true.", "As we have written\u00a0and written and written, there have been more expensive tax laws in terms of percentage of gross domestic product and inflation-adjusted dollars. The new tax law, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, would cost $1.46 trillion over 10 years,\u00a0according to the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation. The\u00a0Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget said\u00a0that an even more expensive plan previously proposed by Trump would have been only the eighth largest tax cut as a percentage of gross domestic product, and it would have been just the fourth largest cut in inflation-adjusted dollars.", "The largest tax cut in history, as a percentage of GDP, came under President Ronald Reagan in 1981, according to CRFB.", "In his boasts about the new tax law, Trump also has falsely claimed at multiple rallies that Republicans got rid of the estate tax.", "Trump, Arizona, Oct. 19: You know another thing we did for \u2014 I like a lot of people in Arizona, small businesses, farmers. You don\u2019t have estate tax. No more estate tax. So if you love your children \u2014 which is a question \u2014 you may not like \u2019em, in which case don\u2019t listen to me \u2014 if you don\u2019t like \u2019em, don\u2019t leave them the farm. But if you love \u2019em, you\u2019ll love Trump, because you don\u2019t have to pay estate tax, OK?", "Trump, Texas, Oct. 22: We\u2019ve saved your family farms, ranches, and small businesses from the estate tax, also known as the death tax. \u2026\u00a0 For those of you that really would like your small businesses, your farms, your ranches left to your children instead of now having your children go out when you kick the bucket, a sad day, and about two or three days later, they\u2019re happy as hell. No, forget it. Instead of have them \u2014 instead of having them go out and borrow a tremendous amount of money to pay the estate tax, they don\u2019t have to borrow anything. There\u2019s no tax. There\u2019s no tax.", "That\u2019s false. The new tax law doubled the threshold at which a family would be subject to the estate tax, but it didn\u2019t eliminate the tax.", "The new law doubles the exemption limit so that it now applies to estates with assets valued at less than $11.2 million ($22.4 million for couples). That provision expires at the end of 2025. So unless or until those new thresholds are extended by a future Congress, the exemption thresholds will revert to the prior levels.", "An analysis by the Tax Policy Center found that while the number of people who would have to pay an estate tax would drop from 5,500 to 1,700 in 2018, the tax revenues from the estate tax would drop by only about a third, from $20.4 billion to $13.6 billion.", "\u201cMost estate tax is paid by extremely wealthy people, so even doubling the exemption leaves most of it in place,\u201d Eric Toder, co-director of the Tax Policy Center, told us when the tax law was passed.", "It is also worth noting that very few farms were actually paying any estate tax before Trump signed the tax bill. A\u00a0study published by the Economic Research Service\u00a0of the U.S. Department of Agriculture estimated that 37,994 farms would become part of estates in 2017. And of those, only 0.8 percent \u2014 around 300 estates nationwide\u2014 would owe any estate tax at all.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
