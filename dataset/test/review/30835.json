["By Jessica McDonald and Eugene Kiely", "Posted on June 18, 2020", "In a meeting at the White House, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar left the misleading impression that the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s decision to revoke its emergency use authorization of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine for COVID-19 \u201cremoves a potential barrier\u201d and makes it easier to access the drugs. The FDA\u2019s action does the opposite.", "Following Azar\u2019s lead, President Donald Trump also falsely accused a journalist of asking a \u201cvery inaccurately stated question\u201d about the FDA\u2019s emergency use authorization, or\u00a0EUA, and continued to point to unscientific anecdotal evidence to insist that hydroxychloroquine is effective against COVID-19, despite growing evidence to the contrary.", "The FDA announced on June 15 that it had revoked its EUA for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine because the drugs are \u201cunlikely to be effective in treating COVID-19 for the authorized uses in the EUA,\u201d and that the \u201cknown and potential benefits\u201d of the drugs \u201cno longer outweigh\u201d the risks \u2014 which can include \u201cserious cardiac adverse events and other potential serious side effects.\u201d", "The FDA had issued the EUA back in March to allow adult and some adolescent patients hospitalized with COVID-19 to obtain the drugs from the Strategic National Stockpile \u201cwhen clinical trials are not available, or participation is not feasible.\u201d", "But accumulating evidence, including a large randomized controlled trial that the agency cited in its decision, has found that hydroxychloroquine does not help hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Other trials also indicate that the drug does not prevent the disease if given shortly after exposure to the coronavirus.", "The political spin began at a June 15 roundtable discussion at the White House when a journalist asked Trump to respond to news of the FDA\u2019s revocation. The reporter paraphrased the agency as saying the drugs were \u201cno longer considered reasonable as a useful treatment for COVID.\u201d", "Trump has misleadingly promoted hydroxychloroquine as a potential \u201cgame changer,\u201d despite its health risks and unproven use as a COVID-19 treatment.", "Azar said that the reporter\u2019s question was not \u201cquite accurate\u201d because the FDA\u2019s finding only applied to hospitalized patients. He then proceeded to suggest that revoking the EUA was a good thing because it removes a \u201csignificant misunderstanding\u201d that the drug could only be used in a hospital setting.", "The secretary stressed that the drug can still be prescribed for off-label use to treat COVID-19, saying the FDA\u2019s decision \u201cactually removes a potential barrier to that.\u201d", "Azar, June 15: At this point, hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are just like any other approved drug in the United States. They may be used in hospital, they may be used in out-patient, they may be used at home \u2014 all subject to a doctor\u2019s prescription. In fact, the FDA\u2019s removal of the emergency use authorization takes away what had been a significant misunderstanding by many that had made people think that somehow it could only be used in a hospital setting. And we\u2019ve tried to make that clear throughout.", "It\u2019s a drug. It\u2019s approved in the United States. Has been for decades. If a doctor wishes to prescribe it, working with a patient, they may prescribe it for any purpose that they wish to do so.\u00a0 And this actually removes a potential barrier to that.", "Trump: So it actually un-complicates it \u2014", "Azar: It does.", "Trump: \u2014 in a way. And I think that\u2019s probably \u2014 your question was a very inaccurately stated question.", "Reporter: No, I didn\u2019t mean to \u2014 I didn\u2019t mean to pose it inaccurately. I believe what it said specifically was that it\u2019s no longer reasonable to consider it an appropriate treatment.", "Azar: Only in the hospital. It said the data in the hospital setting was not supported. We continue to study in outpatient settings, as well as preventive. That data is not yet in.", "While it\u2019s true that the FDA\u2019s decision only pertains to hospitalized patients, the reporter\u2019s phrasing is very similar to that used in the agency\u2019s own revocation letter.", "\u201cFDA has concluded that, based on this new information and other information discussed in the attached memorandum, it is no longer reasonable to believe that oral formulations of HCQ and CQ may be effective in treating COVID-19, nor is it reasonable to believe that the known and potential benefits of these products outweigh their known and potential risks,\u201d wrote FDA Chief Scientist Denise M. Hinton.", "Rachel Sachs, a Washington University in St. Louis law professor, told us in a phone interview that the \u201creasonable\u201d language, which both the reporter and the FDA used, is part of the statute governing how the FDA can issue EUAs.", "\u201cOne of the things that the FDA has to find when it grants an EUA is that it\u2019s reasonable to believe that the drug in question is effective for the treatment of the condition,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so what the FDA is saying now is that based on the weight of the evidence, it\u2019s no longer reasonable to believe that hydroxychloroquine is effective for the treatment of COVID.\u201d", "In the\u00a0letter, the agency toggles between statements that are specific to hospitalized patients and others that are more general. For instance, the FDA says that upon a second review of the in vitro studies that first suggested chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine might have an ability to combat the coronavirus, it now believes the suggested doses \u201care unlikely to produce an antiviral effect.\u201d", "It also notes that the earlier studies that found the drugs might decrease the amount of virus patients shed \u201chave not been consistently replicated,\u201d and that a randomized controlled trial that more rigorously tested the idea found no difference between the proportion of those taking hydroxychloroquine and those getting the standard of care in\u00a0testing negative for the virus.", "That\u2019s in addition to national guidelines that now do not recommend the use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine in hospitalized COVID-19 patients outside of a clinical trial, including the National Institutes of Health\u00a0guidelines, which recommend against the use of the drugs outside of a trial.", "Several experts expressed bafflement that Azar \u2014 and then Trump \u2014 would object to the reporter\u2019s question.", "\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what the FDA said,\u201d said Dr. Neil Schluger, a pulmonologist and critical care specialist at Columbia University who has studied hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19. \u201cAzar\u2019s being very misleading in that statement.\u201d", "\u201cI thought the reporter\u2019s question was perfect,\u201d said Holly Fernandez Lynch, a professor of medical ethics at the University of Pennsylvania with expertise in FDA regulation. \u201cIf Azar was doing his job as a public health official, he wouldn\u2019t have chided the reporter for how he asked the question.\u201d", "Perhaps more critically, experts balked at Azar\u2019s suggestion that removing the EUA was lifting a \u201cpotential barrier\u201d on hydroxychloroquine\u2019s use, when in fact, the move reduces access to the drug by eliminating the option of getting it from the national stockpile.", "\u201cHe\u2019s somehow implying that the EUA made people think you could only use this to treat COVID-19 for hospitalized patients, and now that they\u2019ve removed the EUA, you could use it to treat COVID patients anywhere,\u201d Schluger said of hydroxychloroquine in a phone interview. \u201cIt\u2019s exactly the opposite of that.\u201d", "Azar is correct to say that because chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are FDA-approved to treat other conditions, including malaria \u2014 and in the case of hydroxychloroquine, rheumatoid diseases \u2014 they can be prescribed to COVID-19 patients in what\u2019s called off-label prescribing.", "But that has always been true. The EUA never changed that, and the revocation also does not change that.", "\u201cThe EUA had no impact on whether physicians could prescribe the drug off-label, whether patients could receive it off-label,\u201d said Sachs. \u201cIt just made it easier for hospital-based providers to obtain the drug from the stockpile and to administer it to their patients.\u201d", "It\u2019s useful to consider exactly what the initial EUA did in the first place. As Fernandez Lynch explained, the goal was to provide a supply of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine from the national stockpile, based on the limited evidence at the time that the drugs might work against the coronavirus.", "While chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are drugs that can be prescribed off-label, the specific chloroquine tablets donated to the stockpile were not actually FDA-approved for any use. On top of that, interstate commerce laws prevent distribution of drugs for unapproved uses, which meant that both drugs could not be legally dispensed from the national stockpile for COVID-19.", "To make that distribution legal, the FDA needed to issue an EUA, which the agency decided to limit to hospitalized patients outside of clinical trials.", "Azar\u2019s argument appears to be that that specification confused people, leading some to think that the drug more broadly could only be prescribed to hospitalized patients \u2014 and that by revoking the entire EUA, that restriction was lifted.", "But Sachs said that line of thinking doesn\u2019t hold water.", "\u201cI certainly have no evidence to support the claim that people believed hydroxychloroquine was only available in the hospital setting, and that now a barrier to its use was removed,\u201d she said. \u201cSec. Azar\u2019s framing sounds like what the FDA is doing is opening up hydroxychloroquine for broader use. But that\u2019s actually not what\u2019s going on \u2014 they\u2019re actually restricting one avenue for its use by withdrawing the EUA.\u201d", "Fernandez Lynch agreed, saying it was misleading for Azar to characterize the EUA revocation as a kind of easing on hydroxychloroquine.", "\u201cWhat they did was take away the EUA because the evidence no longer supported the EUA,\u201d she said in a phone interview, adding that it was irresponsible as a public health official not to relay the information that led the FDA to change its mind. \u201cInstead he went ahead and emphasized, do whatever you want under off-label prescribing \u2014 we\u2019re going to leave this up to you.\u201d", "Contrary to Azar\u2019s suggestion that the FDA was making it easier to get chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 outpatients, the agency already came forward in late April to caution against the use of both drugs outside of hospitals or a clinical trial.", "During the roundtable, Azar and Trump also gave misleading or incomplete descriptions of the evidence to date about hydroxychloroquine and COVID-19.", "As he has done in the past, the president \u2014 who has claimed to have taken hydroxychloroquine to prevent COVID-19 \u2014 said he has heard \u201csome great reports\u201d about the drugs and suggested without evidence that the hospitalized patients who received hydroxychloroquine were going to die anyway.", "Trump, June 15: The only place we don\u2019t get necessarily reports are coming out of Alex\u2019s agency or wherever they come from. I don\u2019t understand that, Alex. What is it exactly? Because I have heard \u2014 I\u2019ve had so many people that were so thrilled with the results from hydroxy. So, what is that exactly?", "Azar: Well, at your direction, we continue to study, especially in earlier phase \u2014 so a lot of the data that has come out that was more negative was people who were quite ill in the hospital.", "Trump: People that were, like, seriously ill. Like, they weren\u2019t going to make it. \u201cLet\u2019s give them a little hydroxy.\u201d And then they don\u2019t make it. And they say, \u201cOh, wow, maybe the president was wrong.\u201d All I know is that we\u2019ve had some tremendous reports. I\u2019ve had a lot of people tell me that they think it saved their lives.", "As Schluger previously told us, the majority of patients in several hydroxychloroquine studies survived, so it\u2019s not the case that hydroxychloroquine has only been given to deathly ill patients.", "It is true, however, that nearly all of the studies have been done in hospitalized patients.", "This includes a large randomized controlled trial in the U.K. called RECOVERY that the FDA cited in its EUA revocation decision. Although the full results have not been published, the trial reported on June 5 that hydroxychloroquine did not reduce the risk of death and also did not shorten the hospital stay or offer beneficial effects on other outcomes.", "According to a June 5 press release, 25.7% of the 1,542 hospitalized patients who received hydroxychloroquine died after 28 days, whereas 23.5% of the 3,132 patients who were given usual care died \u2014 a difference that was not statistically significant.", "The press release concluded that the results \u201cconvincingly rule out any meaningful mortality benefit of hydroxychloroquine in patients hospitalised with COVID-19.\u201d", "From that data, plus other smaller randomized controlled trials and other rigorously performed observational studies, which we have previously reviewed, it does not appear hydroxychloroquine offers any benefit to hospitalized COVID-19 patients.", "\u201cThe science is pretty straightforward on this,\u201d said Schluger. \u201cThe data tell a pretty consistent story.\u201d", "On June 17, the World Health Organization announced that given the initial findings from its own trial, the results of the RECOVERY trial and a review of the evidence, it was suspending the hydroxychloroquine arm of its Solidarity trial, which also was evaluating the drug in hospitalized patients.", "What is less clear \u2014 and where Trump and Azar may have a point \u2014 is that these results don\u2019t necessarily rule out that hydroxychloroquine might still have some effect in milder cases or for COVID-19 prevention.", "Some scientists do think it\u2019s plausible that hydroxychloroquine could still work in these instances \u2014 even if there isn\u2019t yet any evidence that it does.", "As Nicholas White, a professor of tropical medicine at the University of Oxford\u2019s Centre for Tropical Medicine and Global Health and Mahidol University in Thailand, told us in an email, it\u2019s \u201c[m]uch easier to prevent infections growing in the body\u201d than to get \u201crid of them once they have grown.\u201d", "He is helping to run a multinational randomized controlled trial with upwards of 40,000 participants to test whether chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine can prevent COVID-19 \u2014 and is concerned that some governmental decisions, including the FDA\u2019s memo, might make it harder to complete the trials that are necessary to definitively say whether the drugs work or not.", "The WHO, notably, also cautioned that its suspension decision should not apply to trials testing hydroxychloroquine\u2019s ability to prevent COVID-19 either before or after exposure, or what is called pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis.", "Still, Azar didn\u2019t give the whole story when he said that the \u201cdata is not yet in\u201d regarding the use of hydroxychloroquine to treat people outside of the hospital or for COVID-19 prevention. While many of these trials are in the works, at least one has reported results \u2014 and it, too, failed to identify an effect.", "The University of Minnesota published the first post-exposure prophylaxis randomized controlled trial of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 in the New England Journal of Medicine on June 3. In the double-blind trial, more than 800 volunteers were randomized to receive hydroxychloroquine or a placebo within four days of exposure to someone with confirmed COVID-19. Nearly 12% of hydroxychloroquine participants developed a COVID-19-like illness compared with 14.3% of those getting the placebo \u2014 a difference that was not significant.", "Some\u00a0scientists argue that more data is needed. They have critiqued the study because it did not confirm COVID-19 infection in the vast majority of people who were exposed and went on to develop the disease \u2014 an unavoidable problem, given the lack of testing availability at the time. Others, meanwhile, have found the results largely convincing.", "Schluger called it a \u201cpretty good study,\u201d adding, \u201cit\u2019s a pretty big study \u2014 821 patients \u2014 a randomized trial, so that\u2019s a very high standard of evidence.\u201d", "Science magazine reported on June 9 that another post-exposure prevention trial, run out of Barcelona, Spain, did not pick up a protective effect of hydroxychloroquine. The trial included more than 2,300 people who were exposed to the coronavirus and found there was no significant difference among those who received hydroxychloroquine versus the standard care in developing COVID-19. The study\u2019s lead investigator told Science that the results had been submitted for publication.", "University of Minnesota infectious disease specialist Dr. David Boulware, who led the first published prophylaxis trial, said no studies have reported results yet for pre-exposure prophylaxis. Those studies typically involve high-risk health care workers and have been slower to enroll volunteers.", "But he said the results of his university\u2019s trial of hydroxychloroquine in outpatients had been reported to the FDA.", "\u201cInvestigators from the University of Minnesota conducted a nationwide randomized clinical trial testing hydroxychloroquine for early outpatient treatment of COVID-19,\u201d he said in an email, adding that the drug was given within four days of the start of COVID-19 symptoms. \u201cThe trial\u2019s final results were shared with FDA on June 11, 2020 as well as with NIH, and the manuscript is presently undergoing scientific peer-review.\u201d", "\u201cThere are no positive data supporting hydroxychloroquine having a clinical benefit in humans with coronavirus,\u201d said Boulware in response to Azar\u2019s claim that a lot of the \u201cmore negative\u201d data was in very ill hospitalized patients. \u201cThe FDA is fully aware of what data do exist for earlier phase treatment.\u201d", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org does not accept advertising.
