Bush\u2019s funeral, put his hand over his heart as the casket passed.", "As former President George H.W. Bush\u2019s casket passed the first pew in the Washington National Cathedral during his funeral on Dec. 5, President Donald Trump put his hand over his heart.", "A moment later, Trump dropped his hand to his side while many of those near him \u2014 including Melania Trump, Barack and Michelle Obama, and Bill and Hillary Clinton \u2014 kept their hands over their hearts. It\u2019s that moment that has been widely shared online in memes expressing outrage that Trump didn\u2019t have his hand over his heart.", "Some of those pictures have a big red circle around Trump and some have an arrow pointing at him. Other pictures have circles around each person\u2019s hand to emphasize that Trump\u2019s hand is at his side.", "But no matter how they\u2019re presented, they\u2019re misleading. Trump did, indeed, have his hand over his heart when the casket passed by him as it was\u00a0entering\u00a0the cathedral, and when it was leaving, as can be seen in official White House photos.\u00a0Getty Images captured a nearly identical photo of Trump properly paying his respects at that point in the funeral.", "While it isn\u2019t a requirement, placing the hand over the heart is a sign of respect that is recommended as part of military funeral etiquette for civilians.", "This isn\u2019t the first time that the decorum of a public figure has been misrepresented through deceptive photo or video editing.", "Last year, conservative websites falsely accused Democratic leaders of remaining seated during a standing ovation for a Navy SEAL widow at Trump\u2019s joint address to Congress. There were two ovations and a video of the event shows Democratic leaders stood for both. However, they did not remain standing as long as Republicans \u2014 just as Trump did not keep his hand over his heart as long as others at Bush\u2019s funeral.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.", "Harrer, Andrew.
