Numerous readers contacted Snopes to investigate the legitimacy of such a claim, which was first reported by The New York Times on July 14, 2020.", "First, we searched for any evidence of the above-mentioned order by the Trump administration \u2014 that his administration announced a change for where on-the-ground health care staff send their observations on staffing and supply shortages, as well as data on testing, bed capacity in intensive care units, ventilators in use, and COVID-19 cases and deaths.", "We found a 13-page memo titled \"COVID-19 Guidance for Hospital Reporting and FAQs\" on the website of the U.S. Health and Human Services Department (HHS), of which the CDC is an arm, which was updated on July 10, 2020. Here's a summary of some of the document's main points:", "In other words, yes, the federal government in July 2020 \u2014\u00a0 as the country's number of coronavirus cases surpassed 3.4 million \u2014 modified the guidelines under which medical facilities report COVID-19 patient data and the pandemic's impact on them. Per the memo, the White House planned to rely on the centralized system \u2014 and that system alone \u2014 for how it would divvy up supplies such as personal protective gear and potential COVID-19 treatments going forward.", "In a special bulletin on July 13, 2020, the American Hospital Association, which represents thousands of medical systems nationwide, urged all hospitals to follow the new reporting guidelines and also stressed the federal government's announcement that they will be used for distributing resources.", "Next, we considered perhaps the most controversial aspect to the viral claim: that the change initiated by the Trump administration eliminated the CDC's previous role as overseer of COVID-19 hospital information. To that point, the memo explicitly reads:", "\"As of July 15, 2020, hospitals should no longer report the COVID-19 information in this document to the National Healthcare Safety Network site.\"", "HHS spokesman Michael R. Caputo elaborated in The New York Times' story, saying the CDC \"will certainly participate in this streamlined all-of-government response. They will simply no longer control it.\"", "The details of the CDC's new role were unclear as of this writing, and that alarmed public health officials, researchers, and critics of the Trump administration who believed the new system would give the federal government greater control over what Americans know \u2014 and don't know \u2014 about COVID-19's toll on communities.", "That group's concerns were largely related to unresolved questions over if, or to what extent, the HHS-run system would release the COVID-19 hospital data to the public like the CDC had done \u2014 and whether or not the HHS was going to report the hospitals' observations accurately. For instance, Thomas File, president of the Infections Diseases Society of America, said in a statement:", "Collecting and reporting public health data is a core function of the CDC, for which the agency has the necessary trained experts and infrastructure. Placing medical data collection outside of the leadership of public health experts could severely weaken the quality and availability of data, add an additional burden to already overwhelmed hospitals and add a new challenge to the U.S. pandemic response.", "Namely, critics of the reporting changes feared they would more easily allow the Trump administration to use COVID-19 data for its political gain, rather than in the best interests of Americans.", "Kate Starbird, an associate professor at the University of Washington who studies how social media is used to disseminate information during crisis events, said on Twitter:", "[The CDC losing its control of COVID-19 data collection] is going to feed the growing conspiracy theories and the related distrust in the government agencies that we need to help us get through this surging pandemic.", "In sum, considering the official memo on the website of the HHS that explicitly states that hospitals should no longer report COVID-19 data under a system managed by the CDC, as well comments by officials under the leadership of Trump in July 2020, we rate the claim this claim \"True.\"", "Beigel, John.\u00a0 \u00a0\"Remdesivir For The Treatment of Covid-19 \u2014 Preliminary Report.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0The New England Journal of Medicine.\u00a0 \u00a022 May 2020.", "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\u00a0 \u00a0\"Coronavirus Disease 2019.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a025 June 2020.", "Infectious Diseases Society of America.\u00a0 \u00a0\"Response from IDSA President to New COVID-19 Data Reporting Protocol.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a014 July 2020.", "American Hospital Association.\u00a0 \u00a0\"HHS Makes Significant Changes to COVID-19 Daily Data Reporting Process.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a013 July 2020.", "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\u00a0 \u00a0\"National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN).\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Accessed 15 July 2020.", "Stolberg, Sheryl Gay.\u00a0 \u00a0\"Trump Administration Strips C.D.C. of Control of Coronavirus Data.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0The New York Times.\u00a0 \u00a014 July 2020.", "U.S. Health and Human Services.\u00a0 \u00a0\"COVID-19 Guidance for Hospital Reporting and FAQs.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a010 July 2020.", "Sun, Lena and Goldstein, Amy.\u00a0 \u00a0\"Trump administration recommends the National Gaurd as an option to help hospitals report coronavirus data\".\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Washington Post.\u00a0 \u00a014 July 2020.", "Jessica Lee is Snopes' Senior Assignments Editor with expertise in investigative storytelling, media literacy advocacy and digital audience engagement.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
