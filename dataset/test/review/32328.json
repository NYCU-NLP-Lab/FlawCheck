Photo courtesy Santa Clara County Superior Court", "Brock Turner\u2019s brief jail term for sexual assault sparked outcry across California and the nation earlier this year.", "A judge sentenced the former Stanford University swimmer to just six months in jail even though Turner -- who had been convicted of sexually assaulting an unconscious woman -- faced a minimum two-year prison term, and prosecutors sought six years.", "On Sept. 2, Turner was released after serving half his jail term, for good behavior. Early release is standard practice in California\u2019s overflowing jails.", "Turner has since moved back to Ohio and registered as a sex offender.", "On the day Turner was released, opponents of a California ballot measure to reduce prison crowding seized on the notorious case to make a questionable claim.", "\"Brock Turner\u2019s early release will be a regular occurrence if Prop. 57 passes,\" claims the headline of a news release on the Stop57.com campaign website.", "Later in the press release, the campaign expanded on this claim saying Prop 57 \"would make reduced sentences and early release for persons convicted of the same sex crimes committed by Turner a permanent part of California law.\"", "We decided to fact check the bold claim in the headline, and to keep in mind the context included later in the press release.", "Opponents of\u00a0Prop 57 have\u00a0used the notorious Brock Turner case to argue against the ballot measure, including in this video.", "Our research", "Proposition 57 would allow thousands of prison inmates categorized by the state as \"nonviolent\" to be eligible for early parole. It\u2019s Gov. Jerry Brown\u2019s latest attempt to reform the state prison system.", "And it\u2019s led to heated debate over which offenders would be eligible for early release if it passes.", "But would the early release of sex offenders such as Turner really be \"a regular occurrence\" as the Stop 57 campaign claimed?", "Technically, no. Prop 57 applies to prison inmates -- not to those sentenced to jail like Turner.", "Still, we decided to examine the larger question raised by the claim of how prison inmates convicted of the same crimes as Turner would be affected.", "California's Proposition 57 is Gov. Jerry Brown's latest effort to reform the state's prison system.", "Background on Turner\u2019s case", "Turner was convicted on three felony counts: assault with intent to commit rape of an intoxicated or unconscious person, sexual penetration of an intoxicated person and sexual penetration of an unconscious person.", "Those crimes are considered nonviolent because, according to California law, they do not involve force.", "State law considers 23 crimes to be violent, obviously including murder and kidnapping. But in California, \"nonviolent\" is broadly defined.", "It applies to certain rapes and sexual assaults, such as Turner's conviction, along with vehicular and involuntary manslaughter, assault with a deadly weapon, domestic violence, exploding a bomb with intent to injure and other crimes.", "This remarkably broad definition for nonviolent crimes has made Prop 57 one of the most debated measures on November\u2019s ballot.", "Excluding sex offenders?", "Experts say there are valid questions about who would be eligible for parole. But Gabriel Chin, a criminal law professor at UC Davis, said the Stop 57 campaign stretched the truth by playing up the Turner case.", "\"It don\u2019t think it\u2019s accurate,\" Chin said of the claim. \"I certainly don\u2019t think it\u2019s likely that people convicted of sex offenses are going to get early release under this ballot initiative.\"", "Chin pointed to a 2014 federal court order that required the state to form guidelines to further ease California\u2019s prison crowding.", "Following that order, the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation created a process to allow some second-strike offenders to be considered for early parole. It excluded, however, those who must register as sex offenders.", "\"We see what the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation is doing: They\u2019re treating sex crimes as violent crimes. And I have no reason to imagine they would change that policy if Prop 57 passes,\" Chin said.", "Another view", "But just because it\u2019s become practice to exclude sex offenders for early parole consideration, doesn\u2019t mean that practice is codified in California law said Laurie Kubicek, a professor of criminal justice at Sacramento State University.", "\"I don\u2019t think the public should be lulled into believing that (an inmate given early release) would never be a sex offender,\" said Kubicek. \"I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what the law says. I think it could be a sex offender.\"", "She called the Stop 57 claim both \"true and false.\" She also noted the state is doing its best to keep risky offenders from becoming eligible for parole.", "We asked the Stop 57 campaign to explain its claim. It connected us with Merced County District Attorney Larry Morse, the campaign\u2019s co-chairman. Morse said because there\u2019s nothing specific in the ballot measure that deals with sex offenders, one must assume they will be eligible for parole.", "The Yes on 57 campaign, meanwhile, pointed to the state\u2019s current practice of excluding sex offenders from early release to say the claim at the center of this fact check was false.", "If 57 passes, the state must create additional regulations to further the goals of the ballot measure. Those rules must be certified by the state corrections agency, which anticipates \"that the regulations would \u2026 disqualify inmates who must register as sex offenders,\" an agency\u00a0spokesman told PolitiFact California in an email.", "The Stop 57 campaign added in another claim that, if Prop 57 passes, it will supersede existing state policies, and will force the state to make sex offenders eligible for early parole.", "Our ruling", "The Stop 57 campaign claimed \"Brock Turner\u2019s early release will be a regular occurrence if Prop. 57 passes.\"", "There are plenty of offenders who could be eligible for early parole under the ballot measure. California has a category of nonviolent offenders, many of whom committed heinous crimes and could be eligible for, though not guaranteed parole.", "Under its early release policy for second strike prisoners, however, the state corrections department excludes sex offenders from even being considered for early parole.", "That policy is not a state law. But the state corrections agency says it expects to continue this practice.", "The Stop 57 claim used the notorious Brock Turner case to argue that early parole \"will be\" a regular occurrence.", "At best, there\u2019s a remote chance the state will allow prisoners who committed the same crimes as Turner to someday be eligible for early parole.", "But past practice says it won\u2019t happen.", "We rate the claim Mostly False.", "MOSTLY FALSE\u00a0\u2013 The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.", "Click here for\u00a0more\u00a0on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/6a51672e-617f-4836-8dbe-8d75e964f765", "Stop 57.com, news release, Sept. 2, 2016.", "9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, Coleman, Plata order, Nov. 14, 2014", "California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, Report To The Three-Judge Court On The Court-Ordered Parole Process For Non-Violent, Non-Sex Registrant, Second-Strike Offenders Who Have Served 50 % Of Their Sentence, Dec. 1, 2014", "Associated Press, Swimmer's sex assault sentence spurs debate over prison plan, Sept. 2, 2016", "Voice of San Diego, Sacramento Report: The San Diego Split Over Prop. 57, July 22, 2016", "Sacramento Bee, \u2018Meet your new neighbor\u2019 cards paint extreme case of criminal release, August 19, 2016", "CNN, Why Brock Turner spent three months in jail, Sept. 2, 2016", "Interview, Gabriel Chin, criminal law professor, UC Davis School of Law, Sept. 23, 2016.", "Interview, \u00a0Laurie Kubicek, professor of criminal justice, Sacramento State University, Sept. 27, 2016.", "Interview, Larry Morse, Merced County District Attorney, Sept. 22, 2016.", "Interview, Dan Newman, spokesman, Yes on 57, Sept. 21, 2016.", "Interview, Jennifer Jacobs, spokeswoman, Stop 57, Sept. 21, 2016.", "Interview, Jeffrey Callison, spokesman, California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, Aug. 29, 2016.", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
