We don't know exactly when and where it was taken, or whom it pictures, but well before it was the subject of a \"Creepy stuff I made up\" tale it was posted online with a much more sensible explanation of depicting a boy having fun while accompanying his archaeologist father to work sites during summer vacations from school:", "My father was an archaeologist and every summer I went to the excavations.\n'Boy' with suspenders \u2014 it's me\nI miss that time.", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
