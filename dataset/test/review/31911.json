["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on February 12, 2020", "Q: Did House Speaker Nancy Pelosi break the law by ripping up the president\u2019s State of the Union address?", "A: Legal experts have widely dismissed the idea that Pelosi\u2019s copy of the address would be subject to a criminal statute cited by some conservatives.", "Did Nancy Pelosi tear up an official copy of the speech at the State of the Union Address?\u00a0 Is she liable for any legal penalty?", "While House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s supporters praised her decision to publicly rip up her copy of President Donald Trump\u2019s State of the Union address at the end of his Feb. 4 speech, conservatives lambasted the act, calling it \u201cpartisan\u201d and \u201cchildish.\u201d But some, including the president himself, went further by alleging that the act was illegal.", "\u201cFirst of all, it\u2019s an official document,\u201d Trump told reporters. \u201cYou\u2019re not allowed \u2014 it\u2019s illegal what she did.\u201d", "The claim that Pelosi violated federal law circulated widely on social media before Trump himself made the suggestion \u2014 it was advanced by Charlie Kirk, of the prominent conservative youth organization Turning Point USA, and by Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz, who called for an ethics investigation and said the act was \u201ca potential violation of law (18 USC 2071).\u201d", "Readers asked us about the claim and about a viral story circulating online with the headline, \u201cNancy Pelosi Fined $40K for Destruction of Government Property.\u201d That false story was first published on a website that calls its work \u201csatire.\u201d", "Legal experts have widely dismissed the notion that federal prosecutors would try to apply the criminal statute cited by Gaetz \u2014 which deals with \u201cconcealment, removal, or mutilation\u201d of federal records \u2014 to Pelosi\u2019s ripping up a copy of the speech.", "\u201cA saving grace of federal criminal law is that it\u2019s applied by prosecutors, judges, and juries with common sense,\u201d Daniel Richman, a law professor at Columbia Law School, told us. Richman, who previously served as chief appellate attorney in the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York and was a legal adviser for former FBI Director James Comey, added: \u201cThat approach makes it impossible to see the aggressive recycling of a non-unique document as anything more than that.\u201d", "Similarly, George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley, who served as an impeachment expert for House Republicans, concluded that it would not be considered a violation of the law.", "The specific statute in question refers to someone who \u201cwillfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, or destroys, or attempts to do so, or, with intent to do so takes and carries away any record, proceeding, map, book, paper, document, or other thing, filed or deposited with any clerk or officer of any\u00a0court of the United States, or in any public office, or with any judicial or public officer of the\u00a0United States.\u201d", "\u201cI am not convinced that this is a covered document. The law does not prevent the destruction of any government document in any form. If so, we would have nothing but warehouses from sea to sea,\u201d Turley wrote on his blog.", "Turley opined that the copy \u201cis a historic document worthy of preservation as one of two copies hand delivered by the President to the Vice President and the Speaker of the House of Representatives\u201d and that \u201cit should be preserved.\u201d But, he said, \u201cIt is a copy and a court would likely decline to read the law broadly to find a violation on the margins of the defined covered conduct.\u201d", "Another provision of the statute applies to the destruction of such records by those with \u201ccustody\u201d of the records \u2014 generally those considered having responsibility for their maintenance. Turley said Pelosi wouldn\u2019t be considered a \u201ccustodian\u201d of the copy she received.", "Some law professors also have argued that the First Amendment, or the U.S. Constitution\u2019s free speech or debate clause, could be further protection for Pelosi.", "It\u2019s worth noting that the National Archives and Records Administration will preserve a copy of the speech \u2014 from the White House.", "\u201cThe National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) preserves and provides access to the permanent records of Federal Agencies and the President in accordance with laws and regulations that govern the disposition of those records,\u201d the agency said in a statement. \u201cNARA will receive the President\u2019s version for preservation as a permanent record in accordance with the Presidential Records Act.\u201d", "NARA also said that while it \u201cholds the historical records of the House and Senate, those records remain the legal property of the respective Chambers \u2026 [t]he rules governing those records are not determined by federal laws or overseen by NARA, but rather by each Chamber\u2019s agreed upon rules.\u201d The agency said it \u201cdoes not have information about the record status of Speaker Pelosi\u2019s copy of the speech.\u201d", "The conflict reveals the fuzzy rules surrounding the House\u2019s \u201crecord status\u201d of the specific copy given to the speaker.", "Turley, in his blog, said: \u201cI cannot find any source that stipulates the preservation of this document or even requires that it be given to the Speaker.\u201d", "The day after the State of the Union address, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer debated the matter on the House floor. Hoyer argued that Pelosi\u2019s conduct was protected by the First Amendment and McCarthy countered by saying Pelosi \u201chad no right to destroy this document.\u201d But the question of whether the specific, printed version of the speech given to the speaker constituted a \u201cdocument of the House\u201d went unanswered.", "Gaetz, in a column on the website Townhall.com, argued that the signed versions handed to Vice President Mike Pence and Pelosi, as the leaders of the Senate and House respectively, are \u201coriginal documents\u201d that are \u201cnot the \u2018personal property\u2019 of the two recipients, but instead, the permanent record (and property) of the two chambers of Congress. When the document is \u2018received\u2019 by the Speaker of the House, it becomes an official record of the House of Representatives.\u201d", "We asked Gaetz\u2019s office to point us to documentation or evidence that stipulates that process and record-keeping protocol. His office told us that the information was relayed by Republican Rep. Mike Johnson\u2019s office and that Johnson\u2019s office gathered the information from officials in the House clerk and House parliamentarian offices.", "A spokesperson for the House clerk, on the other hand, told us in a statement that \u201cthe Congressional record of the State of the Union address is the transcribed remarks, as recorded by the Official Reporters of the House. The Clerk of the House has a duty to preserve documents transmitted to the Clerk, and a duty to publish the State of the Union address. The Clerk received the President\u2019s prepared State of the Union remarks electronically, which will be preserved for the National Archives.\u201d", "\u201cConsistent with precedent and practice in prior Congresses, immediately after the President\u2019s address to the joint session of Congress, the House, without objection, ordered the President\u2019s remarks to be printed,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe Government Publishing Office has accordingly published the President\u2019s remarks as a presidential address before a joint session of Congress.\u201d", "18 U.S. Code \u00a7\u202f2071.
