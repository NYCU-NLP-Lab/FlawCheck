["Health tourism costs nearly \u00a3300 million on some estimates.", "Correct.", "Recovering the costs of health tourism won\u2019t plug the funding gap the NHS is facing.", "Correct. These costs are relatively small compared to the amounts the NHS will need to find to maintain current services.", "\u201cHealth tourism is allegedly stacking up a bill of over \u00a3200 million, nearly \u00a3300 million, depending on the figures you get\u201d", "David Dimbleby, 2 February 2017", "\u201cEven if we recover all of those costs it's not going to plug the hole that we have coming up in the NHS\u201d", "Maajid Nawaz, 2 February 2017", "It\u2019s correct that the estimated cost of health tourism is up to \u00a3300 million a year. Recovering all these costs will make only a small dent in the overall funding gap the NHS faces.", "\u2018Health tourism\u2019 usually refers to people who deliberately come to the UK to use NHS services they\u2019re not entitled to for free, and people who take advantage of the system by frequently visiting the UK to use GP services and get prescriptions.

The government is putting in extra funds to cover some of that gap, although experts doubt there is enough money being committed to deal with it adequately.", "The estimated costs of health tourism are about 0.3% of health spending on specific services, so savings in this area alone will make a relatively small difference.", "It\u2019s also not a simple matter to recover all the money. David Dimbleby also referred to a report out this week from the Public Accounts Committee which expressed concern over the systems the government had in place..", "Part of the problem is identifying who isn\u2019t entitled to free care and needs to be charged. The committee reported that in 2012/13, the NHS charged 65% of the amounts it could have charged to people from outside Europe and 16% of what it could have charged from those within.", "Full Fact fights for good, reliable information in the media, online, and in politics.", "Bad information ruins lives.
