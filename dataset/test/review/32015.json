["By Eugene Kiely", "Posted on March 26, 2019", "White House counselor Kellyanne Conway falsely claimed that special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report concluded that President Donald Trump engaged in \u201cno \u2014 quote \u2014 \u2018obstructive conduct'\u201d during the Russia investigation. Mueller\u2019s report said it \u201cdoes not exonerate\u201d Trump of obstruction of justice.", "The report, which has yet to be released, \u201cdid not draw a conclusion \u2014 one way or the other \u2014 as to whether the examined conduct [by Trump] constituted obstruction,\u201d Attorney General William P. Barr wrote in a four-page memo summarizing the special counsel\u2019s report.\u00a0\u201cThe Special Counsel states that \u2018while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him,\u2019\u201d Barr wrote.", "Instead, Barr said he and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein made the determination that the evidence is \u201cnot sufficient\u201d to establish that Trump committed obstruction of justice \u2014 which is also not the same as saying there was \u201cno \u2013 quote \u2013 \u2018obstructive conduct,\u2019\u201d as Conway said.", "Conway made her remarks on PBS\u2019 \u201cNewsHour\u201d on March 25, a day after Barr released his memo on Mueller\u2019s confidential report.", "Conway, March 25:\u00a0The president did not try to interfere with the investigation. And that, of course, we know, is in the documentation, that nobody at Justice felt that Mr. Mueller could not do his work. And he did his work in quiet, Judy, for 22 months, and now he has spoken.", "And I think the \u2014 what we know from the Mueller report, through the Barr memo, is instructive not so much for what it says, but for what it doesn\u2019t say, no collusion, no new indictments, no indictments of anybody named Trump, no \u2014 quote \u2014 \u201cobstructive conduct.\u201d", "In making her case that \u201cthe president did not try to interfere with the investigation,\u201d Conway cited \u201cthe Mueller report, through the Barr memo.\u201d\u00a0The phrase that Conway quoted \u2014 \u201cobstructive conduct\u201d \u2014 comes from this section of Barr\u2019s memo:", "Barr, March 24: Generally speaking, to obtain and sustain an obstruction conviction, the government would need to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a person, acting with corrupt intent, engaged in obstructive conduct with a sufficient nexus to a pending or contemplated proceeding. In cataloguing the President\u2019s actions, many of which took place in public view, the report identifies no actions that, in our judgment, constitute obstructive conduct, had a nexus to a pending or contemplated proceeding, and were done with corrupt intent, each of which, under the Department\u2019s principles of federal prosecution guiding charging decisions, would need to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt to establish an obstruction-of-justice offense.", "In other words,\u00a0Barr\u2019s memo merely said that in order to win an obstruction of justice case the government needs to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the presence of all three elements:\u00a0obstructive conduct, corrupt intent and a pending or contemplated investigation. That\u2019s from the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Manual.", "But, in Trump\u2019s case, there was not sufficient evidence to satisfy all three elements. \u201cDeputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and I have concluded that the evidence developed during the Special Counsel\u2019s investigation is not sufficient to establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense,\u201d Barr wrote.", "\u201cHe\u2019s saying at least one of the elements is not met, but not which one,\u201d Eric A. Posner, a law professor at the University of Chicago\u2019s Law School, told us in an email. \u201cI suspect it\u2019s intent he had in mind.\u201d", "We don\u2019t know for sure, but the president\u2019s intent appears to be a factor in Barr\u2019s conclusion that there was not enough evidence to pursue an obstruction of justice charge. He referenced the president\u2019s intent in his memo.", "\u201cIn making this determination, we noted that the Special Counsel recognized that \u2018the evidence does not establish that the President was involved in an underlying crime related to Russian election interference,\u2019 and that, while not determinative, the absence of such evidence bears upon the President\u2019s intent with respect to obstruction,\u201d Barr wrote.", "Former federal prosecutor Gene Rossi\u00a0agreed that Conway\u2019s statement is problematic.", "\u201cShe is absolutely wrong to say that there was no obstructive conduct,\u201d Rossi told us in a phone interview. \u201cThis letter doesn\u2019t say that.\u201d", "Rossi cited a section of Barr\u2019s memo that said there was \u201cevidence on both sides\u201d of the obstruction of justice case.", "\u201cAfter making a \u2018thorough factual investigation\u2019 into these matters, the Special Counsel considered whether to evaluate the conduct under Department standards governing prosecution and declination decisions but ultimately determined not to make a traditional prosecutorial judgment,\u201d Barr wrote. \u201cThe Special Counsel therefore did not draw a conclusion \u2014 one way or the other \u2014 as to whether the examined conduct constituted obstruction. Instead, for each of the relevant actions investigated, the report sets out evidence on both sides of the question and leaves unresolved what the Special Counsel views as \u2018difficult issues\u2019 of law and fact concerning whether the president\u2019s actions and intent could be viewed as obstruction.\u201d", "Rossi said the existence of \u201cpro-obstruction evidence\u201d runs counter to what Conway said.\u00a0The public won\u2019t know what conduct Mueller may have been referring to unless his report is released in some form.", "\u201cWhat she should have said is that there was not enough evidence to warrant prosecution,\u201d Rossi said. \u201cBut to go with this leap that he was totally exonerated, totally cleared \u2014 is absolutely absurd.\u201d", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
