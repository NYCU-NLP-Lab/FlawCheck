But apparently even his rhetoric has limits.", "Copeland tried to rally his followers in a television program posted online on 9 October 2016 by telling them they would be \"held seriously \u2014 seriously \u2014 to account by God\" if they did not vote in the upcoming election:", "You're going to be guilty of murder. You're going to be guilty of an abomination of God. You're going to be guilty for every baby that's aborted from this election forward. You don't cut out on me right now, in the name of Jesus.", "The fake news site Newslo (under their politicops.com domain) accurately quoted Copeland as saying non-voters would be \"guilty of murder,\" but then (as Newslo does with all their \"news\") they turned his fear-mongering up several notches, falsely attributing the following fabricated remarks to him:", "Donald Trump is the only choice for president and you all know it; don\u2019t make the mistake of thinking that Hillary Clinton is anything else than a wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing.
