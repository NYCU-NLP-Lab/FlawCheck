["Kamala Harris was sworn in as vice president on Jan. 20, making her the first woman of color to hold the second highest office in the nation.", "Since\u00a0Joe Biden's selection of Harris as his running mate, headlines and social media posts\u00a0have misinterpreted\u00a0her exact place in history.", "Harris is the first woman, the first woman of color, the first South\u00a0Asian\u00a0American and the first\u00a0Black\u00a0American vice president.\u00a0But she is not the first person of color to hold the office.", "One Facebook post\u00a0pointed out this common misconception.", "Fact or fiction:We're fact checking the news and sending it to your inbox. Sign up to get that here.", "The post includes a photo of Charles Curtis, who was Herbert Hoover's vice president in 1929.", "The photo is paired with text that reads, \"Kamala Harris will not be the first person of color to serve as vice president of the United States. In 1928, Charles Curtis \u2014 a Native American lawmaker and member of the Kaw Nation \u2014 was elected as President Herbert Hoover's vice president. He is the highest-ranking enrolled Native American to ever serve in the federal government.\"", "USA TODAY has reached out to the poster for comment.", "More:Fact check: Vice President Kamala Harris used 2 Bibles when she was sworn in", "Like the post says, Curtis was Hoover's vice president from 1929 to 1933.", "He was born in 1860 in Topeka, Kansas, to his white father and his\u00a0mother, who\u00a0was one-quarter Kaw Indian.", "In its biography of Curtis, the Senate Historical Office writes about his early years, which were spent partially in the Native American community.", "His mother's early death in 1863, paired with\u00a0his father's unstable nature, ultimately left\u00a0Curtis in the custody\u00a0of\u00a0his paternal grandparents.", "However, his maternal grandparents returned to the Kaw reservation in 1865 \u2014 out of concern that they may be excluded from future land agreements \u2014 and Curtis went to live with them on the reservation the following\u00a0year.", "As he grew older, he developed a passion for politics. In 1884, he won election as the county attorney of Shawnee, Kansas. After a loss by a single vote in 1889, Curtis won a seat in the House in 1892.", "Curtis also served in the Senate\u00a0from 1915 until 1929, and was majority leader in 1923 \u2014 the first Republican to hold the title of party floor leader.", "He ran a relatively quiet campaign\u00a0for president against Hoover, and was unsuccessful. According to the biography, Curtis\u00a0agreed to be\u00a0Hoover's running mate\u00a0because of his \"loyalty to the party.\"", "The biography says that as vice president,\u00a0Curtis decorated his office with Native American artifacts and posed for photographs wearing headdresses.", "Following a landslide defeat \u2014 largely due to the worsening economy \u2014\u00a0to Franklin Roosevelt and John Garner in November 1932, Curtis retired from his political career.", "The claim in the post has been rated TRUE. While Kamala Harris is the first woman, the first woman of color, the first South Asian American and the first Black American vice president, she is not the first person of color to hold the office. Charles Curtis, vice president from 1929-1933, is the first person of color to hold the office.", "Thank you for supporting our journalism.
