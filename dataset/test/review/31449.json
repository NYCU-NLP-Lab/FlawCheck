["In a series of tweets, Bharti Jain, a journalist with Times of India made serious allegations of financial misconduct and nepotism against Nobel laureate Amartya Sen and the management of Bihar\u2019s Nalanda University. Her tweets claimed that after Modi\u2019s arrival in 2014, the purported \u201cfraud was stopped and Amartya Sen was thrown out of Nalanda University\u201d. Jain ascribed this as a motive behind Professor Sen\u2019s criticism of the Prime Minister\u2019s economic policies.", "After a social media uproar regarding a lack of evidence to support her allegations, Jain clarified that her tweets were based on \u201csources\u201d and not authored independently.", "I am not the source of this tweet.

While doing so, apart from its own research, Alt News also reached out to Nobel laureate Amartya Sen.", "\u201cThe Economist Amartya Sen was appointed as chairman of Nalanda Mentor Group in 2007 & made first Chancellor of famous Nalanda University(NU) in Bihar by Congress govt in 2012.

Various media outlets had published details of the University statement in 2015.", "The statement termed the claim \u201cfalse\u201d and stated that Dr Sen had received no salary whatsoever from the Nalanda University and all his work for the University was done in an honorary capacity. It also stated that Dr Sen did not receive any \u201cperquisites\u201d from the University.", "Nalanda University further clarified that the free travel pass was a gift to Dr Sen from the Government of India. Former Prime Minister Vajpayee had presented the pass to celebrate his Nobel Prize.", "In an email response to Alt News, Dr Sen labelled journalist Bharti Jain\u2019s allegations as \u201camazingly false\u201d. He elaborated \u2013 \u201cFirst of all, I received from Nalanda no salary whatsoever, and worked for zero remuneration. Second, I had \u201cno tax-free benefits\u201d and there were no \u201cunaccounted foreign travels. Third, I was placed in hotels where the Board meetings were held and where other members of the Board (including representatives of the Ministry of External Affairs \u2013 when meeting outside Delhi) typically stayed.\u201d", "\u201cNine years during Manmohan Singh\u2019s tenure, Amartya Sen ran Nalanda University while mostly staying abroad. He appointed seven faculties. Made Nalanda University a 5-star hotel.\u201d", "A Chancellor does not \u201crun\u201d a university. Unlike a Vice-Chancellor, a Chancellor is an honorary non-resident position. For instance, Venkaiah Naidu is the Chancellor of Delhi University. Section 14 of the Nalanda University Act (2010) passed by the Indian Parliament lays out the responsibilities of a Chancellor.", "Section 15 states that it is the Vice-Chancellor who is the principal academic and executive officer and exercises control over the affairs of the Nalanda University and gives effect to the decisions of all authorities of the University.", "\u201cRegarding my presence at Nalanda, I attended all meetings of the Board and regularly visited the campus and the offices of Nalanda University in Rajgir and New Delhi, and had frequent meetings with the faculty and the students at Nalanda University. In common with Chancellors of other universities, the Nalanda Chancellor is not required to live in the campus (in fact, there is no allocated residence for the Chancellor in the Nalanda campus),\u201d informed Professor Sen.", "Regarding the appointments made by him, he stated, \u201cit was part of my duty to help in the choice and recruitment of distinguished faculty members, and I tried to discharge my responsibilities as well as I could.\u201d", "Professor Sen seemed completely baffled by the accusation of making the Nalanda University a 5-star hotel. He responded, \u201cI cannot guess what Ms Bharti Jain could possibly mean by making \u201cNalanda University a 5-star hotel.\u201d We had no hotel facilities in Nalanda University \u2013 the Board members, when visiting, were placed in nearby hotels.\u201d", "\u201cTotal expenditure was staggering *Rs 2729 crores*\u201d", "While making this claim, Jain seemed to have confused the total budget set aside by the Government of India for establishing and running the Nalanda University with the actual expenditure made during Professor Sen\u2019s tenure.", "A question on the Nalanda University\u2019s budget and expenditure was raised in Lok Sabha in April 2015.

Ms Jain has to distinguish between current expenditure and long-term investment.\u201d", "\u201cFour female faculties, Dr Gopa Sabharwal, Dr Anjana Sharma, Nayanjot Lahiri and Upinder Singh from Delhi University were made faculties. *Upinder Singh is the eldest daughter of Manmohan Singh*, while the remaining three were Upinder\u2019s close friends.\u201d", "Alt News\u2019s fact-check found that Sabharwal was the Vice-Chancellor of the Nalanda University and Sharma was the Dean of Academic Planning, however, no reference could be found in the annual reports of the University regarding Lahiri and Singh.", "Alt News reached out to Professor Nayanjyot Lahiri who categorically denied any association with the University.

At no point did I happen to be part of the faculty at Nalanda and nor have I earned even a rupee from that University in any capacity whatsoever. After leaving the University of Delhi, I joined Ashoka University in 2016.\u201d", "Alt News also reached out to Professor Upinder Singh, daughter of former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.

The two mentioned were never appointed faculty members of Nalanda University (they did not seek such appointment either). The question of their drawing a salary while staying in the USA does not arise (\u201cdrawing salary\u201d for \u201chonorary\u201d appointments raises further questions of truth and falsehood).\u201d", "\u201cAfter 2014, when Modi arrived, all these fraud were stopped and Amartya Sen was thrown out of Nalanda University.

As his tenure of three years was nearing completion, Prof. Sen had publically declared that he wanted to exclude himself from being considered for continuing as Chancellor of Nalanda University beyond July 2015.\u201d", "Professor Sen responded to the allegation of being terminated from the University by stating, \u201cIn fact, I did not seek to continue as Chancellor of Nalanda University (even though the Governing Body had re-elected me to remain Chancellor). I was deterred not only by the Modi-government\u2019s hostility to me but also by observing how terribly badly the Modi-government was treating this ancient (Buddhist-origin) university.\u201d", "Responding to Jain\u2019s claim that he began his criticism of PM Modi\u2019s economic agenda after his exit from Nalanda, Professor Sen said, \u201cI must also point out that I have been criticizing the gigantic blunders in Modi\u2019s economic thinking from much earlier than my departure from Nalanda (indeed from much earlier than becoming Chancellor of Nalanda).\u201d", "Alt News checked for Dr Amartya Sen\u2019s criticism of Narendra Modi before his term as the Prime Minister and found several examples.", "The above fact-check proves from various sources that the viral WhatsApp forward quoted by Bharti Jain was completely baseless.
