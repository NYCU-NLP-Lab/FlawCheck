["By D'Angelo Gore", "Posted on March 22, 2017", "President Donald Trump said that \u201cmany of our best and brightest are leaving the medical profession entirely because of Obamacare.\u201d But the number of physicians has increased since 2010, when the Affordable Care Act became law.", "\u201cWe have anecdotes of physicians thinking about leaving the profession for a variety of reasons, but we see no significant number leaving because of the Affordable Care Act,\u201d said Atul Grover, executive vice president at the\u00a0Association of American Medical Colleges, in an email to FactCheck.org.", "Trump\u2019s latest attack on the health care law came during a \u201cMake America Great Again Rally\u201d in Louisville, Kentucky, on March 20.", "Trump, March 20: Many of our best and brightest are leaving the medical profession entirely because of Obamacare. Obamacare has been a complete and total catastrophe, and it\u2019s getting worse and worse by the day. And yet you watch the fake media, the fake news and they try to build it up. It\u2019s a disaster, fellas. It\u2019s a disaster.", "Actually, the total number of active physicians has increased nearly 8 percent under the health care law, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges. The number jumped from 799,501 when the ACA became law in 2010, to 860,939 in 2015, the most recent data\u00a0available. The increase is similar to the 9 percent jump over the previous five-year period, from 2005 to 2010, according to figures provided to us by the AAMC.", "Since 2010, the number of physicians in internal medicine or providing family and general practice care \u2014 the two largest specialties \u2014 also has increased more than 4 percent.", "Certainly, not all physicians are happy with the health care law. A 2016 survey by the Physicians Foundation and Merritt Hawkins, a consulting firm on physician staffing, found that 48.3 percent of physicians who responded gave the ACA a grade of D or F. A small percentage gave the law an A, and 48.5 percent gave it a B or C.", "But Grover said that \u201crecent data from the Association of American Medical Colleges indicate that physicians are, in fact, retiring two years later than they had previously.\u201d", "He added that \u201cthere is also no evidence of a declining interest in medicine since the ACA took effect.\u201d We pointed that out last month when Sen. Ted Cruz claimed that \u201cObamacare is discouraging people from going to medical school.\u201d In fact,\u00a0medical school applicants and enrollees are at an all-time high.", "As we reported in that story, Grover\u2019s organization has projected a physician shortfall in coming years, due primarily to an aging population. The AAMC set a goal of increasing first-year medical student enrollment by 30 percent by 2015-2016 (from the 2002-2003 level) to address this issue, and it nearly hit that mark on schedule.\u00a0First-year enrollment is expected to reach the AAMC\u2019s goal by 2017-2018, according to the organization\u2019s 2015 enrollment report.", "\u201cThe real challenge the physician workforce faces,\u201d Grover said, \u201cis the cap on federal support for graduate medical education established by Congress 20 years ago. As a result, there are not enough residency positions to fill demand.\u201d", "We requested supporting evidence for the president\u2019s claim from the White House, but we haven\u2019t yet received a response. We will update this item if we do.", "FactCheck.org Rating:", "Read More", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
