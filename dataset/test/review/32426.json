["Donald Trump and Joe Biden aren\u2019t the only people running for president. On some ballots, third-party candidates such a Libertarian Jo Jorgensen, independent Brock Pierce and, yes, rapper Kanye West, who\u2019s running under his own party called the Birthday Party, will be listed below the major party candidates.", "But viral posts on social media claim some of those candidates are performing stronger than is made out.", "More:Fact check: Post misrepresents Biden-Harris event turnout in at Phoenix museum", "The evening of Oct. 13, West tweeted a screenshot from the website of LEX 18 News, a local Kentucky news outlet.
