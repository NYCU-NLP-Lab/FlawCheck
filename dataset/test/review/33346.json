["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "At a candidate forum in Austin, Paul Sadler was asked if he\u2019d support a constitutional amendment overturning the 2010 Supreme Court decision that touched off a flood of super PACs, a type of political action committee that cannot coordinate with a candidate\u2019s campaign, but can independently spend unlimited donations to influence a race.\n\n\"Hell yes, I will,\" Sadler said at the March 1, 2012, Travis County Democratic Party event. Calling the super PACs\u2019 impact \"scandalous,\" the lawyer and former Texas House member said: \"In our race on the Republican side, already, there are four super PACs -- four super PACs -- and it is a distortion of our democracy.\"\n\nSuch PACs are weighing in heavily this election season, raising eyebrows in some cases because they can accept money from certain tax-exempt groups that don\u2019t have to disclose their donors\u2019 names. According to the nonpartisan research group Center for Reponsive Politics\u2019 opensecrets.org, super PACs have spent $65 million in the 2012 cycle so far supporting presidential candidates -- including President Barack Obama, who as PolitiFact noted February 7, 2012, executed a Full Flop in his stance on fundraising for super PACs.\n\nBut four in our little ol\u2019 U.S. Senate race?\n\nJeff Rotkoff, spokesman for Sadler\u2019s campaign to succeed retiring Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, told us the backup for his candidate\u2019s statement was included in Sadler\u2019s February 8, 2012, fundraising email, which cited in turn a Texas Tribune news story from the day before. That story listed four super PACs and linked them to candidates: Texas Conservatives Fund and Conservative Renewal Political Action Committee, supporting Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst; Real Street Conservatives, supporting Craig James; and Club for Growth Action PAC, supporting Ted Cruz.\n\nLike traditional PACs, super PACs register with the Federal Election Commission, which describes supers as \"independent expenditure-only committees.\"\n\nTypically when a super PAC is created, the organizers attach a memo to the FEC stating their intent to make independent expenditures. The FEC website displays those memos for three of the PACs that Sadler referred to.\n\nFor the fourth, we asked Club for Growth spokesman Barney Keller to confirm its super PAC status. Keller told us by email that the club\u2019s Action PAC is its super PAC, distinct from its traditional Club for Growth PAC, which Keller said has endorsed Ted Cruz.\n\nSo, yep: All four are supers. We set out to learn what we could about their activities.\n\nFrom websites and what the four PACs had reported to the FEC through March 6, 2012, we gleaned these thumbnails, keeping in mind that only the Club for Growth super PAC has existed long enough to have filed reports of contributions and expenditures:", "The Club for Growth is a national conservative group that advocates economic growth. According to opensecrets.org, the group spent $5 million on Congressional races in the 2010 election cycle, using its cash for items such as television ads. In the 2012 election cycle, opensecrets.org shows the group has only spent $574,097 so far, but 82 percent, or $468,758, of that has been used against Dewhurst, the website records.\n\nSo, yep: four supers, all linked to Republican candidates in the Texas U.S. Senate race.\n\nSadler told us via email that he did not know of any such PACs supporting him. How would he respond if such a group formed? \"Nothing I or anyone else can do -- I think that is the point, isn't it?,\" he wrote.\n\nWe rate Sadler\u2019s claim True.", "The New York Times topic briefing, \"Campaign Finance (Super PACs),\" \u00a0updated February 27, 2012, accessed March 8, 2012\n\nOpensecrets.org data web page, \"Super PACs, pro-candidate presidential,\" accessed March 8, 2012\n\nPaul Sadler for Senate campaign email, \"How many Super PACs are enough?,\" February 8, 2012\n\nTexas Tribune news story, \"Perry Campaign Manager to Head Dewhurst Super PAC,\" February 7, 2012\n\nEmail interview with Barney Keller, communications director for Club For Growth, March 7, 2012\n\nTexas Conservatives Fund statement of organization, January 30, 2012, www.fec.gov\n\nTelephone interview with Paul Kilgore, March 8, 2012\n\nConservative Renewal Political Action Committee statement of organization, January 27, 2012, www.fec.gov\n\nHouston Chronicle blog entry, \"New kid on the super PAC block,\" February 3, 2012\n\nTelephone interview with Larry Hicks, March 8, 2012\n\nReal Street Conservatives PAC statement of organization, February 1, 2012, www.fec.gov\n\nTelephone interview with Jerad Najvar, March 8, 2012\n\nTelephone interview with Meredith Turney, communications director for Craig James for U.S. Senate campaign, March 8, 2012\n\nAustin American-Statesman blog post, \"A super PAC surfaces in the U.S. Senate race,\" February 3, 2012\n\nClub for Growth Action PAC statement of organization, August 11, 2010, www.fec.gov", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
