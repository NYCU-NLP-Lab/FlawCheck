["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on January 29, 2021", "Dubious websites and viral posts falsely claim that the World Health Organization changed COVID-19 testing protocols for political reasons following Joe Biden\u2019s inauguration and admitted\u00a0that false-positive cases had been inflating the case count. The WHO\u2019s guidance merely reminded labs to follow instructions provided by each test\u2019s manufacturer.", "A recent memo from the World Health Organization designed for lab professionals became a major focus of misinformation \u2014 with unreliable websites and social media users claiming the agency had changed a testing protocol and admitted that COVID-19 cases have been wildly inflated.", "But neither of those claims is accurate.", "Instead, the Jan. 20 memo directed labs facilitating polymerase chain reaction, or\u00a0PCR, tests to carefully follow manufacturer instructions for testing to prevent false positive and negative results.", "The distortions online also tied the purported change to U.S. politics.", "\u201cAn Hour After Joe Biden Is Sworn In, WHO Admits Their Testing Grossly Overstates Individuals Testing Positive for COVID,\u201d read a\u00a0headline from the Gateway Pundit, a website known for spreading misinformation. The story questioned the motives of public health agencies, asking, \u201chow can these entities ever be trusted again?\u201d", "The story was shared more than 8,000 times on Facebook, according to CrowdTangle analytics data.", "Another website, Zero Hedge, which also has previously spread falsehoods, similarly\u00a0told readers: \u201cRight On Cue For Biden, WHO Admits High-Cycle PCR Tests Produce COVID False Positives.\u201d That story was shared on Facebook nearly 7,000 times.", "Many posts also cited a viral\u00a0tweet from David Samadi, a urologist and contributor to the conservative news channel Newsmax, whose work in a New York hospital was the subject of a federal investigation into fraudulent Medicare claims. That hospital reached a $12.3 million settlement in late 2019.", "In his tweet, which has since been deleted, Samadi said the guidance instructed labs \u201cto reduce the cycle count in PCR tests to get a more accurate representation of COVID cases,\u201d because \u201cthe current cycle was much too high and resulting in any particle being declared a positive case.\u201d One Facebook post sharing Samadi\u2019s tweet claimed that the guidance proved \u201cthey\u2019ve been lying to you about case counts and mortality rate THE WHOLE TIME.\u201d", "As we said, the WHO guidance implied\u00a0no such admission. And the memo was an updated version of one issued a month earlier, on Dec. 14, so the idea that it was timed for Biden\u2019s inauguration is wrong.", "As we\u2019ve explained before, PCR tests work by scanning the RNA in a sample, such as a nose swab, and searching for the virus RNA. (See our SciCheck article \u201cThe Facts on Coronavirus Testing.\u201d)", "The PCR test analyzes samples by amplifying a segment of the virus\u2019s genetic material in a series of cycles. A sample with a higher viral load, meaning more virus is present in the sample, will require fewer cycles to detect the novel coronavirus. Lower viral loads will be detected at higher cycles.", "There is no universal threshold setting or endpoint \u2014 \u201calthough 40-45 cycles is often used as the endpoint\u201d of a PCR run \u2014 Ian MacKay, a virologist in Australia, told us in an email.", "The WHO\u2019s Jan. 20 guidance said it was requesting that those conducting tests be sure to read manufacturer instructions \u201ccarefully to determine if manual adjustment of the PCR positivity threshold is recommended.\u201d", "In a statement to FactCheck.org, the WHO said it had received 10 reports since early 2020 about some PCR tests providing both false positive and false negative results and that \u201c[a]fter thorough investigation, WHO confirmed that the tests were not always being used appropriately and in accordance with the instructions provided by the manufacturer.\u201d", "\u201cIn particular, users in laboratories encountered problems with these tests when they did not apply the recommended positivity threshold \u2014 this can result in either false negative results (if the threshold applied is lower) or false positives (if threshold is higher),\u201d the WHO said.", "MacKay said that problem \u201cis not a test issue; it\u2019s a human training and experience issue.\u201d", "\u201cI suspect this is more a problem for certain countries or jurisdictions where rapid roll-out of new testing labs has occurred; labs that are new to public health testing,\u201d MacKay said. \u201cThis would typically involve places that have failed to adequately invest in a good public health laboratory network, to begin with. I don\u2019t think anything shows changing threshold values or less experienced laboratories have driven significant inflation of COVID-19 case counts though.\u201d", "Kelly Wroblewski, director of infectious diseases at the Association of Public Health Laboratories, said in a phone interview that the WHO guidance was a simple reminder that\u00a0if lab professionals deviate from the recommended manufacturer thresholds\u00a0they\u2019re \u201cgoing to over- or under-call the positives or negatives.\u201d She said the issue was not a significant concern in the U.S.", "In a blog post batting down the misconceptions about the WHO\u2019s guidance, MacKay wrote that \u201cthis lab-focused advice has been taken by those with malicious intent, or with too little understanding of the topic, and blown it up into something else entirely wrong.\u201d", "He further emphasized to us that \u201cPCR results are not a diagnosis by themselves\u201d \u2014 they\u2019re part of the COVID-19 diagnosis. WHO advises they be considered in context of other factors, including symptoms and potential exposure to COVID-19.", "PCR tests are considered a gold standard for diagnostics among scientists, and while false negative and positive results are possible with any test, false positives from PCR tests are not thought to be a major or systemic issue \u2014 even positive results at high-cycle threshold values \u2014 experts say.", "For example, MacKay has observed that, looking at COVID-19 data on tests in the United Kingdom, even reducing the \u201ccycle number by 10 (from, for example, 45 to 35), for the sake of appeasement, the majority of positives would still be uncontroversially positive.\u201d", "Matthew Binnicker, a professor of laboratory medicine and pathology at the Mayo Clinic, said the true debate over results at high-cycle threshold values isn\u2019t whether they are \u201cfalse positives.\u201d", "\u201cPCR tests are very specific, and these are not false-positives,\u201d he told us in an email. \u201cThe test is doing what it was designed to do \u2014 detect the viral RNA in samples.\u201d", "Instead, he said, the tension among scientists concerns whether the values can be used \u201cto determine whether someone is, or is not, \u2018infectious'\u201d to others. In other words, the question isn\u2019t whether someone contracted the coronavirus, but rather, whether that person is likely to still be contagious and should be told to isolate and have their contacts traced.", "\u201cSome would argue that we should be ignoring low-positive PCR results (i.e., those with a high PCR cycle threshold value), as these results may mean that someone is no longer infectious,\u201d Binnicker said.", "But, he said, such a result could also mean that a person only very recently became infected and has yet to hit peak infectiousness.", "And, he cautioned, the quality and type of sample can also affect how many cycles are needed to detect the virus, so it\u2019s not always the case that a high-cycle result means a person is harboring remnants or only small amounts of the virus.", "Michael Mina, an assistant professor of epidemiology at Harvard University, likewise said getting positive test results at high-cycle threshold values \u201cdoesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re false positive, they\u2019re still actually detecting the SARS-CoV-2 RNA.\u201d", "Mina said during a call with reporters that the WHO\u2019s memo served as a reminder that \u201cyou have to be discerning about how to evaluate\u201d cycle threshold values. \u201cAnd if you\u2019re going to start using the actual values from the PCR as part of your decision-making,\u00a0[it\u2019s important] to really know what it is you\u2019re doing.\u201d", "For example, if someone is asymptomatic and happened to get a PCR test through testing as part of surveillance in a community, it may be a low viral load detected at a high-cycle threshold value \u2014 which could mean \u201cyou already were infectious and you maybe don\u2019t need to be isolated,\u201d he said.", "\u201cBut it\u2019s very hard to know that. You need to do repeated testing, you need to take that person and test them again,\u201d he added. \u201cOr, test them with an antigen test. That would be the other way to approach it.\u201d (Antigen tests are a\u00a0different type\u00a0of test that can be used to quickly identify an active coronavirus infection.)", "Binnicker also noted that, since patients who test positive for COVID-19 can sometimes continue to test positive long after recovering, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention doesn\u2019t recommend PCR tests be used to determine when someone is no longer infectious. Instead, the agency advises relying on time and symptoms to break from quarantine or isolation.", "Jessica McDonald contributed to this article.", "Editor\u2019s note: SciCheck\u2019s COVID-19/Vaccination Project is made possible by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.
