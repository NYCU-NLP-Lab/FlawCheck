(AP Photo/Gregory Bull)", "Republican gubernatorial candidates John Cox and Travis Allen are competing for the conservative vote in California\u2019s June primary.", "As part of that competition, they\u2019re trying to prove who has the toughest credentials on immigration. Or, in the case of a recent TV attack ad by the Cox campaign, disprove their opponents\u2019 record on the issue.", "Last week, we rated Mostly True Cox\u2019s claim from the same ad that Allen, an Orange County assemblyman, donated to three of California\u2019s top Democrats. We noted the donations took place when Allen was running his financial business full-time and before he ran for office.", "In this fact-check, we\u2019ll examine the ad\u2019s separate allegation that \"on the floor vote, Allen refused to join Republicans opposing driver licenses for illegal aliens.\"", "The ad was\u00a0paid for by John Cox for Governor 2018.", "Did Allen, who has positioned himself as a staunch opponent of benefits for undocumented Californians, really miss this key vote?", "Background on Republican rivals", "Recent polls show increasing support for Cox, a wealthy San Diego businessman, who President Trump endorsed earlier this month. A survey released May 23 by the Public Policy Institute of California shows Gavin Newsom, the state\u2019s lieutenant governor, leading Cox, 25 percent to 19 percent.", "Former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa was third, at 15 percent, followed by Allen with 11 percent, \u00a0State Treasurer John Chiang at 9 percent and former state schools chief Delaine Eastin with 6 percent.", "The top two candidates in the June 5 primary, regardless of party affiliation, will move on to the November runoff.", "Missed vote?", "The claim in the Cox ad refers to votes on AB 60, which the California Legislature approved and Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown signed in 2013. Advocates for the law successfully argued it will make California\u2019s roads safer by ensuring that many of the unauthorized immigrants who already drive have been properly trained and tested.", "Critics argue AB 60 condones law-breaking, and some claim the licenses could be used to commit fraud and that it could increase security risks.", "As of April 2018, the state had issued more than one million licenses under the law, which requires the new cards to display the words \"Federal Limits Apply\" in the top right corner. The license is for driving privileges only and not for federal use, such as boarding a plane. Nor does it allow undocumented Californians to vote, despite inflammatory claims to the contrary.", "Legislative records show Allen and other Assembly Republicans voted against the measure during a floor vote on May 29, 2013.", "But that wasn\u2019t Allen\u2019s final chance to weigh in on the bill.", "During a final concurrence vote on September 12, 2013, records show no vote was recorded for Allen. The lawmaker was present at the Capitol that day, and voted on bills \u00a0before and after the final decision on AB 60, according to records kept by the Assembly Journal. Allen\u2019s vote would not have made the difference, as the bill passed 55 to 21.", "Asked about this, Allen\u2019s campaign spokeswoman pointed to the lawmaker\u2019s May vote.
