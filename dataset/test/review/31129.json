["The president strayed from the facts, mainly on immigration and the economy.", "By Eugene Kiely, Brooks Jackson, Lori Robertson, Robert Farley, D'Angelo Gore and Jessica McDonald", "Posted on February 6, 2019", "President Donald Trump\u2019s State of the Union address included many claims that were familiar to fact-checkers. He has repeated most of these assertions before:", "The president\u2019s address on Feb. 5 had been delayed by a week in the aftermath of a partial government shutdown. His remarks, and the false and misleading claims we noted, mainly concerned the issues of immigration and the economy.", "Trump\u00a0wrongly claimed\u00a0that El Paso transformed from a city with one of the highest violent crime rates to \u201cone of the safest cities in our country\u201d immediately after a border barrier was erected. Actually, El Paso was a relatively safe city\u00a0before\u00a0construction of a 57-mile-long fence started in mid-2008. And violent crime did not drop \u201cimmediately\u201d after a fence was completed.", "Trump: The border city of El Paso, Texas, used to have extremely high rates of violent crime \u2014 one of the highest in the entire country, and considered one of our nation\u2019s most dangerous cities. Now, immediately upon its building, with a powerful barrier in place, El Paso is one of the safest cities in our country.", "As\u00a0we wrote\u00a0when Trump made a similar claim on Jan. 14, El Paso has never been \u201cone of our nation\u2019s most dangerous cities.\u201d The city had the third lowest violent crime rate among 35 U.S. cities with a population over 500,000 in 2005, 2006 and 2007 \u2013 before construction of a 57-mile-long fence started in mid-2008.", "Nor did violent crime drop \u201cimmediately\u201d after the fence went up. In fact, the city\u2019s violent crime rate increased 5.5 percent from 2007 to 2010 \u2014 the years before and after construction of the fence, which was completed in mid-2009. Those years were not anomalies. Violent crime increased about 9.6 percent between 2006 and 2011 \u2014 two years before the fence construction began and two years after it was finished.", "Along with the rest of the country, El Paso\u2019s violent crime rate spiked in the early 1990s and has been trending downward ever since. The city\u2019s violent crime rate dropped 62 percent from its peak in 1993 to 2007, a year before construction on the fence began.", "Trump referred twice to human trafficking when making the case for ending illegal immigration.\u00a0However, experts say typically the cases they deal with concerning foreign nationals are people brought through legal ports of entry.", "The president said it was time \u201cfor the Congress to show the world that America is committed to ending illegal immigration and putting the ruthless coyotes, cartels, drug dealers, and human traffickers out of business.\u201d But ending illegal immigration wouldn\u2019t end human trafficking.", "He later said the traffickers \u201ctake advantage of the wide open areas between our ports of entry to\u00a0smuggle thousands of young girls and women into the United\u00a0States and to sell them into prostitution and modern-day slavery.\u201d There\u2019s no data on how many are smuggled illegally across the border with Mexico for human trafficking, experts say.", "\u201cYes, in some cases it does happen,\u201d\u00a0Brandon Bouchard,\u00a0director of media relations for\u00a0Polaris, which operates the National Human Trafficking Hotline, said of people being smuggled across the border. Based on the group\u2019s experience, however, \u201cwe believe the vast majority of people are coming through legal ports of entry.\u201d And the statistics the group has, which come from the calls it receives through the hotline, show that labor trafficking is the largest trafficking issue for foreign nationals.", "\u201cWhen it\u2019s labor trafficking, people are recruited in their home country under false pretenses,\u201d Bouchard told us. \u201cThey think they\u2019re coming into the U.S. for a job.\u201d", "The available data suggest most come through ports of entry.\u00a0The United Nations\u2019 International Organization on Migration\u00a0has found\u00a0that \u201cnearly 80% of international human trafficking journeys cross through official border points, such as airports and land border control points,\u201d based on 10 years\u2019 worth of cases on which the IOM has assisted.", "\u201cChildren are less likely to be trafficked through official border points: out of all the children in our sample, official border points are used in 56% of cases,\u201d the Counter-Trafficking Data Collaborative, an IOM initiative, says.", "Polaris\u2019 data for the U.S. come from those who call its hotline. From January 2015 through the end of June 2018, calls to the hotline reported more than 35,000 potential victims of trafficking. And of those victims whose immigration status was known (nearly 14,000), half were U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents and half were foreign nationals, according to Bouchard.", "Martina Vandenberg, founder and president of the\u00a0Human Trafficking Legal Center, told us the center searched its database of 1,435 trafficking cases since 2009 for those involving kidnapping or smuggling charges. It found 26 and 29 cases, respectively, that also included those charges. \u201cThe data refute the claims Trump is making about the efficacy of a wall,\u201d she said.", "Evangeline M. Chan, director of the Immigration Law Project at\u00a0Safe Horizon, a group that assists trafficking survivors in New York City, said that trafficking \u201cis a much more complex and nuanced problem than most people realize.\u201d The type of coercion used is \u201ca lot more subtle\u201d than a kidnapping-type scenario.", "Typically what Chan sees are victims who are \u201clured into the country with promises of a better life.\u201d They\u2019re \u201cvery often brought to the country legally through ports of entry and using visas and legal documents.\u201d", "A large portion of the survivors Safe Horizon assists are from Southeast Asia, but the next area of origin is Mexico and Central America, she said.", "Trump\u00a0also said\u00a0a \u201cstrong security wall\u201d along San Diego\u2019s border with Mexico \u201calmost completely ended illegal crossings.\u201d That\u2019s not accurate.", "According to a\u00a02009 report\u00a0by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, the U.S. Border Patrol began in 1990 to build a 14-mile fence along San Diego\u2019s border with Mexico. The fence was completed in 1993, but it could not alone stop the flow of people crossing the border illegally, CRS said.", "\u201cThe primary fence, by itself, did not have a discernible impact on the influx of unauthorized aliens coming across the border in San Diego,\u201d CRS said.", "In response, Border Patrol on Oct. 1, 1994, launched \u201cOperation Gatekeeper,\u201d which provided significant manpower and other resources along the border.", "CRS, March 16, 2009:\u00a0Operation Gatekeeper resulted in significant increases in the manpower and other resources deployed to San Diego sector. Agents received additional night vision goggles, portable radios, and four-wheel drive vehicles, and light towers and seismic sensors were deployed. According to the former INS, between October 1994 and June of 1998, San Diego sector saw the following increases in resources:", "In fiscal year 1992, border patrol\u00a0apprehended\u00a0565,581 immigrants attempting to cross into the U.S. illegally in the 60-mile San Diego sector. Apprehensions fluctuated in the following few fiscal years (531,689 in 1993,\u00a0450,152 in 1994,\u00a0524,231 in 1995 and 483,815 in 1996) before significantly dropping beginning in fiscal year 1997 (283,889) and the years thereafter,\u00a0according to USBP statistics.", "By fiscal year 2010, apprehensions had dropped to 68,565 and declined further to\u00a026,290 by fiscal 2015.", "In a video, CBP\u00a0credits the decline\u00a0to a strategy that included \u201c[i]ncreased manpower, utilized intelligence, focused prosecutions, technology was advanced and tactical infrastructure was improved by adding fencing, all-weather roads and stadium lighting.\u201d", "In calling on Congress to approve his border security plan, which includes spending $5.7 billion on a border wall,\u00a0Trump said\u00a0it is needed to stop the flow of illegal drugs into the United States from Mexico.", "Trump, Feb. 5:\u00a0Tens of thousands of innocent Americans are killed by lethal drugs that cross our border and flood into our cities \u2014 including meth, heroin, cocaine and fentanyl.", "However, as we\u00a0have\u00a0written,\u00a0experts \u2014 including those within his administration \u2014 say that the majority of illicit drugs from Mexico enter the U.S. in cars and trucks traveling through legal ports of entry.", "That\u2019s particularly true of\u00a0deadly\u00a0opioids\u00a0\u2014 heroin and fentanyl \u2014 that the president singled out in his speech.", "The\u00a02018 National Drug Threat Assessment\u00a0says the Southwest border \u201cremains the primary entry point for heroin into the United States.\u201d", "\u201cThe majority of the [illegal heroin] flow is through [privately owned vehicles]\u00a0entering the United States at legal ports of entry, followed by tractor-trailers, where the heroin is co-mingled with legal goods,\u201d the report said.", "\u201cA small percentage of all heroin seized by CBP along the land border was between Ports of Entry,\u201d the report added.", "The DEA report also said Mexican cartels \u201cmost commonly smuggle the multi-kilogram loads of fentanyl concealed in\u201d privately owned vehicles through the legal ports of entry.", "Last month, U.S. Customs and Border Protection made the\u00a0largest fentanyl bust\u00a0in its history when a Mexican national \u201cattempted to enter the United States through the Port of Nogales.\u201d Border agents discovered nearly 254 pounds of fentanyl worth about $3.5 million \u201cconcealed within a special floor compartment of a trailer that was laden with cucumbers.\u201d", "For an earlier story we\u00a0wrote\u00a0in August 2017,\u00a0Peter Reuter, a University of Maryland criminal justice professor who founded and directed RAND\u2019s Drug Policy Research Center from 1989 to 1993, told us he was skeptical of Trump\u2019s repeated claims that a wall \u2014 or more accurately, building additional physical barriers \u2014 would stop drugs from coming into the United States from Mexico.", "In addition to the fact that most drugs come through legal ports of entry, Reuter said that smugglers have a history of adapting to law enforcement\u2019s attempts to stop the flow of illegal drugs.", "Trump\u00a0said\u00a0that \u201cmore people are working now than at any time in our history \u2013- 157 million.\u201d That\u2019s roughly accurate, but it\u2019s not such a remarkable feat when taking into account steady population growth.", "Although Trump is\u00a0fond of citing this statistic, the number of people working in the U.S. has increased fairly steadily for as long as such figures have been tracked by the\u00a0Bureau of Labor Statistics.", "There have been exceptions, notably during recessions, when the number of people employed has declined even as the population increased. That\u2019s what happened during the Great Recession. But after the Great Recession ended in 2009, the number of people employed in the U.S. began rising steadily (again) in early 2010, and has set historical \u201crecords\u201d every month since mid-2014. So President Barack Obama could have correctly claimed that there were more people employed in the U.S. than at any time in the country\u2019s history for 32 straight months at the end of his presidency (though we could find no evidence that he ever did).", "A more meaningful way to take the population increase into account is to look at the\u00a0labor force participation rate, which BLS defines as a measure of the number of people in the labor force as a percentage of the population. The\u00a0labor force participation rate\u00a0for people ages 25 to 54 in January was 82.6 percent, according to BLS. That\u2019s a little more than 1 percentage point higher than when Trump took office, but it is not the highest in history. It was higher from the late 1980s to the late 2000s, and peaked at 84.6 percent in January 1999.", "Another good measure is the\u00a0employment-population ratio, which is the percentage of the population that is working. Looking again at\u00a0that statistic\u00a0just for those ages 25 to 54, the ratio has been steadily climbing since 2011, and was at 79.9 percent in January. But that\u2019s not a record high either. It peaked at 81.9 percent in April 2000.", "Later in his speech, Trump\u00a0boasted, \u201cAll Americans can be proud that we have more women in the workforce than ever before.\u201d That\u2019s also not so extraordinary, given population growth. The number of women in the workforce has set records fairly consistently for as far back as the\u00a0Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2018 online tool goes, to 1964. As with overall employment, there was a dip in the number of working women during the Great Recession, but the number has been climbing steadily since late 2010, and has again been setting new historical highs every month since July 2013.", "Trump exaggerated the number of job gains on his watch.", "Trump:\u00a0We have created 5.3 million new jobs and importantly added 600,000 new manufacturing jobs \u2014 something which almost everyone said was impossible to do.", "Actually, Bureau of Labor Statistics figures show the economy has added just under\u00a04.9 million jobs\u00a0since January 2017, when he took office \u2014 not 5.3 million. And the economy added\u00a0454,000 manufacturing jobs\u00a0during Trump\u2019s tenure \u2014 not 600,000.", "Trump prefaced his remark by saying he was speaking of the time \u201csince the election,\u201d thus claiming credit for jobs created during that last months of Barack Obama\u2019s time in office.", "But even so, he\u2019s way off on the manufacturing jobs. Only 481,000 have been added since November 2016. To get a gain of 600,000 you must go back to September 2014. Trump is claiming credit for jobs created months before he even\u00a0announced\u00a0he was running for the White House.", "The president boasted that \u201cAfrican American, Hispanic American and Asian American unemployment have all reached their lowest levels ever recorded.\u201d", "It\u2019s true that the unemployment rates for all three groups reached the lowest ever recorded in at least one month during the last year, but the percentage point gap between white unemployment and the rate for black and Hispanic Americans has remained about the same. Also, the unemployment rates for all Americans, including for African Americans, Hispanics and Asians, has been steadily dropping since late 2010 and early 2011.", "The\u00a0black unemployment rate\u00a0dropped to its lowest level, 5.9 percent, in May 2018, since the BLS began measuring it in 1972. It has since inched back up, and was at 6.8 percent in January. The white unemployment rate in January was 3.5 percent, or 3.3 percentage points lower than the black unemployment rate. When Trump took office in January 2017, the black unemployment rate was 7.7 percent, 3.4 percentage points higher than the rate for whites.", "The percentage point gap between white and\u00a0Hispanic unemployment rates\u00a0has also remained about the same. In January 2017, the Hispanic rate, at 5.8 percent, was 1.5 percentage points higher than the rate for whites, and in January, the Hispanic rate was 4.9 percent, 1.4 percentage points higher than for whites.", "\u201cThe declines in [black] unemployment are tracking those of the overall economy but remain double those of white workers,\u201d\u00a0Marcus Casey,\u00a0a fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution, told us via email. \u201cThis has been the case for a long time. While certainly this looks a lot better than the Great Recession, it\u2019s notable that over this period blacks became more educated and skilled, yet are still unable to break this long historical trend.\u201d", "Last year, when Trump similarly took credit for the lowest black unemployment rate in U.S. history, Casey and Bradley Hardy, another Brookings fellow, wrote a\u00a0paper\u00a0arguing that \u201cthe unemployment rate alone presents a revealing but incomplete picture of economic well-being within any community.\u201d", "We also have noted that unemployment rates in general, as well as those for black and Hispanic Americans, have been steadily declining since late 2010 and early 2011. (See chart below.)", "The black unemployment rate fell 8.8 percentage points in the seven years before Trump took office, and it has continued to drop in the two years under Trump. The rate was 7.7 percent in January 2017, when Trump took office. So it dropped a little less than 1 percentage point in the two years under Trump.", "Trump also inflated the reduction in food-stamp recipients.", "Trump:\u00a0Nearly 5 million Americans have been lifted off food stamps.", "Actually, since Trump took office, the\u00a0number has\u00a0gone down 4.1 million\u00a0 \u2014 not 5 million. That\u2019s as of September, the most recent month for which figures are available.", "Once again, Trump is padding his numbers by claiming credit for things that occurred during Obama\u2019s final months as president, after Trump was elected but before he took office.", "The president\u2019s comments on two state abortion bills require context.", "Trump: Lawmakers in New York cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother\u2019s womb moments from birth. These are living, feeling, beautiful babies who will never get the chance to share their love and their dreams with the world.\u00a0And then, we had the case of the governor of Virginia where he stated he would execute a baby after birth.", "The New York law the president referenced is the\u00a0Reproductive Health Act, which\u00a0Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo\u00a0signed\u00a0on Jan. 22, the anniversary of Roe v. Wade.\u00a0As we\u2019ve\u00a0written in more detail, the law modifies the state\u2019s existing abortion law to expand the circumstances under which abortions after 24 weeks are allowed.", "Previously, pregnancies after 24 weeks could be terminated only if they were life-threatening. The new law provides for two more instances in which abortions would be allowed: the \u201cabsence of fetal viability\u201d or to protect the patient\u2019s health.", "Trump also alluded to statements Gov.\u00a0Ralph Northam made in a radio\u00a0interview\u00a0following the controversial introduction of a similar abortion bill in Virginia. In the interview, Northam, who is a physician, said third-trimester abortion is \u201cdone in cases where there may be severe deformities. There may be a fetus that\u2019s nonviable. So in this particular example, if a mother\u2019s in labor, I can tell you exactly what would happen. The infant would be delivered, the infant would be kept comfortable, the infant would be resuscitated if that\u2019s what the mother and the family desired. And then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother.\u201d", "Northam\u2019s words were interpreted by some to mean that he was suggesting infanticide. As\u00a0multiple\u00a0news\u00a0outlets\u00a0reported, Northam later clarified that he was not talking about infanticide.\u00a0A spokesperson for Northam said his comments were \u201cfocused on the tragic and extremely rare case in which a woman with a nonviable pregnancy or severe fetal abnormalities went into labor.\u201d", "Trump claimed credit for the country\u2019s energy resources, saying, \u201cWe have unleashed a revolution in American energy \u2014 the United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world.\u201d", "It\u2019s true that America is the top producer of both oil and natural gas. But, according to the Energy Information Administration, the United States became the\u00a0top natural gas producer\u00a0in 2009 after surpassing Russia, and also has been number one in petroleum production since 2013.", "Over the summer, the EIA\u00a0announced\u00a0that\u00a0America\u2019s crude oil production exceeded Russia\u2019s for the first time since 1999, making it the leading producer in the world. But the boom has been in the works for a\u00a0decade,\u00a0and has long been expected. As we\u2019ve\u00a0written before, the International Energy Agency predicted in its\u00a02012 World Energy Outlook\u00a0that the U.S. would take the top crude oil spot by 2020, driven by hydraulic fracturing, or fracking.", "Trump also said that \u201cfor the first time in 65 years, we are a net exporter of energy.\u201d The United States is not yet a net exporter of energy. As of Jan. 29, the EIA\u00a0predicted\u00a0that the nation would export more energy than it imports in 2020. That\u2019s soon, but it\u2019s not a milestone that the president can accurately claim.", "The EIA\u00a0explains\u00a0that America has imported more energy than it exports since 1953. The anticipated switch to net exporter is due to increases in crude oil, natural gas and natural gas plant liquids production that outstrip domestic consumption.", "Trump said that \u201cafter four decades of rejection, we passed VA Accountability so that we can finally terminate those who mistreat our wonderful veterans.\u201d But it\u2019s not true that nothing could previously be done to fire VA employees.", "As\u00a0we\u2019ve written before, the bipartisan Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act aims to make it easier for the VA secretary to remove employees by, among other things, shortening the firing process and expediting the appeals process for senior executives. However, employees could still be fired before that legislation became law.", "The Office of Personnel Management\u00a0keeps data\u00a0on federal employment, including\u00a0terminations for discipline or performance\u00a0going back to fiscal year 2005. The data show that, on average, the VA fired about 2,300 employees each fiscal year before Trump\u2019s presidency. The average is nearly the same when calculated by calendar year, which lines up more closely to when presidents take office in late January.
