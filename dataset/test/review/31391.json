But a small-print citation Bynum-Coleman used in the ad to back the claim was inaccurate. She cited Cox for a 2013 vote against the state budget with a teacher raise when, actually, he supported it. It was another delegate - John Cox - who opposed the budget.", "Bynum-Coleman stopped the ad, and put up a new version the next day with the same claim and video, but amended sources. Cox\u2019s campaign says the commercial is still inaccurate. So we fact-checked the second ad to see if Cox, a former teacher, \"joined with special interests to deny teachers a raise.\"", "Cox\u2019s Voting Record", "Cox joined the General Assembly in 1990. We tracked his voting record on teacher raises from 2005, which is the earliest year Bynum-Coleman cites in her contention that Cox has opposed pay hikes.", "Cox, a retired teacher, has been in a strong position to influence teacher pay. From, 2005-2017, he sat on the budget-writing Appropriations Committee, a subcommittee of it that oversaw money going to public schools, and was on a small team of House negotiators who worked out final spending deals with the Senate. He became speaker in 2018.", "Teacher raises are not singled out for a vote in the General Assembly. They appear as line items in thick state budgets hundreds of pages long. Since 2005, the legislature has approved seven budgets with lasting teacher pay raises, a Cox voted for each one. Here are the raises:", "*2005, 3%;", "*2006, 3%;", "*2007. 3%;", "*2013, 2%;", "*2015, 1.5%;", "*2018, 3%; and", "*2019, 2%.", "The state paid half the amount of each raise and localities were responsible for the rest,", "There were also two times when Cox voted with the General Assembly to pass teacher pay raises and later supported rescinding them before they went into effect because of low state revenues.", "In 2008, Cox backed a 2% raise to start on July 1, 2009. In early 2009, as the state slid into the Great Recession, Cox voted with the General Assembly to cancel rescind the pay hike.", "In 2016, he supported a 2% to begin July 1, 2017 if projected state revenues didn\u2019t fall more than 1% below projections. Revenues missed that target and in early 2017 Cox voted with the General Assembly to cancel the raise.", "Overall, Cox unfailingly voted each year for incremental\u00a0 versions of the state budget that were passed by the Appropriations Committee, the House, and the full General Assembly. Don\u2019t forget that he had an influential role at each step.", "Bynum-Coleman\u2019s sources", "In her amended second ad, Bynum Coleman offers three citations to back her claim that Cox \"joined special interests to deny teachers a raise.\" All of them are at least eight years old. Parker Slaybaugh, Cox\u2019s spokesman, said the speaker doesn\u2019t recall any of the incidents.", "One citation is a 2005 bill that would have established a policy goal to raise Virginia teacher salaries to the national average. The bill, which didn\u2019t set a target date to reach the goal or seek money, passed the Senate. It died in House Appropriations Committee that Cox sat on without being brought up for a vote.", "There\u2019s no record of any action by Cox on the bill. Rob Silverstein, campaign manager for Bynum-Coleman, said that\u2019s tantamount to Cox opposing raising teacher salaries to the national average. \"He could have moved the bill forward, but he let it die,\" Silverstein said.", "Slaybaugh said Cox, in 2005, was a junior member of the 22-person committee and wouldn\u2019t have had the sway to advance the bill. He noted that this summer, Cox called for hitting the national pay average in four years. Silverstein dismissed the action as an election-year stunt.", "Bynum-Coleman also cites a failed 2011 bill as evidence of Cox\u2019s opposition to teacher raises.\u00a0 It would have allowed local school boards to use unspent funds for a one-time bonus teachers bonus up to 3% of their salaries. The legislation died on an unrecorded voice vote in Cox\u2019s seven-member subcommittee.", "Bynum-Coleman\u2019s third citation is a confusing editorial that ran in The Virginian-Pilot on Aug. 31, 2008.\u00a0 It said Cox and two other delegates backed a change in the state school-funding formula \"that would have ended the state\u2019s obligation to pick up a share of supplemental raises awarded by cities and counties.\"", "What\u2019s baffling is that the state doesn\u2019t have an obligation - now or then - to pay a portion of teacher raises originating in localities. The opposite is true. We found nothing to corroborate the editorial in a search of state newspapers.", "We asked Silverstein if he knew details about the editorial\u2019s statement. \"The story speaks for itself,\" he said.", "Special Interests", "Key to Bynum-Coleman\u2019s ad is her claim that Cox \"joined special interests\" in \"denying\" teacher pay raises. Our legislative memory, dating to 1986, doesn\u2019t recall any organized lobby against teacher raises. The economy has been the driving force: In good times, teachers usually get raises; in tight times, they don\u2019t.", "We asked Silverstein to identify the special interests. He said he was driving and would get back with an answer. We\u2019re still waiting.", "Our ruling", "Bynum-Coleman\u2019s TV ad says \"Cox joined special interests to deny teachers raises.\"\u00a0 She had to temporarily pull the ad because it claimed Cox voted against a 2013 state budget with a teacher raise when, actually he supported it.", "Bynum-Coleman\u2019s corrected ad offers three citations to back her claim, all of them at least seven years old. Two concern the death of bills in the House Appropriations Committee where Cox was a member, One in 2005, would have set an open-ended\u00a0 goal to raise teacher salaries to the national average; the other would have let school boards spend surpluses in 2013 for a one-time bonus. The third source is two confusing sentences in a 2008 editorial.", "Cox says he doesn\u2019t remember any of these occasions and it would be nice if he did. None of Bynum\u2019s evidence of leads to a recorded vote although Cox, if he followed form, was likely to have gone along with the committee\u2019s Republican majority. And none of her evidence centers on Cox\u2019s actions when there was money on the table for salary increases.", "There have been seven budgets since 2005 that raised teacher salaries and Cox voted for each one. Two other times, he supported budgets with pay raises, and a year later voted with the General Assembly to rescind them before they took effect because of flagging state revenues.", "All told, Cox\u2019s record matches the legislature\u2019s since 2005. He voted for nine teacher pay hikes and twice to later cancel them.", "Bynum-Coleman offers no proof for her charge Cox joined special interests to stop teacher raises.
