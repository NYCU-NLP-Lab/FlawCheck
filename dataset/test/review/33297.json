However, he has responded well to chemotherapy, and on March 4, 2020, he shared an update on the one-year anniversary of his diagnosis. He revealed on April 14 that he has written a memoir set for publication in July.", "However, a bogus article announcing his death has been shared around\u00a04,700 times on Facebook, according to CrowdTangle data.", "The story falsely claims that Trebek has died at the age of 80 \u201cas a result of complications\u201d \u2014 though it doesn\u2019t specify any \u201ccomplications.\u201d And it claims Trebek has left his estate to President Donald Trump\u2019s reelection campaign.", "The story also calls Trebek \u201ca lifelong Republican and a fervent Trump supporter\u201d who stated that leaving his estate \u201cestimated to be valued at 100 million dollars\u201d to Trump\u2019s reelection campaign was \u201c\u2018the best thing I can do for the future of my grandchildren.'\u201d", "The article was created by America\u2019s Last Line of Defense \u2014 a network of satirical news websites, including conservativetears.com, where the Trebek story was originally posted. The Trebek story is clearly labeled as a \u201cdeath hoax\u201d on the original website, and there are several signs in the story itself that it\u2019s not true.
