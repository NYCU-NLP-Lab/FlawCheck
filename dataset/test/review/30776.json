First, Baris said \"there are 132k CoA flags in Fulton County, alone,\" referring to change of address flags in voter rolls, which implies that those voters might have been ineligible to vote in that county. Then he cited two queries of a Georgia voter database and included screenshots of both searches.", "One of the queries Baris ran was for Fulton County voters including people \"flagged\" in the records for change of address, and the other query excluded people flagged for change of address. Baris\u2019 claim about potentially ineligible ballots is based on the number of \"unique individuals\" listed for each query: the number is 842,486 when including those with a \"change of address flag\" in the records, and 710,454 when excluding those who have a \"change of address flag,\" a difference of 132,032.", "The screenshots do not include any detail such as links that would allow others to replicate the search or verify its results. Baris did not indicate that the information had been verified with or vetted by election officials, who in many cases during the 2020 election have offered reasonable explanations for theories being floated.", "Jessica Corbitt-Dominguez, director of external affairs for Fulton County government, told PolitiFact the claim is \"completely unsubstantiated.\" A county spokeswoman also provided a statement saying, \"Fulton County is aware of allegations of 132,000 ballots being \u2018flagged.\u2019 These claims are simply false and baseless. Certain news organizations have circulated this information without contacting Fulton County for confirmation.\"", "On Monday, Georgia Lt. Gov.
