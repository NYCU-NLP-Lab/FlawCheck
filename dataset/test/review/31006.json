This rumor originated with a satirical post on the message board Democratic Underground:", "In a surprise move during the weekend, Speaker Ryan proposed that Prosperity Gospel champion, Joel Osteen, become the new chaplain for the U.S. House of Representatives. In a brief comment, the Speaker said, \"America needs to become more prosperous. It needs a new approach to individual wealth. Pastor Osteen carries that message and shows us the way. Working Americans should be grateful to pay more taxes to the Federal Government. As Jesus, himself, said, 'It will be returned an hundred-fold.'

I agree with the good Pastor, and will be introducing new legislation to that effect soon.\"", "The author of this post, a user identified as \"MineralMan,\" wrote in the comments that the \"evil grin\" emoticon included at the bottom of the post indicated that the text was satirical.
