In fact, all eight of the state\u2019s rating areas have at least one carrier and three of them have two carriers.", "Trump met at the White House with a group of House members on March 17 to discuss the American Health Care Act.\u00a0With the House members seated with him in the Oval Office, Trump discussed his recent visit to Tennessee\u00a0and the state of its health care system.", "Trump, March 17:\u00a0I was in Tennessee \u2014 I was just telling the folks \u2014 and half of the state has no insurance company and the other half is gonna lose the insurance company. The people don\u2019t know what to do. It\u2019s a disaster. Obamacare is dead.", "Tennessee divides the state into eight rating areas. Three of the eight \u2014 the East, Greater Nashville and Greater Memphis areas \u2014 have two carriers selling health insurance on the federal marketplace set up by the Affordable Care Act, according to the state\u2019s 2017 rating area plans and rates. The other five rating areas have only one carrier.", "It is important that at least one company is selling insurance on the marketplace in each rating area, because the federal government provides tax credits and subsidies to help pay for insurance only for those who purchase plans on the exchanges set up by the Affordable Care Act.", "Insurance carriers in the ACA marketplace offer multiple plans \u2014 such as\u00a0bronze, silver and gold\u00a0\u2014 which offer different levels of coverage at different prices.

There were more than 234,000 ACA plans selected in Tennessee during enrollment period that ended Jan. 31, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.", "It may be that some in Tennessee will be without a marketplace insurance plan next year, but Trump is wrong to say that\u00a0\u201chalf of the state has no insurance company and the other half is gonna lose the insurance company.\u201d", "FactCheck.org Rating:", "Read More", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population.
