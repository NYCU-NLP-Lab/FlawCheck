["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "For the past two years, Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed has been one of the most vocal advocates in support of a regional sales tax to pay for more than 150 transportation projects he and proponents say will ease congestion in the region.\n\nSupporters also say the 1 percent tax would jolt the region\u2019s economy by creating jobs for people working on those transportation projects. An earlier claim by tax proponents said that the plan will \"create or support an additional 200,000 new jobs.\" PolitiFact found that number gave an inflated impression of the plan's impact, and the jobs-creation claim earned a Mostly False on the Truth-O-Meter. \u00a0\n\nCritics say the tax will benefit construction companies and the well-connected, but do little to untangle the region\u2019s transportation gridlock.\n\nReed\u2019s statement concerned only the number of jobs lost in the economic downturn.\n\nThe mayor was very vocal about the need for more jobs during a news conference at City Hall to announce the Atlanta Business League\u2019s support for the July 31 referendum. The sales tax could raise $8.5 billion over 10 years, after inflation.\n\n\"The city of Atlanta and the state of Georgia, we\u2019ve lost 200,000 jobs since the year 2007,\" Reed began. \"We\u2019ve lost 50,000 construction jobs since the year 2007.\"\n\nWe wanted to know if hizzoner has potential as a labor economist. Or are the mayor\u2019s numbers incorrect?\n\nPolitiFact Georgia went to the most commonly used and dependable source of labor data, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. For our purposes, we focused on state employment figures.\n\nFirst, the overall employment numbers. In May 2012, the most recent monthly BLS data available, an estimated 3,930,000 Georgians were employed. In May 2007, the number of Georgians employed 4,139,000, the federal data shows. The difference is 209,000 people.\n\nSo far, so good for the mayor.\n\nNow, what about the construction data? In May 2007, the BLS said about 222,700 Georgians were employed in the construction industry. In May 2012, the number dropped to an estimated 141,300 Georgians. The difference: 81,400.\n\nThat\u2019s actually more people who\u2019ve lost their jobs in construction than Reed said at the City Hall event.\n\nReal estate has long been a bedrock industry in metro Atlanta with the region\u2019s rapid population growth in recent decades. The Great Recession hurt the real estate industry tremendously. Construction levels dropped nearly 80 percent between 2006 -- its peak year -- and 2010, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported in 2011.\n\nThe federal data shows construction employment declined each month between August 2007 and September 2010. Employment rose for a few months in early 2011, but has largely declined since.\n\nAs for the overall employment numbers, the decline since 2007 also has been largely blamed on the recession. The number of Georgians employed has increased by about 92,000 since May 2010, the BLS numbers show.\n\nReed\u2019s overall point is that the region could use the jobs that might be created by these transportation projects. And it is uncertain how many jobs the projects would create.\n\nBut the jobs-loss numbers Reed used to back up his argument were correct for the number of total jobs lost since 2007. Reed actually underestimated the total of jobs lost since 2007 in the construction industry.\n\nOverall, we rate his statement as True.", "The Atlanta Journal-Constitution Political Insider, \"Kasim Reed speaks up for T-SPLOST: \u2018Just surviving means just surviving,\u2019 \" July 17, 2012, http://blogs.ajc.com/political-insider-jim-galloway/2012/07/17/atlanta-mayor-kasim-reed-speaks-up-for-tsplost-%E2%80%98just-surviving-means-just-surviving%E2%80%99/\n\nThe Atlanta Journal-Constitution, \"Expect to see more new homes in 2011,\" Feb. 16, 2011, http://www.ajc.com/business/expect-to-see-more-839525.html\n\nU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics State and Area Employment Georgia database, http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/surveymost?sm+13", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
