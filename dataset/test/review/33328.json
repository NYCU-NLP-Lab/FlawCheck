["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "Nothing suggests a boondoggle like tens of millions of federal dollars spent on office upgrades for politicians.\n\nAt least that\u2019s the impression left by an advertisement that started running in Virginia this month.\n\nThe spot, which takes aim at Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Tim Kaine, comes from Crossroads Global Policy Studies, a Republican-aligned advocacy group.\n\nThe ad shows footage of Tim Kaine referring to stimulus funding passed under president Barack Obama.\n\n\"The stimulus is critically important to put people back to work,\" Kaine says.\n\nThen, with no small hint of sarcasm, the ad says stimulus money went to \"critically important projects\" such as \"office upgrades for politicians.\" The 35-second spot then lists $39 million as the price tag of that endeavor.\n\nNate Hodson, a spokesman for Crossroads GPS, told us in an e-mail that his group\u2019s claim is a reference to the latest phase of a renovation of the Kansas state capitol building.\n\nThis is a familiar claim for PolitiFact, which debunked a similar charge that surfaced in the 2010 New Hampshire U.S. Senate race.\n\nSince it\u2019s popping up again, we decided to weigh in on it once more.\n\nHodson pointed to a July 7, 2010, story in The Bond Buyer, which notes the state took out a $39.7 million Build America Bond to help pay for the the latest phase of a decade-long renovation of the capitol. But that doesn\u2019t mean, as the ad implies, that $39 million of federal stimulus money was spent directly on the project.\n\n\"That\u2019s not the case at all,\" said Marilyn Jacobson, a spokeswoman for the Kansas Department of Administration, which oversees the capitol building.\n\nThe Build America Bonds were created as part of the 2009 stimulus -- the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. A U.S. Treasury Department summary notes that the federal government pays 35 percent of the interest costs on the bonds, and the state or local government issuing the bond pays the rest of the interest.\n\nThe idea is to give states a lower interest rate and thereby boost infrastructure projects and the economy.\n\nThe state sells the bond to investors, and it\u2019s the state -- not the federal government -- that pays back the principal on the bond, Jacobson said.\n\nThe costs for the federal government to finance its share of the interest over the life of the bond -- which matures in 2030 -- would be a fraction of the $39 million cited in the ad.\n\nJim MacMurray, vice president of finance at the Kansas Development Finance Authority, estimated the federal government\u2019s total cost of paying for its share of interest would come to $8.8 million over the life of the 20-year bond.\n\nThere\u2019s another problem with the Crossroads claim -- the contention that this is simply a project to \"upgrade politicians\u2019 offices.\"\n\nIt\u2019s true that office space renovations have been part of the project. But Jacobson said that\u2019s just one part of an overall restoration to completely overhaul the state capitol, which is more than 100 years old. Work includes replacing the leaky limestone exterior, installing new heating and air conditioning systems as well as getting rid of century-old electrical wiring, she said.\n\n\"Office space is a very small piece of the whole thing,\" Jacobson said.\n\nOur ruling\n\nThe Crossroads ad says that $39 million in stimulus money went to \"office upgrades for politicians,\" a reference to the latest phase in renovating the Kansas state capitol building.\n\nFirst of all, the $39 million is not a direct payment for the renovation. That\u2019s the amount the state will repay along with most of the interest through a bond program started by the 2009 stimulus.\n\nThe federal government pays for some interest costs, but those expenses are nowhere near $39 million.\n\nAlthough it\u2019s true that office upgrades are part of the project, new offices are just one part of a much bigger project to completely restore the building.\n\nWe rate the claim Mostly False.", "Crossroads Grassroots Policy Strategies, \"Crossroads GPS: \u2018Applause\u2019 VA,\" November 10, 2011.\n\nCrossroads Grassroots Policy Strategies, \"Crossroads GPS launches new TV ads on economy, spending in five Senate states,\" November 10, 2011.\n\nE-mail from Nate Hodson, Crossroads GPS director of state and regional media relations, November 11, 2011.\n\nBond Buyer, \"Kansas using BABs for statehouse project,\" July 7, 2010.\n\nPolitiFact, \"Ants in the stimulus?
