But is it true that Cortez Masto pushed out Uber and drove away jobs in 2014?", "No free rides", "Uber didn\u2019t have the smoothest ride into Nevada.", "Speculation around the company launching was running rampant in 2014 as Uber eyed Nevada and tourist-friendly Las Vegas as one of the most lucrative markets without ride-hailing companies operating (Uber considered Nevada in 2012 but backed out).", "But Uber\u2019s normal strategy of legally questionable, high-profile launches was a more difficult bar to clear in Nevada, where the closely-regulated taxi market is ruled by incredibly strict regulations. The rules include an explicit prohibition in state law on any company entering the market unless it can prove it wouldn\u2019t \"adversely affect other carriers operating in the territory.\"", "Nevada also has a confusing regulatory structure for overseeing cab drivers. The Nevada Taxicab Authority oversees Las Vegas, while the Transportation Authority regulates the rest of the state. Both regulators fall under the Department of Business and Industry, which Director Bruce Breslow said attempted to negotiate Uber\u2019s entry into the market before it suddenly launched statewide on Oct. 24, 2014.", "\"In the middle of trying to help them, they decided to operate without authority and illegally at the time in Nevada,\" Breslow said.", "Despite being told by regulators that Uber would need to apply under existing rules for new taxi companies, the company argued its non-traditional business model didn\u2019t fall under decades-old state regulations.", "State officials disagreed, and quickly cracked down. Uber drivers caught by regulators were immediately cited and their cars impounded, and the Attorney General\u2019s office quickly filed suit to shut Uber down.", "In an interview, a spokesman for Freedom Partners said Cortez Masto\u2019s \"overaggressive legal fight\" justified the ad.", "\"The reality is that Uber was operating in the absence of regulations, not in spite of them, and the state Legislature ultimately codified what Nevadans already knew: Uber is not a taxi company and should not be subject to their regulations,\" spokesman Bill Riggs said in an email.", "So how much wiggle room did Cortez Masto have in going after Uber, and was her legal strategy as overzealous as the ad claims?", "Jurisdictional fights", "The ad claims Cortez Masto went after Uber \"three times\" until the company was driven out of the state \u2014 a reference to three attempted requests for temporary restraining orders filed on the same day Uber launched.", "The requests, which were filed in Carson City, Reno and Las Vegas, created a legal mess with several justices attempting to claim the case, including one Las Vegas-based justice suggesting that the Attorney General\u2019s office was \"jumping around to different jurisdictions trying to get a ruling.\"", "Nevada\u2019s state Supreme Court eventually ruled on the jurisdictional fight, sending the case to a Reno district court, which promptly granted an injunction against Uber (the company soon after \"temporarily suspended operations\").", "Freedom Partners claims this \"overaggressive legal fight\" drove Uber out of the state and cost jobs, but the truth is more complicated.", "Former Chief Deputy Attorney General Gina Session oversaw the Uber case. She said the office filed in three courts because they were pressed for time and weren't totally sure if an injunction filed in one jurisdiction would apply statewide \u2014 especially because Nevada has two geographically-based regulatory bodies covering the taxi industry.
