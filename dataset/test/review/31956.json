["By Saranac Hale Spencer", "Posted on September 24, 2020", "A clip from a television interview with former Vice President Joe Biden is circulating online with the false claim that he is reading from a teleprompter. Actually, Biden was looking at a screen showing a viewer\u2019s question before he looks at the interviewer in the room with him.", "A bogus claim that Joe Biden, Democratic nominee for president, was reading off of a teleprompter during a recent television interview has been viewed widely online.", "It got a boost when the president\u2019s second son, Eric Trump, shared it on Twitter, along with a clip from the interview with Jos\u00e9 D\u00edaz-Balart on Noticias Telemundo. The claim is written in large text above the clip, saying: \u201cBiden caught red-handed using a teleprompter.\u201d", "President Donald Trump later retweeted the claim.", "But it\u2019s clear from the full interview that Biden wasn\u2019t looking at a teleprompter. He was looking at a screen showing a Telemundo viewer asking about deportation policy during the Obama administration. Biden began to answer her question while facing the screen.", "D\u00edaz-Balart then interjected, clarifying that Biden had pledged to halt deportations during his first 100 days in office. Biden responded, saying, \u201cfreeze deportations for the first 100 days and then \u2014 and only people who will be deported are people who committed a felony while here.\u201d", "Biden then appears to look back toward the screen, saying, \u201cOK, I lost that lady,\u201d in reference to the viewer who had asked the initial question.", "The viral post has misquoted that phrase, claiming in text below the video clip that Biden said, \u201cOK, I lost that line.\u201d", "It\u2019s hard to hear that part of the video, but D\u00edaz-Balart explained what happened to Politico. He said, \u201cIn one moment the monitor went to black,\u201d and Biden said, \u201c\u2018I lost the lady.'\u201d", "\u201cI told him he could answer looking at me,\u201d D\u00edaz-Balart told Politico, \u201cand that was that.\u201d", "Indeed, in the video, D\u00edaz-Balart follows Biden\u2019s remark, saying, \u201cYeah, well, but that\u2019s good, because we can talk, you and I, on that.\u201d", "The video below shows that part of the broadcast:", "This falsehood feeds into Trump\u2019s frequently repeated criticism that Biden uses teleprompters, but it\u2019s worth noting that Trump has had his own issues with them\u00a0over the years. In 2019, for example, he\u00a0told\u00a0an Independence Day crowd that \u201cOur Army\u2026 took over the airports\u201d during the Revolutionary War, a flub that he later\u00a0blamed\u00a0on the teleprompter going \u201ckaput.\u201d", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.

Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
