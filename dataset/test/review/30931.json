["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on October 9, 2020", "Q: Was Sen. Kamala Harris\u2019 story at the vice presidential debate about President Abraham Lincoln\u2019s 1864 Supreme Court vacancy correct?", "A: There\u2019s no evidence that Lincoln said he delayed the nomination to let voters choose the next president, as Harris said.", "At the vice presidential debate, Sen. Kamala Harris invoked a bit of Civil War-era history by offering the purported words of \u201cHonest Abe\u201d about filling a Supreme Court vacancy just before a presidential election. The tale was intended to bolster Democrats\u2019 argument that the current Supreme Court vacancy should be filled by the winner of the 2020 election.", "Many readers have asked us whether her story about President Abraham Lincoln holds up.", "While Harris got the basic facts about the timing of the vacancy, she attributed an unsubstantiated quote to the 16th president and advanced an unproven claim about his motivations.", "Here\u2019s what Harris said:", "Harris, Oct. 7: In 1864, one of the, I think political heroes, certainly the President, I assume of you also, Mr. Vice President, is Abraham Lincoln. Abraham Lincoln was up for reelection and it was 27 days before the election. And a seat became open on the United States Supreme Court. Abraham Lincoln\u2019s party was in charge, not only of the White House, but the Senate. But Honest Abe said it\u2019s not the right thing to do. The American people deserve to make the decision about who will be the next president of the United States. And then that person can select who will serve for a lifetime on the highest court of our land.", "It\u2019s true that a Supreme Court vacancy occurred just 27 days before the 1864 election, when Chief Justice Robert B. Taney died on Oct. 12. Taney was known for offering the decision in the 1857 Dred Scott case, which had declared that Black people, slaves or free, were not U.S. citizens.", "And it\u2019s true that, while Lincoln\u2019s Republican party controlled the Senate, he didn\u2019t make a nomination until after he was reelected. Lincoln nominated Salmon Chase for chief justice in December 1864. Chase had served as Lincoln\u2019s Treasury secretary and had vied for the Republican presidential nomination against Lincoln in 1860.", "But Lincoln\u2019s exact rationale for waiting to nominate Chase until after the election isn\u2019t clear \u2014 and there is no record of him making a quote that squares with the one Harris described \u2014 according to historians.", "\u201cLincoln never actually explained the delay in his own words, so we don\u2019t know his motivation,\u201d Christian McWhirter,\u00a0Lincoln Historian at the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum, told us in an email.", "McWhirter continued: \u201cHistory is, of course, all about interpretation, so historians have mostly relied on context to draw conclusions. The 1864 election is certainly important context, as is the fact that the Senate was out of session until December 5. Things like that can provide clues for what Lincoln might have been thinking, but ultimately we can never know exactly.\u201d", "Congress, as McWhirter noted, was not in session when the vacancy arose \u2014 which means the Senate couldn\u2019t have confirmed Lincoln\u2019s selection until after the election, anyway. The Senate ultimately confirmed Chase a day after returning (and the same day Lincoln formally nominated him) on Dec. 6.", "Historian Michael Burlingame in his book, \u201cAbraham Lincoln: A Life,\u201d wrote that \u201cupon hearing the news\u201d of Taney\u2019s death \u201cLincoln said he would not nominate a replacement for Taney right away but would remain \u2018shut pan\u2019 for a while. Preoccupied with the election and his annual message, he postponed consideration of the matter until Congress met in December. In the meantime, he said that \u2018he was waiting to receive expressions of public opinion from the Country.'\u201d Burlingame, however, describes \u201csuch expressions\u201d as letters about who to choose \u2014 not the results of the election.", "In \u201cRecollections of President Lincoln and His Administration,\u201d Lincoln\u2019s Register of Treasury, Lucius E. Chittenden, wrote that Lincoln had said earlier that year \u2014 in June, when Chase stepped down from Treasury secretary \u2014 that, if given the opportunity, \u201cI will make him Chief Justice of the United States.\u201d (Taney had been ill for some time.) Chittenden also wrote that Lincoln \u201chad never contemplated any other\u201d person for that vacancy.", "The Trump campaign rejected Harris\u2019 claim, too, citing historian and novelist Shelby Foote\u2019s suggestion that Lincoln delayed nominating with a political calculation in mind: to ensure Chase\u2019s \u201cfervent support\u201d leading up to the election.", "Likewise, the Washington Post wrote: \u201cThe overarching effect of the delay is that it held Lincoln\u2019s broad but shaky coalition of conservative and radical Republicans together. And it kept rivals like Chase in line.\u201d", "McWhirter said that whether such a political calculation was a factor in \u201cpotentially delaying the nomination is \u2026 open to interpretation.\u201d", "Also, since Lincoln won reelection, it\u2019s unknown whether he would have nominated someone after the election\u00a0even if he had not beaten George McClellan.", "\u201cI don\u2019t think we have a clear statement from Lincoln one way or the other\u201d on that, McWhirter said.", "We fact-checked a number of claims made during the vice presidential debate.
