["By Robert Farley", "Posted on September 16, 2016", "In a speech in Michigan, Tim Kaine cherry-picked the words of his Republican opponents, Donald Trump and Mike Pence, to leave a misleading impression of their public statements on military service members and white nationalist David Duke.", "Kaine made his comments during a speech in Michigan on Sept. 13. In both cases, Trump and Pence uttered the words Kaine attributed to them. But in both cases, Kaine left out key context.", "The Michigan speech was not the first time Kaine has criticized Trump for describing the military as \u201ca disaster.\u201d Kaine has pointed out this quote, which Trump made in a January primary debate, in numerous interviews and speeches.", "Here\u2019s what Kaine said in Michigan:", "Kaine, Sept. 13: Donald Trump has a different approach. Donald Trump, on the military, repeatedly he has said, quote, \u201cThe American military is a disaster.\u201d Now as a Blue Star family, when you hear somebody dissing 2\u00a0million young men and women who volunteer in time of war, risking their lives and their health, and just saying, well, they\u2019re a disaster, it infuriates me.", "Blue Star families are those that have members serving in the military. Kaine is a Blue Star parent because his eldest son, Nathaniel, is a U.S. Marine.", "But was Trump \u201cdissing\u201d the men and women who serve in the military when he said,\u00a0\u201cOur military is a disaster\u201d? Here\u2019s the context of his comment.", "Trump, Jan. 14: I\u2019m very angry because our country is being run horribly and I will gladly accept the mantle of anger. Our military is a disaster. Our healthcare is a horror show. Obamacare, we\u2019re going to repeal it and replace it. We have no borders. Our vets are being treated horribly. Illegal immigration is beyond belief. Our country is being run by incompetent people. And yes, I am angry. And I won\u2019t be angry when we fix it, but until we fix it, I\u2019m very, very angry.", "If those were Trump\u2019s only words on the matter, perhaps his meaning would be unclear. But on numerous occasions, both before and after that debate, Trump has made it clear that he is not criticizing the men and women who serve in the military, but rather elected officials who he says have left the military \u201cdepleted.\u201d", "For example, in remarks at a National Guard Association convention on Sept. 12, Trump made clear that his beef is with elected leaders who he believes have underfunded the military and left it \u201cdepleted,\u201d not with active military members, who he called \u201cthe greatest men and women on earth.\u201d", "Trump, Sept. 12: My plan calls for a major rebuilding of the entire military and the elimination of the defense \u2014 and we have to do this so quickly, it\u2019s a disaster \u2014 of the defense sequester. It is a disaster. Have no choice, it is a disaster. It\u2019s called depletion. We have been depleted as a military, we can\u2019t let that happen. The greatest men and women on Earth, but we have been depleted by what\u2019s taken place.", "In a speech in North Carolina the same day, Trump referred to military members as \u201cheroes\u201d who are \u201ca permanent testament to the courage and character of our nation.\u201d", "During the NBC \u201ccommander-in-chief forum\u201d\u00a0on Sept. 7, Trump again made clear that when he criticizes the military, he is not disparaging the members serving in the military.", "Trump, Sept. 7: We have a depleted military. We have the greatest people in the world in our military. But it is very sadly depleted.", "Trump\u2019s criticism of military funding has been a steady theme throughout his campaign, both before and after his comment in question at the debate.", "For example, Trump said in an interview on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d on Sept. 20, 2015, several months before the \u201cdisaster\u201d comment at the debate, \u201cOur military is not the same as it was, obviously. It\u2019s being depleted. I see it in the real estate business all the time. I\u2019m getting listings for Army bases and naval bases and everything. They\u2019re selling so much \u2014 so many things in so many places. And I say to myself, what\u2019s going on?\u201d", "Trump had used similar language \u2014 that the military is \u201cdepleted\u201d \u2014 going back to at least August 2015.", "The Clinton-Kaine\u00a0campaign told us that some could interpret Trump\u2019s debate comment about the military as a slight to active service members, because he did not clarify that he was not talking about military members. And certainly some service members may be offended by Trump\u2019s assessment of the military\u2019s capability. But Trump\u2019s comments both before that debate and numerous times since then have made it clear that Trump\u2019s criticism is not of military members, but of the military condition due to funding.", "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/5d40c83b-cfe1-4ba4-9f91-19b08b04d2b1", "In a defense of Clinton\u2019s comment that half of Trump\u2019s supporters are a \u201cbasket of deplorables,\u201d Kaine also misleadingly cherry-picked comments from Pence about David Duke, a former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard now running for U.S. Senate.", "Duke has said he supports Trump\u2019s candidacy, and he has praised a number of Trump\u2019s policy positions, including on immigration. He told his listeners in a February radio interview\u00a0that \u201cvoting against Donald Trump at this point is really treason to your heritage.\u201d", "Kaine seized on that support as evidence that some who support Trump do in fact fall into that \u201cdeplorable\u201d category mentioned by Clinton. Kaine said Clinton \u201cadvanced the notion that if you\u2019re chumming around with the head of the Ku Klux Klan or people that have that tie, that\u2019s deplorable. You\u2019ve got to call that out.\u201d", "Kaine, Sept. 13: And so Donald Trump says, well, that \u2014 you know, how insulting of Hillary to make that point. And so last night, on a news program, Wolf Blitzer asked his running mate, so is David Duke, you know, with all his connections with the Ku Klux Klan, is David Duke deplorable? Quote, \u201cI don\u2019t want to get into the name-calling business.\u201d", "If you cannot call out bigotry, if you cannot call out racism, xenophobia, it\u2019s \u2014 if you can\u2019t call it out and you stand back and you\u2019re silent around it, you\u2019re enabling it to grow.", "It\u2019s true that in an interview on CNN on Sept. 13, Blitzer asked Pence if he would call David Duke \u201cdeplorable,\u201d and Pence replied, \u201cI\u2019m not in the name-calling business.\u201d", "But Pence wasn\u2019t \u201csilent\u201d about Duke in the interview. Pence also said, \u201cDonald Trump has denounced David Duke repeatedly. We don\u2019t want his support and we don\u2019t want the support of people who think like him.\u201d", "Here\u2019s the exchange:", "Blitzer, Sept. 13: But she said there are supporters \u2014 and you know this \u2014 there are some supporters of Donald Trump and Mike Pence who \u2014 like David Duke for example, and some other white nationalists, who would fit into that category of deplorables, right?", "Pence: Well, as I\u2019ve told you the last time I was on, I\u2019m not really sure why the media keeps dropping David Duke\u2019s name. Donald Trump has denounced David Duke repeatedly. We don\u2019t want his support and we don\u2019t want the support of people who think like him.", "Blitzer: So you\u2019d call him a deplorable? You would call him that?", "Pence: Well, that \u2014 no. I don\u2019t \u2014 I\u2019m not in the name-calling business, Wolf. You know me better than that. What Hillary Clinton did Friday night was shocking. I mean the \u2014 the millions of people who support Donald Trump around this country are not a basket of anything. They are Americans. And they deserve the respect of the Democrat nominee for president of the United States.", "People are free to take issue with Pence\u2019s decision not to characterize Duke as \u201cdeplorable.\u201d Republican Sen. Mike Lee, who has refused to endorse Trump, was among those who chastised Pence for not calling Duke\u2019s views deplorable. But when Kaine singles out Pence\u2019s comment about not wanting to name call, but omits Pence\u2019s denunciation of Duke, it leaves a misleading impression of Pence\u2019s public stance.", "As for Kaine\u2019s comment, \u201cif you\u2019re chumming around with the head of the Ku Klux Klan or people that have that tie, that\u2019s deplorable,\u201d the\u00a0campaign told us he was referring to Duke, though he was not implying that Trump himself has been \u201cchumming around\u201d with Duke, only that some of Trump\u2019s supporters have.", "Trump repeatedly has been asked about David Duke. In one of the first instances during the campaign, Trump told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper that he didn\u2019t know anything about Duke. As we wrote then, that\u2019s nonsense. We found instances of Trump criticizing Duke in 1991 and again in 2000, when he called Duke, \u201ca bigot, a racist, a problem.\u201d Trump later said he had an issue with a \u201cbad earpiece\u201d in the CNN interview, and he has since repeatedly disavowed Duke, and renounced support from any white supremacists.", "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/50ad650f-5c5c-4281-afb6-04a9b102d847", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
