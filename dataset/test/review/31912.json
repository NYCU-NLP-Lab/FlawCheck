["About this rating", "The Shields brothers traveled with P.T. Barnum's circus as the \"Texas Giants.\"", "The four Shields brothers were all nearly 8 feet tall.", "In January 2016, a photograph posted to the image-sharing web site Imgur renewed interest in the Shields brothers, four men from Texas who made a living as sideshow performers in a circus due to their unusual heights.", "While the Shields brothers really did travel with Barnum & Bailey in the 1880s, and while it's also true that they were billed as the \"Texas Giants,\" their height\u00a0has been a matter of dispute between relatives, historians, and P.T. Barnum.", "As shown in the above-displayed images, the Shields brothers were billed as standing between 7\u00a0feet 8 inches\u00a0and just a quarter-inch shy of 8\u00a0feet tall. A description of Jack Shields from Getty Images states that all of the brothers were \"eight feet tall\":", "Jack Shields, the Texas Giant (1859-1896), the youngest of four brothers who were all eight feet tall. They were paid $100 a week by P. T. Barnum to appear as the Texas Giants in his travelling circus.", "Frank Shields' granddaughter Martha, however,\u00a0disputed these claims in an article written for\u00a0Slideshow World.\u00a0For instance,\u00a0Martha wrote that Shade, the shortest man in the above-displayed photo, was only 6 feet 6 inches tall.", "Martha explained that P.T. Barnum used platform shoes, tall hats, and a deceptively small ruler to make it seem as if the Shields Brothers were much taller than they actually were:", "The photo on the cover of the Texas Giants Book\u00a0has \"Shade\" (b. Dec. 1, 1855) age 18, 7' 8\"; \"Guss\" (b. ca. 1852) age 24,\u00a0 7' 10\"; \"Frank\" (b. September 27, 1853) age 24, 7' 11 1/4\", Jack (b. August 21, 1859) age 20, 7' 11 1/4\".\u00a0 It appears the ages and heights were not accurate, P.T. Barnum may have made Shade the youngest as he was the shortest of the Shields Giants. None of the Giants were as tall as PT Barnum's ruler made them appear.", "They wore built up shoes, tall hats and PT Barnum's rule did not have the full 12\" per foot. Only one descendant of the giants was 7' tall and that is Frank's grandson Marcus Ross Freiberger, my Aunt Varina Shields Freiberger's son.", "An article in the\u00a0Reading Eagle\u00a0on 26 December 1926 backed up Martha's assertion that Shade Shields' height had been exaggerated:", "It's true that four brothers who were above-average in height were billed as \"The Texas Giants\" and traveled as sideshow performers in the 1880s. However, while the circus claimed that the performers were all close to 8\u00a0feet tall, it appears that their actual heights were \"only\" between 6\u00a0feet 6 inches and\u00a07 feet.", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
