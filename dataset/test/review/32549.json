North Dakota\u2019s Game and Fish department doesn\u2019t allow a person to hold two residential licenses.

But voting will not cost anyone their hunting licenses. People with out-of-state hunting licenses get to keep their licenses; the warning only applies to people with residential licenses in another state who recently moved to North Dakota.
