["About this rating", "Voting in the 2020 U.S. Election may be over, but the misinformation keeps on ticking. Never stop fact-checking. Follow our post-election coverage here.", "One of the staples of press conferences and rallies held by U.S. President Donald Trump in 2020 was his attempts to deflect criticism of his leadership during the COVID-19 pandemic by asserting that he imposed a ban on travel from China in February over the objections of nearly everyone else -- particularly over the objections of Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID).", "For example, during a Fox News Business interview with Maria Bartiromo in May, Trump maintained that, \"When I closed the border to China, [Fauci] disagreed with that,\" and his decision to restrict travel to the U.S. from China was \u201ccriticized by everybody, including Dr. Fauci\u201d:", "And during a July interview with Greta Van Susteren, Trump claimed that Fauci and other \"experts\" had told him, \"Don't close off China. Don't ban China,\" but he imposed a ban over their advice:", "I disagree with him. Dr. Fauci said don't wear masks and now he says wear them. And he said numerous things. Don't close off China. Don't ban China. I did it anyway. I didn't listen to my experts and I banned China. We would have been in much worse shape. You wouldn't believe the number of deaths more we would have had if we didn't do the ban.", "But comments made by Fauci -- and Trump himself -- at the time the China travel restriction was implemented (and afterwards) contradict Trump's later claims.", "It is true that after participating in a Jan. 24 briefing on Capitol Hill (when only a small handful of COVID-19 coronavirus disease cases had been reported in the U.S.), Fauci said both he and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) director Robert Redfield told senators that imposing travel restrictions was \"not a good idea at this time\" and averred it \"would create a lot of disruption economically and otherwise and it wouldn't necessarily have a positive effect.\"  He also stated that a travel ban wasn't something that was being considered at the time:", "Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) has gone further than most, sending a letter to the Trump administration asking whether travel from affected areas in China to the United States should be restricted or banned.", "Leaving the briefing, Hawley said officials told senators they don\u2019t think that step is necessary right now but that they had not closed the door on it.", "\u201cThey don\u2019t think travel restrictions, where we just say we're not going to allow people in, they don\u2019t think that that\u2019s necessary quite yet, but they're monitoring it, they're seeing what the spread is like,\u201d Hawley said.", "But Fauci told reporters after the briefing that a travel ban is not on the table.", "\u201cIt\u2019s not something that I think we're even considering,\u201d Fauci said.", "But by Jan. 31, the day that the travel restrictions were announced, Fauci spoke supportively of them during a press briefing:", "There are a number of countries outside of China that have travel-related cases.  And now what we\u2019re seeing is that there are secondary cases from them, and, as [CDC director Dr. Robert Redfield] mentioned, we also have that in this country.  The WHO has issued, as you know, a Public Health Emergency of International Concern declaration.", "If you put all these things together, I underscore what Bob said: We still have a low risk to the American public, but we want to keep it at a low risk.  And because there are so many unknowns here, we\u2019re going to take the action that the Secretary [of HHS] will describe, in a temporary way, to make sure we mitigate, as best as we possibly can, this risk.  Thank you.", "Three days later, during an interview with CNBC, Fauci again spoke supportively of the China travel restrictions, referring to them as part of \u201cgood public health measures\u201d:", "Fauci credits \u201cgood public health measures\u201d in the United States for helping to stop \u201csustained transmission\u201d of the virus in America.", "\u201cAs the entry into the United States of potentially infected people is diminished because of the travel restrictions on both sides ... I think you are going to see a dampening down\u201d of U.S. cases, he added.", "A week after the China travel ban was enacted, The Hill quoted Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) Alex Azar as saying that the travel restrictions were \"the uniform recommendations of the career public health officials at HHS\" (which includes Fauci's NIAID) and also quoted Fauci as stating that \"the positives [of the travel ban] outweigh the negatives\":", "\u201cThe travel restrictions that we put in place in consultation with the president were very measured and incremental,\u201d Alex Azar, secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), told reporters. \u201cThese were the uniform recommendations of the career public health officials here at HHS.\u201d", "Anthony Fauci, head of the infectious disease division at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), said the U.S. restrictions are not a perfect solution, but the positives outweigh the negatives.", "\u201cThis is a temporary thing. We're not talking about something that's permanent, so we recognize the potential negatives of it, but this decision was not made lightly,\u201d he said.", "During another press briefing at the end of February, Fauci again spoke of the importance of the travel restrictions in helping to contain the spread of COVID-19:", "I hearken back to the original decision that was made by the President of making sure that we knew the scenario that was going on in China.  We prevented travel from China to the United States.  If we had not done that, we would have had many, many more cases right here that we would have to be dealing with.", "In a Feb. 28 appearance on Fox Business' \"Lou Dobbs Tonight,\" Fauci again emphasized the importance of the China travel restriction in limiting COVID-19 cases in the U.S.:", "We've done really quite well thus far, and I think one of the reasons why is that what we did early on was that travel restriction from China, preventing a lot of people who are infected, particularly from Wuhan, from coming into the country. Which really made the total number of cases, starting off, really quite low.", "According to a March 2020 Wall Street Journal article, it was HHS health officials (including Fauci) who had to convince Trump to agree to the China travel ban, not the other way around:", "The president also spent weeks playing down the disease. On Feb. 26, he told reporters that there were only 15 people infected and the total \u201cwithin a couple days is going to be down to close to zero.\u201d", "He also was reluctant to sign off on the first virus-related travel ban aimed at China, concerned about the signal it would send to markets and his relationship with President Xi Jinping, aides said. He eventually agreed to it on the advice of Mr. Azar, aides said, and now touts it as one of his proudest actions during the crisis.", "Similarly, The New York Times reported in March 2020 that Trump had been \"skeptical\" about imposing travel restrictions, but he was convinced of the necessity for action by public health officials, including Fauci:", "By Thursday, Jan. 30, public health officials had come around [to take the step of banning travel from China]. Mr. Azar, Dr. Redfield and Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, agreed that a ban on travel from the epidemic\u2019s center could buy some time to put into place prevention and testing measures. \u201cThere was so much we didn\u2019t know about this virus,\u201d Dr. Redfield said in an interview. \u201cWe were rapidly understanding it was much more transmissible, that it had a great ability to go global.\u201d", "The debate moved that afternoon to the Oval Office, where Mr. Azar and others urged the president to approve the ban. \u201cThe situation has changed radically,\u201d Mr. Azar told Mr. Trump.", "Others in the room urged being more cautious, arguing that a ban could have unforeseen consequences. \u201cThis is unprecedented,\u201d warned Kellyanne Conway, the president\u2019s counselor. Mr. Trump was skeptical, though he would later claim that everyone around him had been against the idea.", "The president sided with his more aggressive aides, and announced the ban next day.", "During an April 13 Coronavirus Task Force press briefing, Fauci said that he (and others) had recommended the China travel restriction to Trump, and at that same briefing, Trump averred that he and Fauci had been \"on the same page\" about dealing with the COVID-19 threat \"from the beginning\":", "FAUCI: The travel [restriction] was another recommendation, when we went in and said, \u201cWe probably should be doing that.\u201d  And the answer was \u201cyes.\u201d  And then another time was, \u201cWe should do it with Europe,\u201d and the answer was \u201cyes.\u201d  And the next time, \u201cWe should do it with the UK,\u201d and the answer was \u201cyes\" ... There wasn\u2019t anybody saying, \u201cNo, you shouldn\u2019t do that.\u201d", "Q: To be clear, you and Dr. Fauci are on the same page?", "THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah, we have been from the beginning.", "In short, all the available public comments by Fauci about the imposition of China travel restrictions, as well as press reporting on that issue, indicate that the NIAID director was a consistent advocate and supporter of the travel ban from the beginning, not an opponent or critic of it.  Moreover, comments from government officials and White House aides referenced in press accounts suggest that it was Trump himself, not Fauci, who initially expressed resistance to imposing the travel restrictions -- only several months after the fact did the president begin contradicting his earlier statements and asserting that he had agreed to the ban despite objections and criticism from Fauci and \"everybody else.\"", "Weixel, Nathaniel and Peter Sullivan. \u00a0 \"Top Health Officials Brief Senators on Coronavirus as Infections Spread.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The Hill. \u00a0 24 January 2020.", "Bender, Michael C. \u00a0 \"Coronavirus Crisis Tests Trump\u2019s Unusual Governing Style.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The Wall Street Journal. \u00a0 12 March 2020.", "Shear, Michael D. et al. \u00a0 \"Inside Trump Administration, Debate Raged Over What to Tell Public.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The New York Times. \u00a0 7 March 2020.", "Weixel, Nathaniel. \u00a0 \"Trump Health Officials Defend Coronavirus Quarantine, Travel Restrictions.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The Hill. \u00a0 7 February 2020.", "WhiteHouse.gov. \u00a0 \"Press Briefing by Members of the President\u2019s Coronavirus Task Force.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 31 January 2020.", "Bursztynsky, Jessica. \u00a0 \"NIH Doctor Says 25% of Coronavirus Cases in China Are \u2018Very Serious,\u2019 Requiring \u2018Intensive Care.\u2019\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 CNBC. \u00a0 3 February 2020.", "WhiteHouse.gov. \u00a0 \"Remarks by President Trump, Vice President Pence, and Members of the Coronavirus Task Force in Press Conference.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 29 February 2020.", "Full Court Press. \u00a0 \"Gray Television\u2019s Greta Van Susteren Interviews President Trump.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 7 July 2020.", "S&P Global. \u00a0 \"Senators Suggest Coronavirus Travel Ban, Emergency; GOP Briefs Timeline Denied.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 27 January 2020.", "Jarrett, Gregg. \u00a0 \"Lou Dobbs Tonight.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Fox Business. \u00a0 28 Febaury 2020.", "David Mikkelson founded the site now known as snopes.com back in 1994.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
