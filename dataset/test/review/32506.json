["In a recent fact-check, India Today claimed that a tweet attributed to Gajendra Chauhan, actor and former chairman of the Film and Television Institute of India (FTII), is fake. The channel claimed that the morphed screenshot reads, \u201cI Am With Shringi Yadav. Nation With A Nationalist. #IStandWithShringiYadav,\u201d but Chauhan has so far not tweeted anything on the incident.
