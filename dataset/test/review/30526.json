["About this rating", "An early October 2016 audio leak of Donald Trump's making lewd comments about women became a huge political controversy, and several subsequent articles suggested a callous Trump divorced his first wife, Ivana, wholly or in part because he didn't like her breast implants.", "A 1 October 2016 piece published in the Economist (its claim reiterated by the Washington Post) held that:", "Until this year, a conservative record on questions of faith and personal morality was a prerequisite for winning the Republican nomination. During the 2012 primaries there was speculation about whether Mr Romney\u2019s quiet Mormon faith would put off such values voters. In 2016 this has all been erased. When Mr Trump divorced the first of his three wives, Ivana, he let the New York tabloids know that one reason for the separation was that her breast implants felt all wrong.", "The claim was not new in October 2016. In September and March 2016 respectively, the Atlantic and the National Review had referenced details of Trump's purported leaking lewd criticism of his then-wife's enhancements to \"New York tabloids\":", "The people closest to Trump have painful experience with this same quality. In September 1990, Marie Brenner wrote at length in Vanity Fair about how the billionaire humiliated Ivana Trump.", "Conservative writer Mona Charen reflected on the same era in National Review:", "I first became aware of Donald Trump when he chose to make cheating on his first wife front-page news. Donald and Ivana Trump broke up over the course of months. Not that divorce is shocking, mind you. Among the glitterati marriage seems more unusual. Nor is infidelity exactly novel.", "But it requires a particular breed of lowlife to advertise the sexual superiority of one\u2019s mistress over the mother of one\u2019s children. That was Trump\u2019s style. He leaked stories to the New York tabloids about Ivana\u2019s breast implants \u2014 they didn\u2019t feel right. Marla Maples, by contrast, suited him better. She, proving her suitability for the man she was eager to steal from his family, told the papers that her encounters with the mogul were \u201cthe best sex I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d It wasn\u2019t just Donald Trump\u2019s betrayal that caught my eye, nor just the tawdriness \u2014 it was the cruelty.", "The rumor has taken several forms. For example, a profile of Ivana Trump published in March 2016 maintained that her former husband had insulted her breasts while he was speaking to a reporter:", "But life with The Donald did not improve, and it is agonizing to imagine that final, grim year when he was otherwise engaged and she was alone with the perfect new breasts he paid for but told a reporter he would never touch. What did she do in the small hours? Did she pace her triplex\u2019s onyx floors or sit rigid in a Queen Anne chair, staring blankly at the handpainted, gold-leafed ceiling?", "And back in 1990, Vanity Fair's coverage of the then-recent Trump split told a story not dissimilar from the one circulating more than a quarter-century later:", "Trump seemed extraordinarily concerned that [Ivana] sign the [nuptial agreement] papers, perhaps because an Atlantic City photographer was threatening to blackmail him with photos he had taken of him and Marla Maples ... The tactics he used in business he now brought home. \u201cDonald began calling Ivana and screaming all the time: \u2018You don\u2019t know what you are doing!\u2019 \u201d one of Ivana\u2019s top assistants told me. \u201cWhen Ivana would hang up the phone, I would say, \u2018How can you put up with this?\u2019 and Ivana would say, \u2018Because Donald is right.\u2019 \u201d He began belittling her: \u201cThat dress is terrible.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re showing too much cleavage.\u201d \u201cYou never spend enough time with the children.\u201d \u201cWho would touch those plastic breasts?\u201d Ivana told her friends that Donald had stopped sleeping with her. She blamed herself. \u201cI think it was Donald\u2019s master plan to get rid of Ivana in Atlantic City,\u201d one of her assistants told me. \u201cBy then, Marla Maples was in a suite at the Trump Regency. Atlantic City was to be their playground.\u201d", "Ultimately, the oft-repeated claim was two-fold: in part, it maintained that Trump was anywhere between recoiling from and publicly leaking disparaging comments about his own wife's augmented breasts to \"the New York tabloids.\" The second layer of the rumor held Trump separated from Ivana because her breasts were \"all wrong.\" In some versions, Trump is merely quoted as making the off-color remarks with no mention of how that information was obtained. In others, Trump is said to have openly made the comments in an \"interview\" with a tabloid. And in 2016, Trump's hostility at Ivana was escalated in the retelling to suggest he \"leaked\" the claim to the media, and split with her in part because of her breast implants.", "Seemingly missing from all iterations of this rumor about Ivana Trump's breast implants (and her ex-husband's opinion of them) are the basic who, what, when, where, and why aspects. The 1990 Vanity Fair did not allude to any source for the claim Trump had criticized \"those plastic breasts,\" merely including the line among several others describing the alleged mistreatment Mrs. Trump endured. Had the comments been contemporaneously published by any news outlets, that information likely would have been included in the Vanity Fair piece to bolster the impact and credibility of the sourceless anecdote.", "The claim has since skittered about like tumbleweeds, eventually attracting the details that Trump referenced Ivana's \"plastic breasts\" in an interview, then that he leaked the criticism to the media (for unknown reasons), then that he divorced Ivana over breast implants of which he did not approve.", "Although the rumor has circulated in various forms since 1990, we have been unable to locate any published interview in which Trump made any such comments, nor any tabloid material from around 1990 featuring criticism (by anyone) of Ivana Trump's implants.", "It's certainly possible that some version of the rumor may be true, but we haven't unearthed any proof that Donald Trump ever directly, indirectly, or privately made the comments attributed to him about Ivana Trump's breast implants, nor that he divorced her because of aesthetic differences about their suitability.", "Brenner, Marie. \u00a0 \"After the Gold Rush.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Vanity Fair. \u00a0 September 1990.", "Charen, Mona. \u00a0 \"Donald Trump Doesn\u2019t Have the Character to Be President.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 National Review. \u00a0 21 March 2016.", "Friedersdorf, Conor. \u00a0 \"Donald Trump's Cruel Streak.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The Atlantic. \u00a0 26 September 2016.", "Kaye, Elizabeth. \u00a0 \"The Stacks: Ivana Trump's Post-Divorce Glamour.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The Daily Beast. \u00a0 12 March 2016.", "Will, George F. \u00a0 \"Donald Trump Is the GOP\u2019s Chemotherapy.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The Washington Post. \u00a0 10 October 2016.", "The Economist. \u00a0 \"Lessons of the Debate.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 1 October 2016.", "Kim LaCapria is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
