["Foreign leaders are \"troubled\" by some of the rhetoric coming out of the Republican presidential primary, and it\u2019s not just what they\u2019re hearing from Donald Trump, says President Barack Obama.", "\"But this is not just Mr. Trump. Look at the statements that are being made by the other candidates,\" Obama said at a Feb. 16 news conference. \"There is not a single candidate in the Republican primary that thinks we should do anything about climate change, that thinks it\u2019s serious. Well, that's a problem. The rest of the world looks at that and says, how can that be?\"", "Obama\u2019s statement sounded similar to a take from Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders, who recently said, \"Not one Republican has the guts to recognize that climate change is real.\" We rated that claim False because a couple GOP presidential candidates (including some who are no longer in the running) have acknowledged its existence.", "Obama\u2019s claim is different: He said none of the Republicans thinks the country should do anything about climate change.", "To different degrees, the remaining candidates don\u2019t believe man-made climate change is happening, or at least not to the extent that Obama and a vast majority of climate scientists believe it\u2019s happening.", "All of the Republican candidates \u2014 Donald Trump, Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, John Kasich and Ben Carson \u2014 call for scaling back environmental and energy regulations. Some support going through the private sector for renewable energy source development, alongside continued development of fossil fuels, and environmental protection.", "But none have a fleshed-out plan to specifically address the issue of climate change.", "Here\u2019s where the remaining Republican presidential candidates stand on climate change and what they propose to do (or not do) about it.", "Donald Trump", "Trump has said repeatedly that he does not believe in climate change, even suggesting it\u2019s a conspiracy invented by China to make the United States less competitive.", "His website doesn\u2019t have any information on his plans to combat climate change or how he would approach energy issues. He has said he would abolish the Environmental Protection Agency, and the environment will be \"fine.\"", "When MSNBC\u2019s Joe Scarborough asked Trump in November what he would do about climate change, Trump did not outline a specific plan, but he said, \"We want to have clean air to breathe and we want to have beautiful clean water. That's very important to me.\"", "Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla.", "Rubio believes the climate is changing, but he questions how much of it is man-made.", "\"The climate has always changed,\" Rubio said in January. \"There\u2019s never been a time when the climate has not been changing.\"", "He has criticized international climate efforts, as well as Obama\u2019s regulatory measures, saying they are more damaging to the economy than they are helpful to the environment.", "\"If you\u2019re overly dependent on any one source of fuel, then you become vulnerable to disruption,\" he said at the same event in January. \"I want America to truly have a truly all-of-the-above strategy.\"", "Rubio has not released a plan to quell the effects of climate change.", "Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas", "Cruz believes man-made climate change is not real. He has called it a \"pseudoscientific theory\" and has criticized Obama for calling it a major security threat.", "His website says he would abolish the Energy Department and eliminate at least 10 existing climate change and environmental programs.", "Like Rubio, he calls for an \"all-of-the-above\" approach to energy, meaning he supports development of fossil fuels as well as renewable resources, which he says amounts to an \"energy renaissance.\"", "\"We must harness our nation\u2019s energy resources and remove federal impediments to energy exploration, development and trade,\" he wrote.", "Ben Carson", "Carson does not believe in man-made climate change. He has said it\u2019s part of a natural cycle and cannot be \"an excuse not to develop our own God-given natural resources.\"", "His energy plan calls for reducing government regulations on energy production, including fossil fuels that contribute to climate change, but also developing renewable fuels. He also calls on people to be stewards of the environment, but not at the expense of jobs and the economy.", "He did tell Time in October 2015 that if there is \"clear-cut evidence\" that a certain manufacturing practice is causing significant harm to the environment, President Carson might take some action.", "\"I would use the EPA to work with business industry and academia to find the cleanest, most environmentally friendly way to do things, rather than just all right, we\u2019re coming in here and we\u2019re shutting you down,\" he said.", "Ohio Gov. John Kasich", "As recently as Feb. 29, Kasich has said he believes there is a climate change problem, acknowledging he is going against the grain of his party.", "But he has not proposed a full-fledged strategy to address it, and his fact sheet on energy does not mention climate change. He has, though called for pursuing renewable energy sources as one possible response.", "In August, he questioned the extent of man\u2019s impact on the environment, calling full-blown climate change \"some theory that is not proven.\" He said he wouldn\u2019t want to destroy any jobs in order to address these concerns.", "Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush", "Bush has dropped out of the race, but we\u2019re including him because he was still in the running when Obama made his statement.", "He believes climate change is real and human activity is a contributing factor. He had an energy plan but not a specific environmental protection plan.", "He has argued that some of the Obama administration\u2019s regulations go too far, such as Obama\u2019s Clean Power Plan. Like most of the other Republican candidates, he called for reducing regulations and increasing growth in the energy sector, both fossil fuel and renewable sources.", "\"Energy resources must be developed in a way that protects human health and the environment,\" his energy plan said. \"Rules play an important role in making sure this is the case. But the Obama administration\u2019s excessive rules too often usurp state and tribal authority and go beyond what is necessary.\"", "Our ruling", "Obama said, \"There is not a single candidate in the Republican primary that thinks we should do anything about climate change.\"", "None of the remaining Republican presidential candidates have laid out a specific plan to address climate change. All of them call for scaling back Obama\u2019s environmental regulations, to boot.", "Some have called for private-sector development of renewable energy sources. Bush, who was in the race when Obama made his comment, and Kasich both have said they believe human-caused climate change is real and have said pursuing these alternative energy sources could mitigate the problem. But neither has outlined a specific plan.", "For some Republican voters, this stance might be a plus. But it doesn\u2019t change the veracity of Obama\u2019s statement.", "We rate it Mostly True.", "NPR, \"Where Presidential Candidates Stand On Climate Change,\" Aug. 11, 2015", "Des Moines Register, \"Marco Rubio opposes climate change measures,\" Jan. 24, 2016", "Trump campaign, \"Positions,\" accessed Feb. 18, 2016", "Rubio campaign, \"Powering the New American Century,\" accessed Feb. 18, 2016", "Bush campaign, energy plan, accessed Feb. 18, 2016", "Kasich campaign, Kasich action plan, accessed Feb. 18, 2016", "Carson campaign, \"Prescription for an American energy renaissance,\" accessed Feb. 20, 2016", "Carson campaign, \"Environment - Climate Change,\" accessed Feb. 18, 2016", "Cruz campaign, \"Jobs and opportunity,\" accessed Feb. 18, 2016", "Cruz campaign, \"Five for freedom,\" accessed Feb. 18, 2016", "PolitiFact, \"What Donald Trump said about the Chinese inventing the 'hoax' of climate change,\" Jan. 24, 2016", "PolitiFact, \"Bernie Sanders offers overheated claim on where all Republicans stand on climate change,\" Feb. 9, 2016", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
