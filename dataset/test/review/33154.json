["About this rating", "In June 2019, the satire website NPC Daily published an article positing that Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had announced\u00a0 straight marriage would be banned for the duration of gay Pride Month:", "The official legislation won\u2019t pass through the Canadian government until after June, but for now, Trudeau has asked the Canadian people to honor the ban and act in good faith to postpone their June weddings for another month. In Halifax on Sunday, during Trudeau\u2019s announcement, the crowd was awash with awe, and many were in tears. In the crowd, a seven-year-old drag queen fell to her knees and her mother caressed her head. She turned to some onlookers and said, \u201cMy child has been waiting for this moment since she was two years old!\u201d", "This is not a genuine news article.

He said at the time: \"For me, it\u2019s just another great Pride celebration. I\u2019ve been coming to this for years and it's sort of frustrating that it has to be a big thing.
