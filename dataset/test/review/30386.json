["By D'Angelo Gore", "Posted on September 25, 2018", "A misleading TV ad from Sen. Ted Cruz claims Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke \u201csaid crossing the border illegally should not be a crime.\u201d\u00a0O\u2019Rourke wasn\u2019t referring to all illegal border crossings. He said asylum-seekers who enter the country between official entry ports should not be prosecuted.", "To support the claim, the Cruz campaign ad cites a Washington Examiner article that imprecisely paraphrased remarks O\u2019Rourke made in an interview with HuffPost last month.", "\u201cThese asylum-seekers \u2014 penniless, at wit\u2019s end, after surviving three weeks on the road, very often with their children \u2014 then attempt to do what I think any human would do, which is to request asylum in between the ports of entry,\u201d O\u2019Rourke was quoted as saying in that interview. \u201cWe should not criminalize that.\u201d", "But the Examiner began its article by saying that \u201ca trio of Democrats running for top offices in Texas,\u201d including O\u2019Rourke, \u201cwant to decriminalize unauthorized border crossings.\u201d It wasn\u2019t until later in its story that the Examiner mentioned O\u2019Rourke was referring to asylum-seekers.", "Unlike previous administrations, the Trump administration is now referring all illegal border crossings for criminal prosecution under a \u201czero tolerance policy\u201d announced by Attorney General Jeff Sessions in April. That includes individuals who illegally enter the U.S. seeking asylum, a form of protection for those who can\u2019t or won\u2019t return to their home country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution.", "Sessions has said people should apply for asylum at a port of entry to avoid being prosecuted for illegal entry, a misdemeanor offense under federal law.", "The ad, called \u201cDeported,\u201d first aired on Sept. 19. It starts by citing the headlines of news reports about three men who all committed violent acts against women after illegally reentering the U.S. after having been deported numerous times. One of the men, Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, shot and killed Kate Steinle in California in 2015.", "\u201cDeported five times. Deported 11 times. Deported 20 times,\u201d the ad\u2019s narrator says about the men. \u201cBut Beto O\u2019Rourke said crossing the border illegally should not be a crime, and said he\u2019s quote \u2018open to abolishing ICE.\u2019\u201d", "O\u2019Rourke\u2019s comments on Immigration and Customs Enforcement are confusing. He said in June that\u00a0he would be open to a \u201cbetter way to enforce our immigration laws,\u201d adding: \u201cAnd if that involves doing away with this agency, giving that responsibility to somebody else, changing how this agency performs, I\u2019m open to doing that.\u201d", "But then when he was directly asked if he would abolish ICE, he said,\u00a0\u201cno.\u201d", "\u201cI don\u2019t know enough about how we would perform those same enforcement functions, if through another part of the Department of Homeland Security,\u201d he said.", "What O\u2019Rourke did not say, as the Cruz campaign ad suggests, is that he\u2019d be in favor of decriminalizing illegal immigration for all individuals.", "The Washington Examiner article cited in the TV ad says that O\u2019Rourke is one of three Democrats running in Texas who \u201cwant to decriminalize unauthorized border crossings.\u201d", "\u201cU.S. Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke, who\u2019s challenging Republican Sen. Ted Cruz for his Senate seat, gubernatorial candidate Lupe Valdez, and congressional candidate Veronica Escobar told HuffPost they are in favor of such a move, which the report says would be simpler to implement than abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement, as some Democrats have demanded,\u201d the Examiner reported.", "But\u00a0HuffPost made clear that O\u2019Rourke didn\u2019t take the exact position as the other politicians. The article\u2019s subheadline said: \u201cTwo top candidates say Congress should decriminalize unauthorized border crossings entirely, while aspiring U.S. Sen. Beto O\u2019Rourke argues asylum-seekers should be exempted from illegal entry prosecution.\u201d", "And here\u2019s how HuffPost later distinguished O\u2019Rourke\u2019s comments:", "HuffPost, Aug. 23: O\u2019Rourke, who has mounted a competitive campaign to oust Republican Sen. Ted Cruz from his seat, offered more cautious remarks, focusing primarily on the tens of thousands of mostly Central American asylum-seekers who have crossed into the U.S. in recent years. The Trump administration has repeatedly turned away migrant families seeking to enter the U.S. at legal ports of entry, O\u2019Rourke noted.", "Even the Examiner article \u2014 toward the end \u2014 went on to say that \u201cO\u2019Rourke said the U.S. \u2018should not criminalize\u2019 immigrants requesting asylum in between ports of entry.\u201d", "The Cruz ad also failed to mention that decriminalizing unauthorized entry would still leave officials the option of deporting violators by bringing civil charges.", "\u201cTreating unauthorized crossing as a civil violation allowed the government to deport unauthorized immigrants without spending huge sums on prosecuting and jailing migrants that U.S. officials planned to deport anyway,\u201d HuffPost said.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
