["About this rating", "Amid controversy over playing the Super Bowl halftime show, the band Maroon 5, along with their label Interscope Records and the NFL,  partnered on a $500,000 donation to the children's charity Big Brothers Big Sisters of America.", "Super Bowl halftime acts don't receive a fee for performing, so Maroon 5 did not donate their \"performance fee.\"", "On 3 February 2019, Super Bowl Sunday, the viral news and entertainment site LADbible.com reported that the pop music band and Super Bowl LIII halftime act Maroon 5 had donated their \"entire $500,000 Super Bowl fee\" to a children's charity:", "Although it's true that Maroon 5 partnered with their label Interscope Records and the National Football League (NFL) in making a $500,000 donation to the children's charity Big Brothers Big Sisters of America, the money didn't come out of the band's performance fee. NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy clarified in an email that Super Bowl halftime acts don't receive performance fees.", "McCarthy referred us to a statement from Maroon 5 lead singer Adam Levine provided to People magazine that said: \"Playing the Super Bowl has been a dream of our band for a long time. We thank the NFL for the opportunity and also to them, along with Interscope Records, for making this donation to Big Brothers Big Sisters, which will have a major impact for children across the country.\"", "Maroon 5 followed the lead of rapper Travis Scott, who only agreed to perform at the Super Bowl after the NFL vowed to make a $500,000 donation to Dream Corps, a social justice-oriented non-profit founded by Van Jones in 2015.", "The large donations to charitable organizations were the result of the mounting pressure the NFL was facing over what critics called the \"blacklisting\" by the league of former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick.", "In 2016, Kaepernick began kneeling during the playing of the national anthem before NFL games in protest over police violence against black Americans. As his protest spread and was adopted by other players in the league, so did the backlash. In reference to players' kneeling before games, President Donald Trump in September 2017 stated: \u201cWouldn\u2019t you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, \u2018Get that son of a bitch off the field right now. Out! He\u2019s fired. He\u2019s fired!\u2019\u201d", "Kaepernick hasn't played since opting out of his contract with the San Francisco 49ers in 2017 and has filed a grievance against the NFL, accusing team owners of colluding in not signing him.", "As a result of the controversy, the NFL had trouble securing halftime acts for Super Bowl LIII, with A-list entertainers such as Rihanna, Cardi B, Jay-Z, and Pink declining to perform in solidarity with Kaepernick. In an interview with the Associated Press, rapper Cardi B said, \u201cI got to sacrifice a lot of money to perform. But there\u2019s a man who sacrificed his job for us, so we got to stand behind him.\u201d", "Maroon 5's act of charity didn't save them from harsh criticism for crossing \"the ideological or intellectual picket line,\" as Kaepernick's attorney Mark Geragos put it in an interview with ABC News. \"In fact, if anything, it\u2019s a cop-out when you start talking about, 'I\u2019m not a politician I\u2019m just doing the music.' Most of the musicians who have any kind of consciousness whatsoever understand what's going on here.\"", "Tracy, Brianne. \u00a0 \"Maroon 5 and the NFL Announce $500,000 Charity Donation Ahead of Super Bowl Halftime Show.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 People. \u00a0 31 January 2019.", "Ruggieri, Melissa. \u00a0 \"Super Bowl 53: Travis Scott\u2019s Halftime Inclusion Comes Wwth Charitable Contribution from NFL.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Atlanta Journal-Constitution. \u00a0 14 January 2019.", "Landrum, Jonathan Jr. \u00a0 \"Cardi B Declined Super Bowl Halftime with \u2018Mixed Feelings.'\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Associated Press. \u00a0 1 February 2019.", "Allen, Karma et al. \u00a0 \"Maroon 5's Adam Levine Addresses 'Controversy' Surrounding Super Bowl Halftime Show, Teases Performance.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 ABC News. \u00a0 1 February 2019.", "Langone, Alix. \u00a0 \"Here's How Much Maroon 5 Is Getting Paid to Perform at the 2019 Super Bowl.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Yahoo Finance. \u00a0 3 February 2019.", "Bieler, Des. \u00a0\" Colin Kaepernick Thanks Rihanna for Her Super Bowl Boycott.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The Washington Post. \u00a0 5 February 2019.", "Bethania Palma is a journalist from the Los Angeles area who has been working in the news industry since 2006.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
