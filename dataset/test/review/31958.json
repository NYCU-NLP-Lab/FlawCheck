["About this rating", "Amid talk of \u201calternative facts\u201d and a \u201cpost-truth\u201d world that dominated the news directly after the inauguration of President Donald Trump on 20 January 2017, a quote from astrophysicist and science communicator Carl Sagan emerged as a viral meme:", "This is the excerpt from the passage containing that quote which was shared most frequently:", "Science is more than a body of knowledge; it is a way of thinking. I have a foreboding of an America in my children\u2019s or grandchildren\u2019s time \u2014 when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the key manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what\u2019s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness.", "This excerpt was taken from Sagan\u2019s 1995 book The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark. In a May 1997 review of that work, Smithsonian magazine described Sagan's motivation for writing it: \"In The Demon-Haunted World, the late astronomer Carl Sagan writes in defense of science and reason in a world he sees as darkened by ignorance, superstition, pseudoscience, deceitful advertising and mindless television.\"", "Sagan, for his part, described the book as \"a personal statement, reflecting my lifelong love affair with science.\"", "The discussion of a loss of manufacturing jobs, an inability for public officials to grasp issues, and increasing distrust in science led many to assert that Sagan was predicting our current political and scientific climate \u2014 although, as Matt Novak articulated in a piece for Gizmodo, it\u2019s often easy to view predictions of the future in a way that biases one's reading of the them:", "Now, it\u2019s important to remember that the \u201caccuracy\u201d of predictions is often a Rorschach test. An interpretation of a particular prediction\u2019s accuracy usually says a lot about the people interpreting them and their own hopes or fears for the future. And honestly, some of Sagan\u2019s concerns sound rather quaint.", "If you continue reading, the chapter goes on to talk about how the most popular videocassette rental was Dumb and Dumber, and how Beavis and Butthead was incredibly popular on TV. This, of course, was 1995, but there\u2019s not much new to this way of thinking \u2014 each generation thinks that the next generation\u2019s media is toxic and vapid and worthless.", "Relevancy of the movie Dumb and Dumber notwithstanding, themes regarding the erosion of trust in favor of one's own deeply entrenched views appear repeatedly in the book. For example:", "One of the saddest lessons of history is this: If we\u2019ve been bamboozled long enough, we tend to reject any evidence of the bamboozle. We\u2019re no longer interested in finding out the truth. The bamboozle has captured us. It\u2019s simply too painful to acknowledge, even to ourselves, that we\u2019ve been taken. Once you give a charlatan power over you, you almost never get it back.", "Whether or not 2017 was the fulfillment of a Carl Sagan nightmare is a subjective matter, but the proffered description of that nightmare was authentic.", "Sagan, Carl. \u00a0 The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Random House, 1995. \u00a0 ISBN 0-345-40946-9.", "Trachtman, Paul. \u00a0 \u201cReview of 'The Demon-Haunted World', 'Einstein, History, and Other Passions', 'The End of Science.\u2019\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Smithsonian. \u00a0 May 1997.", "Novak, Matt. \u00a0 \u201cYes, The Eerie Carl Sagan Prediction That's Going Viral Is Real.\u201d \u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Paleofuture. \u00a0 23 January 2017.", "Alex Kasprak is an investigative journalist and science writer reporting on scientific misinformation, online fraud, and financial crime.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
