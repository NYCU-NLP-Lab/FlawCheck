Because we have a fleet of more than 100 buses, once every couple of months, there are such instances wherein there is attempted robbery or vandalism. This is not the first time that such a thing has happened. However, the bus was sent to pick up students in the morning due to exams. Some of the parents clicked photographs of the damaged bus and subsequently, rumours started spreading on social media.\u201d", "He added that parents of the school children have been intimated regarding the incident, asking them not to panic. \u201cWe sent a message to parents on the official school app saying there is nothing to worry, as parents were concerned. We have also informed the police about the incident.\u201d A screenshot of the message sent by the school management to parents is posted below.", "Readers may note that an incident of a school bus being attacked due to Bharat bandh protests did indeed occur, but the school bus which was attacked over Bharat bandh protest belongs to Caelum school in Pune.", "While it is true that the school bus of Caelum school in Pune was indeed attacked during Bharat bandh, the photographs of the damaged school bus of Sanskriti school are misleading as they had been vandalised the previous day i.e. on September 9 and had nothing to do with the bandh.
