Chris Christie.\n\nBut even Christie, a top Romney surrogate tapped to deliver the keynote address on Aug. 28 at the Republican National Convention, admits the rest of the state isn\u2019t likely to swing in favor of the presumptive Republican presidential nominee.\n\n\"I don't think Mitt Romney's counting our electoral votes in his column. I believe the overwhelming likelihood is that President [Barack] Obama will win New Jersey. I think all the polls indicate that,\" Christie said during an Aug. 7 press conference\n\n\"A Republican hasn't won [an election] for a presidency in New Jersey since 1988. And so it's a been a long haul. Could it happen? Sure, it could happen. But I think if Mitt Romney wins New Jersey he's probably going to win in 45 other states,\" Christie said.\n\nPolitiFact New Jersey can\u2019t check Christie\u2019s electoral prediction, but we can test his claim about the state\u2019s past votes on the Truth-O-Meter. Was 1988 the last time New Jersey went red in a presidential election?\n\nIt\u2019s true: a majority of voters in the Garden State cast votes in 1988 for the then-GOP presidential candidate George H. W. Bush.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t an aberration at the time. Republican nominees had won New Jersey in every presidential election since 1968. \u00a0\n\nBush took New Jersey in 1988 with more than 56 percent of the vote, defeating Democratic rival Michael Dukakis to secure a spot in the White House.\n\nBut four years later, New Jersey voters decided against sending Bush back to Washington for a second term.\n\nBill Clinton edged out Bush in New Jersey in 1992, grabbing nearly 43 percent of the state\u2019s vote. Bush lost the state with more than 40 percent of the vote.\n\nSince then New Jersey has voted for the Democratic presidential candidate in every election cycle. \u00a0\n\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of New Jersey\u2019s presidential voting history:", "Our ruling\n\nChristie said \"a Republican hasn't won [an election] for a presidency in New Jersey since 1988.\"\n\nWhen Bush took on Dukakis in 1988, a majority of New Jersey voters cast a ballot for the Republican candidate, helping send Bush to the White House.\n\nBut four years later, the tide turned in New Jersey and the state has voted Democratic in every presidential election since.\n\nWe rate this claim True.", "To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.", "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/cc018ecd-6033-4be2-8a2c-fff8a1cb58ce", "The Asbury Park Press, Christie in demand to raise cash for the GOP, Aug. 12, 2012\n\nU.S. House of Representatives: Office of the Clerk, Election Statistics, accessed Aug. 14, 2012\n\nNew Jersey Division of Elections, NJ Election Information and Results Archive, accessed Aug. 14, 2012\n\nNew Jersey Division of Elections, November 2008 General Election results, accessed Aug. 14, 2012\n\nNew Jersey Division of Elections, November 2004 General Election results\n\nNew Jersey Division of Elections, November 2000 General Election results\n\nNew Jersey Division of Elections, November 1996 General Election results\n\nNew Jersey Division of Elections, November 1992 General Election results\n\nNew Jersey Division of Elections, November 1988 General Election results\n\nNew Jersey Division of Elections, November 1984 General Election results\n\nNew Jersey Division of Election, General Election Data: 1924 to 2010", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
