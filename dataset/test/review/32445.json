["\u201cPelosi said if President Trump wins she will resign,\u201d claims a short message published by dozens of Facebook users in August 2020.", "Identical posts featuring the same claim and a portion of The Lord\u2019s Prayer, jokingly hinting at approval, were also posted on Instagram and Twitter, and shared tens of thousands of times.", "However, the San Francisco representative never mentioned plans to resign in case of a Trump victory.", "Drew Hammill, deputy chief of staff for Pelosi, told AFP in an email that the claim was \u201cfalse.\u201d", "The posts seem to be inspired by an April 12, 2020 article published on satirical news website bustatroll.org. Written by \u201cHarry Helmet\u201d, it is headlined \u201cPelosi Promises to Resign if Trump is Re-Elected.\u201d", "\u201cI am here today to make an important announcement. If Donald Trump wins in November, I will immediately resign my position as Speaker of the House and as Congresswoman,\u201d the article claimed she said in a speech.", "But a disclaimer on the website\u2019s \u201cAbout Us\u201d section warns: \u201cEverything on this website is fiction.\u201d.", "The disclaimer adds that bustatroll.org \u201cis a subsidiary of the \u2018America\u2019s Last line of Defense\u2019 network of parody, satire, and tomfoolery.\u201d The ambiguous nature of this network\u2019s tone has led much of its content to be taken seriously by online users.", "A search for the word \u201cresign\u201d on the Speaker\u2019s Twitter and Facebook accounts, as well as through her official press releases, statements, and press conference transcripts shows many results, but none concerning herself. All of those official statements called for the resignation of Trump administration officials like former EPA chief Scott Pruitt, former Secretary of Labor Alexander Acosta, or former Attorney General Jeff Sessions.", "On August 23, 2020, Pelosi told CNN that she would accept Trump\u2019s re-election, \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean that we will not shout out against his initiatives,\u201d she said. Pelosi made no mention of resignation then.", "In March 2020, Pelosi evoked the possibility of another Trump term during a women\u2019s summit where she stated the country \u201ccannot withstand\u201d it. Again, she did not mention a resignation.", "The House speaker\u2019s strong stances against Donald Trump, particularly by initiating in December the president\u2019s impeachment, have made her a regular target of Trump and his supporters.", "AFP debunked a similar hoax in January 2020, when online users claimed that Pelosi would resign if the impeachment process against the president failed. The claim had also originated on bustatroll.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023. All rights reserved.
