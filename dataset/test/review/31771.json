["About this rating", "On 3 August 2017, the BlueLivesMatter.blue blog published a post largely lifted from a New York Post article, both reporting that two New York City Police Department officers had been refused service at a Dunkin' Donuts in Brooklyn:", "A pair of NYPD officers were denied service at a Brooklyn Dunkin\u2019 Donuts by a clerk who said, \u201cI don\u2019t serve cops\u201d \u2014 and the head of the detectives union is leading a boycott of the chain, The Post has learned.", "Detectives\u2019 Endowment Association President Michael Palladino said Thursday that the blatant discrimination was \u201cdisgraceful and it should not go unattended ... I assume it is an isolated incident. Nevertheless, Dunkin\u2019 Donuts corporate should issue an apology to the NYPD and until that happens, I have asked detectives and their families to refrain from patronizing the stores,\u201d he said.", "Palladino also took a thinly veiled swipe at Mayor Bill de Blasio and other city officials in apportioning blame for the Sunday afternoon incident at 1993 Atlantic Ave.", "\u201cPolitical leaders in this city have encouraged this type of behavior by constantly demonizing cops and pushing their decriminalization agenda,\u201d he said.", "Details offered near the end of the original article which were missed by many casual readers \u2014 and omitted from the BlueLivesMatter.blue post entirely \u2014 included a quote from the manager at the store, who said that the plainclothes officers were standing in the pickup area of the store and did not place an order:", "These two men in shirts and ties \u2014 who I later found out were police \u2014 must have never come to this Dunkin\u2019 Donuts before, because instead of waiting in the line where you order, they waited at the counter where you pick up your order ... You can see on the security tape: they stand here for five minutes, while other customers were being served. One customer even ordered ice cream, and they must\u2019ve not like that because they left the store[.]", "The manager, who wouldn\u2019t give his name, wouldn\u2019t let The Post view the video.", "... I kept trying to explain [to angry callers that] we serve everyone, we have nothing but respect for the police, and that they were standing at the wrong counter. It was busy at the time, and we were busy serving customers.", "In a second New York Post piece hours later, the paper repeated the report, then added that a representative for the chain had apologized to one of the involved officers. No one appears to have confirmed which version of events was accurate one, although the Post implies that the claim was verified by questioning whether the worker involved had been \"disciplined\":", "The owner of a Brooklyn Dunkin\u2019 Donuts where two NYPD cops were refused service has personally apologized to one of the officers and plans a meeting to try and put the matter to rest, the shop\u2019s corporate parent said Thursday.", "In a prepared statement, Dunkin\u2019 Brands spokeswoman Michelle King said the company was \u201caware of the recent situation\u201d \u2014 in which a worker declared, \u201cI don\u2019t serve cops\u201d \u2014 revealed exclusively by The Post.", "\u201cThe franchisee who owns and operates this restaurant informed us that immediately upon learning of this situation earlier this week, he contacted one of the police officers involved to personally apologize for any negative experience he may have had in his store,\u201d she said.", "\u201cThe franchisee of the Brooklyn restaurant is meeting with the police officer he spoke to earlier this week in person to hopefully bring this to a satisfactory conclusion for all involved.\u201d", "The provided statement gave no indication that Dunkin' Donuts had apologized for anything other than the officers' interpretation of events, and the absence of mention of employee discipline seemed to suggest that the company did not observe any such behavior on the tape. Both versions closely follow the ever-popular \"shunned serviceman\" and \"shunned policeman\" template of urban legends and rumors, which date back decades but have spiked in popularity with the advent of social media. Nearly all viral \"shunned policeman\" tales turns out to be misinterpretations or exaggerations that nevertheless can cause lasting harm to businesses targeted by the sticky slurs.", "We contacted the media relations department of Dunkin' Donuts to request further information and on 9 August 2017 a representative for the chain responded:", "Dunkin' Donuts sincerely apologizes to the two police officers who were left unattended in the store. We have a long history of supporting the NYPD and we look forward to continuing that support in the future.", "Cohen, Shawn et al. \u00a0 \u201cDunkin\u2019 Donuts Worker Is Accused of Refusing to Serve NYPD Cops.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 New York Post. \u00a0 3 August 2017.", "Golding, Bruce. \u00a0 \u201cBrooklyn Dunkin\u2019 Donuts Owner Apologizes for Not Serving NYPD.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 New York Post. \u00a0 3 August 2017.", "Kim LaCapria is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
