Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., is pressing Joe Biden hard on his past stands on Social Security.", "Sanders\u2019 current ad in heavy rotation in Florida has a picture of Biden under the words \"Biden has advocated cutting Social Security for 40 years.\"", "The ad plays audio of Biden from 1995 saying, \"When I argued that we should freeze federal spending, I meant Social Security as well. I meant Medicare and Medicaid. I meant veterans benefits. I meant every single solitary thing in the government.

Our focus here is on the specific claim that he has pushed for cuts for 40 years.", "A plain reading of that would be that Biden consistently sought to reduce benefit payments for most of his career. The reality is that Biden\u2019s position has changed over time.", "In roughly 10-year hops, starting in the 1970s, he went from calling for a 7% increase, then for a one-year freeze, then floated raising the retirement age, then backed a change in how benefits would increase, and has ended up today calling for higher benefits.", "In 1973, as a first-term senator, Biden co-sponsored a bill to increase monthly benefits by 7%.", "During the 1980s and 1990s, Biden spoke in favor of freezes to Social Security as part of an effort to rein in all spending to reduce the deficit.", "\"The only way that Congress will ever be able to come to grips with deficits is by dealing with all federal programs as a package,\" Biden said in 1984.", "In 1984, Biden co-sponsored a proposal with two GOP senators to broadly freeze federal spending.

The record is much more nuanced than that. Over his decades in the Senate, Biden generally pushed to protect Social Security, but he also supported ideas that would reduce Social Security benefits over time.", "The audio in the Sanders ad of Biden calling for a total freeze on government spending dates back 25 years. About 13 years ago, Biden said he was open to benefit reductions, and then a few months later, said increasing taxes was better than reducing benefits.", "During the Obama administration, he was on board with a proposal that would have reduced benefits about four percentage points over four decades.
