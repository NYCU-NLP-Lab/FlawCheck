["By Jessica McDonald", "Posted on March 29, 2019 | Updated on April 1, 2019", "Falsely declaring that he has \u201calways\u201d been a supporter of the Great Lakes, President Donald Trump announced that he would fully fund the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative with $300 million, telling a Michigan crowd he would finally get done something they \u201chave been trying to get for over 30 years.\u201d", "In fact, the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative has been around since 2010, and it has been fully funded in recent years despite \u2014 not because of \u2014 Trump\u2019s efforts.", "At a rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan on Mar. 28, Trump began by announcing that he had \u201csome breaking news.\u201d", "Trump, March 28: I support the Great Lakes. Always have. They\u2019re beautiful. They\u2019re big. Very deep. Record deepness, right? And I\u2019m going to get, in honor of my friends, full funding of $300 million for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, which you\u2019ve been trying to get for over 30 years. So we\u2019ll get it done. It\u2019s time. It\u2019s time. You\u2019ve been trying to get it over 30 years. I would say it\u2019s time, right?", "Trump\u2019s announcement was an about-face from the proposed 2020 budget he released just over two weeks ago, and which called for slashing the Great Lakes restoration budget by 90 percent. It was the third year in a row the president\u2019s budget has proposed gutting federal funding for the program. To date, Congress has ignored those proposed cuts.", "Trump is also wrong about his geography. While the Great Lakes are indeed big, they\u2019re not exceptionally deep.", "The Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, or GLRI, began in 2010 under President Obama with the aim of cleaning up the most polluted areas of the Great Lakes. Since then, more than 4,000 projects have focused on improving water quality, restoring habitats and combating invasive species.", "In its first fiscal year, Obama recommended \u2014 \u00a0and the initiative received \u2014 $475 million. After that high point, funding dropped in fiscal year 2011 to just under $300 million. And funding has stayed steady around that level ever since.", "In his last two budget proposals, including the fiscal year 2020 budget released this month, Trump proposed just $30 million \u2014 the equivalent of a 90 percent cut. In his first proposed budget for fiscal year 2018, the president allotted zero funding for the program.", "In a document explaining the justification for the funding shift, the Environmental Protection Agency wrote in both 2018 and 2019, \u201cThis program change reduces support for the Great Lakes Program. This returns responsibility for local government efforts to state and local entities.\u201d", "It\u2019s important to note that a president\u2019s budget proposal is more a symbolic statement of priorities than something Congress would vote on. In the past, Congress has chosen to ignore the White House calls to slash the GLRI budget. The last two congressionally approved budgets \u2014 which Trump signed \u2014 retained funding of about $300 million a year.", "Explaining Trump\u2019s position change on Great Lakes funding, a senior administration official told us via email, \u201cThe President trusts his agencies and staff to implement his goals and vision, but when specific issues, like the Great Lakes restoration, are presented to him he has every right to take a different approach. His announcement last night to increase his funding request for this worthy project does not change the overall goals of the budget and we will work with Congress to ensure the President\u2019s priorities and agenda are advanced on behalf of the American people.\u201d", "We also reached out to the EPA for comment, and John Konkus, a deputy associate administrator for public affairs at EPA, replied via email, \u201cAs the President stated, the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative is unique both as an inter-agency initiative and because it is an international watershed. It was because of constraints in our budget that it was not fully funded at the authorized amount, but we certainly agree with and support the direction of the President as it relates to this very important program.\u201d", "Finally, Trump exaggerated the depth of the Great Lakes. The Great Lakes can claim a handful of superlatives, but depth isn\u2019t one of them.", "The deepest of the five lakes, according to figures assembled by the EPA, is Lake Superior, which boasts a maximum depth of 1,332 feet. That\u2019s well short of Oregon\u2019s Crater Lake, which at 1,949 feet is the domestic record holder. And globally, Lake Baikal, located in Russia just north of Mongolia, is the world\u2019s deepest lake. It stretches down some 5,300-plus feet, or more than a mile.", "Update, April 1: A reader suggested that Trump might have been referring to the current\u00a0water levels\u00a0of the Great Lakes, which have been high recently. We asked the White House to explain what the president meant by \u201crecord deepness,\u201d but did not receive a reply.", "But even if Trump was referring to the water levels, he\u2019s still wrong about the depth. According to data posted on the U.S. Army Corps of Engineer\u2019s Detroit District website,\u00a0none of the lakes\u00a0are at record high water levels.", "Lake Superior is the closest to breaking a record, but its\u00a0average daily mean water level\u00a0in March was still 1.8 inches below the 1986 record.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
