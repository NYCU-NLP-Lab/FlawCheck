["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "Winning his bid for Congress has put Wadsworth Republican Jim Renacci in the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee\u2019s crosshairs for the foreseeable future.\n\nOn Dec. 7, the campaign arm of House of Representatives Democrats sent a \"Republican Hypocrisy Alert\" to reporters titled \"Representative-elect Jim Renacci Tells Washington Special Interests He is \u2018Open for Business.\u2019\"\n\nThe news release cited news reports that listed Renacci among a group of newly elected Republican legislators who held post-election fundraisers in Washington, D.C., to pay off the debt from their campaigns.\n\n\"Representative-elect Jim Renacci claimed to run against the Washington establishment, but less than a month after being elected Renacci is hypocritically embracing it with big money, special interest fundraisers,\" DCCC spokesperson Ryan Rudominer said in the release.\n\nOn Dec. 8, Renacci spokesman James Slepian confirmed Renacci held a Dec. 7 lunch fundraiser to help retire his campaign debts. He said it was attended by about a dozen people, including political action committee representatives. Slepian called it \"disingenuous\" for the DCCC to attack Renacci for holding a fundraiser with PACs in light of the fact that the DCCC-backed incumbent that Renacci beat, Rep. John Boccieri, got most of his election money from PACs. During his term in Congress, Boccieri held numerous PAC fundraisers in Washington, according to a Sunlight Foundation database of fundraising invitations.\n\n\"We are just raising some money the way every other elected official is trying to do,\" Slepian said. \"There wasn\u2019t an \u2018open for business\u2019 sign anywhere.\"\n\nIs Renacci being hypocritical for raising PAC money after his election?\n\nDuring his campaign for Congress, Renacci often criticized his Democratic rival for relying on political action committee money. It\u2019s a standard charge that challengers throw at incumbents. An Oct. 15 news release from Renacci said that \"John Boccieri has consistently relied on Washington special interests and union bosses to finance his campaign \u2014 with a majority of his contributions coming from political action committees.\"\n\nA review of Boccieri\u2019s latest Federal Election Commission report shows the incumbent got about $1,047,000 from political action committees and $983,000 from individuals, which means he got roughly 52 percent of his money from PACs. A Center for Responsive Politics analysis of Boccieri\u2019s PAC donations shows about a third of them came from organized labor, a third came from businesses and a third from \"ideological or single issue\" groups.\n\nBut even as Renacci complained about Boccieri\u2019s political action committee money, he took it himself. Federal Election Committee records show that Renacci\u2019s campaign got about $317,000 from political action committees and $1.1 million in donations from individuals. Renacci, an independently wealthy businessman, also loaned about $750,000 of his own money to the campaign. That\u2019s the debt he\u2019s now trying to pay off. About 15 percent of Renacci\u2019s money came from PACs, about half was from individual donors, and about a third came from his own pocket.\n\nRenacci accepted money from political action committees long before he won his election. Those that gave him $10,000 before November include committees representing Timken Co., Murray Energy and the American Health Care Association. The bulk of his PAC money came from committees operated by GOP politicians and from businesses, according to a Center for Responsive Politics breakdown of Renacci\u2019s donations.\n\nDuring the campaign, Renacci was up front about his political action committee backing, putting out news releases when well known conservative PACS like the Family Research Council Action PAC, the Ohio Right to Life PAC, the House Conservatives Fund, and The Citizens United Political Victory Fund, announced they\u2019d back him.\n\nDictionaries define a hypocrite as someone whose actions contradict their stated beliefs. While Renacci publicly denounced Boccieri for accepting a large proportion of PAC money, he accepted PAC money himself all along, and continues to do so. He also publicly touted some of the ideological group PACs that backed his campaign.\n\nSo while there is an element of hypocrisy given Renacci\u2019s past criticism, the DCCC\u2019s indignation needs to be put in context, especially since its candidate received a majority of his contributions from PACs.\n\nIf Renacci\u2019s PAC fundraising begins to outstrip his individual fundraising, he could end up deeper in hypocrisy territory. Meantime, we say the DCCC\u2019s charge is Half True.", "The Washington Post, \"House rookies meet \u2018new day\u2019 the old way,\" Dec. 6, 2010\n\nDemocratic Congressional Campaign Committee press release, Dec. 7, 2010\n\nInterview with Renacci spokesman James Slepian, Dec. 8, 2010\n\nRenacci campaign news releases dated Oct. 15, April 29, April 6, March 10, and Feb.25, all from 2010\n\nFederal Election Commission Reports\n\nPAC breakdowns from the Center for Responsive Politics", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
