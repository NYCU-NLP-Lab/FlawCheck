["By Vanessa Schipani", "Posted on June 2, 2016", "In promoting his energy plan, Donald Trump made two\u00a0false claims:", "On May 26, Trump held a press conference\u00a0and then\u00a0gave a speech\u00a0in Bismarck, North Dakota, where he unveiled what he called an \u201cAmerica First\u201d energy plan.\u00a0In his press conference, Trump said he is \u201cinto all types of energy,\u201d but he singled out wind energy as \u201ca problem\u201d because it kills eagles. In his speech, he also spoke generally about birds that are killed by wind farms.", "Trump, May 26: The Department of Justice filed a lawsuit against seven North Dakota oil companies for the deaths of 28 birds while the administration fast-tracked wind projects that kill more than 1 million birds a year.", "According to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, \u201ccollisions with wind turbines and associated infrastructure (e.g., transmission lines and towers)\u201d pose a threat to wildlife \u2014 migratory birds and eagles in particular. But Trump exaggerates the number of bird deaths due to wind farms, and fails to mention that\u00a0fossil-fuel plants kill far more birds per year than wind farms.", "As for the North Dakota lawsuit, Trump is correct that seven oil companies were charged for violating the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. The lawsuit stems from the deaths of 28 birds found in oil waste pits from May 6, 2011, to June 20, 2011. According to the Associated Press,\u00a0Slawson Exploration Company Inc. \u201caccounted for the bulk of the 28 dead birds discovered by federal wildlife officials.\u201d Under a plea agreement, Slawson paid \u201c$12,000 \u2014 or $1,000 per bird \u2014 to the nonprofit National Fish and Wildlife Foundation,\u201d reported AP.", "Scientific studies have come up with a wide range of mean estimates concerning bird mortality due to wind farms\u00a0\u2013 from 20,000 to 573,000 bird deaths per year. But no study has estimated that wind farms\u00a0presently kill 1 million birds a year, as Trump claimed.", "To start, the\u00a0Fish and Wildlife Service\u00a0\u201cestimates that wind turbines may kill a half a million birds a year.\u201d", "K. Shawn Smallwood, an ornithologist who studies the impacts of wind farms on birds, also\u00a0published a study in the journal Wildlife Society Bulletin in 2013 that estimated 573,000 bird fatalities per year, which included 83,000 raptor fatalities. This was when the\u00a0country\u2019s capacity\u00a0for wind energy production was at 51,630 megawatts (MW), he writes in his paper.", "However, Smallwood told us by email that these estimates may be old. Since \u201cthe last estimates were published, wind energy capacity has increased considerably,\u201d he said.\u00a0At the end of 2015, the total U.S. installed wind capacity was 73,992 MW, according to the American Wind Energy Association.", "In a 2013 paper published in Biological Conservation, Scott Loss and colleagues also write, \u201cThe total amount of bird collision mortality at U.S. wind facilities will likely increase with increased wind energy development in the coming decades.\u201d\u00a0That paper estimates that the number of bird casualties from wind farms could rise to around 1.4 million per year if the\u00a0Department of Energy meets its goal\u00a0to have 20 percent of total U.S. electricity generated from wind power by 2030. But only\u00a04.7 percent of U.S. electricity generation came from wind in 2015.", "Smallwood told us that \u201cso as far as I\u2019m aware no such estimate [of 1 million bird deaths] exists\u201d today.", "In his claim, Trump also misleadingly compared bird deaths at oil drilling operations with\u00a0those at wind farms.\u00a0A\u00a02012 Bureau of Land Management memo states that \u201coil field production skim pits and centralized oilfield wastewater disposal facilities kill an estimated 500,000 to 1,000,000 birds annually.\u201d This suggests oil production alone (i.e. not including the production of coal or gas) can kill the same, if not more, birds per year than wind farms in the U.S.", "Even still, there are greater threats to birds than energy production, including cats and buildings.", "A 2013 Nature study by Loss and others estimated that \u201cfree-ranging domestic cats kill 1.3\u20134.0 billion birds\u201d in the U.S. annually. But the researchers added, \u201cUn-owned cats, as opposed to owned pets, cause the majority of this mortality.\u201d", "In another study published in the journal\u00a0The Condor in 2014, Loss and colleagues also estimated \u201cthat between 365 [million] and 988 million birds \u2026 are killed annually by building collisions in the U.S., with roughly 56% of mortality at low-rises, 44% at residences, and <1% at high-rises.\u201d", "In short, Trump was misleading\u00a0at best and wrong\u00a0at worst\u00a0when he said, \u201cThe Department of Justice filed a lawsuit against seven North Dakota oil companies for the deaths of 28 birds while the Administration fast-tracked wind projects that kill more than 1 million birds a year.\u201d No studies estimate 1 million bird deaths per year due to wind farms today, and research suggests oil production\u00a0kills the same, if not more, birds per year than wind farms. Nevertheless, cats remain\u00a0birds\u2019 greatest threat.", "At the\u00a0press conference held before his energy speech, Trump also claimed \u201cif you go to various places in California, wind is killing all of the eagles. You know, if you shoot an eagle \u2026 they want to put you in jail for five years. And yet the windmills are killing hundreds and hundreds of eagles \u2026 they\u2019re killing them by the hundreds and nothing happens.\u201d", "Trump\u2019s claim about the penalty for shooting a bald eagle is false.", "According to the Fish and Wildlife Service, the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act prohibits \u201cthe take, possession, sale, purchase, barter, offer to sell, purchase or barter, transport, export or import, of any bald or golden eagle, alive or dead, including any part, nest, or egg, unless allowed by permit.\u201d A \u201ctake\u201d includes the act shooting, poisoning, wounding and killing an eagle.", "FWS states that \u201ccivil penalties for violating provisions of the Act\u201d are \u201ca maximum fine of $5,000 or one year imprisonment with $10,000 or not more than two years in prison for a second conviction.\u201d That means first-time violators are likely to serve little or no time in jail.", "For example, in 2009 the State Journal-Register reported that Jerry Kronable, a resident of Illinois, violated \u201cthe Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act and was ordered to pay a $5,000 fine, serve one year of probation and forfeit the rifle he used to shoot the eagle.\u201d", "Also in 2009, Jesse Barresse, a resident of Florida, was sentenced\u00a0to\u00a0six months in federal prison, a year of supervised release and a $500 fine for intentionally shooting and killing a bald eagle.", "Likewise, in Alaska in 2000, Richard Hart pleaded guilty to shooting and killing a bald eagle. He was sentenced with two years of probation, a $1,500 fine, 150 hours of community service and alcohol abuse counseling. He also had to give up his hunting privileges for one year and forfeit the rifle he used to shoot the eagle.", "But what about his claim that wind turbines \u201care killing hundreds and hundreds of eagles\u201d?\u00a0We reached out to Trump\u2019s office to ask if he was referring to eagles killed by wind farms nationwide or just in California, but we have yet to hear back.", "If Trump means the number of eagles killed by wind turbines per year in California, we refer you to an item\u00a0by our friends at PolitiFact. They reported that the \u201cbest estimate is that about 100 golden eagles die each year from collisions with wind turbine blades [in California]. The data are not perfect, but the people most concerned about the welfare of the eagles do not go along with Trump\u2019s figure.\u201d", "Researchers have even less reliable estimates of the number of eagles killed by wind farms nationwide. Joel E. Pagel, a raptor ecologist at the Fish and Wildlife Service, and others counted \u201ca minimum of 85 eagle mortalities at 32 wind energy facilities in 10 states during 1997 through 30 June 2012.\u201d\u00a0But the group also writes in its\u00a02013 Journal of Raptor Research paper that the\u00a0findings \u201clikely underestimate, perhaps substantially, the number of eagles killed at wind facilities in the United States.\u201d", "This underestimation is due to the fact that \u201cassessments of eagle mortality at commercial-scale and/or private wind energy facilities are either seldom conducted or in some cases not made available for public review,\u201d the authors argue.", "Pagel and colleagues\u2019 study didn\u2019t include eagle deaths at the Altamount Pass Wind Resource Area in California, for which there are better data. At the APWRA, Smallwood estimated 67 golden eagle deaths per year in a study published in the Journal of Wildlife Management in 2010.", "But he also told Politifact that the estimate should be much lower today because old turbines were \u201creplaced by larger turbines that are being more carefully sited to reduce eagle fatalities.\u201d", "According to the FWS, \u201cEagles appear to be particularly susceptible\u201d to colliding with wind turbines, compared with other birds. Why? \u201cMany of the areas that are promising sources of wind energy unfortunately also overlap with eagle habitats, and eagles are at risk because their senses tend to be focused upon the ground as they look for prey, rather than staring ahead to see spinning blades,\u201d reported National Geographic.", "Trump falsely claimed shooting an eagle leads to five years in prison. The penalty is a maximum fine of $5,000 or one year imprisonment for the first offense. Trump also misleadingly said that wind turbines \u201care killing hundreds and hundreds of eagles.\u201d It\u2019s possible, but scientists don\u2019t have good estimates for eagle deaths at wind farms across the U.S. because of underreporting and a lack of access to data.", "Editor\u2019s Note: SciCheck is made possible by a grant from the Stanton Foundation.", "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/74c7a064-bfc1-4796-95b9-ceb607dc46a9", "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/e2c3c601-64ad-4976-92e8-8ec59f82acb2", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
