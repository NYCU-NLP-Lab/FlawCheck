["By Robert Farley", "Posted on September 10, 2019", "Twice in the last five weeks, Joe Biden has claimed that despite voting to authorize military force against Iraq in 2002, he opposed the Iraq war from \u201cthe moment\u201d it began. That\u2019s not accurate, and Biden now says he misspoke.", "The public position taken in the lead-up to and early days of the Iraq war has been a litmus test for many presidential candidates.", "Sen. Bernie Sanders proudly boasts about his vote \u2014 while serving as a member of the House in late 2002 \u2014 against authorizing use of military force against Iraq. While running for president, Donald Trump repeatedly claimed that he publicly opposed the Iraq war before the March 19, 2003, invasion, though we looked into it and could find no evidence that he ever did.", "As chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee when the authorization vote was cast, Biden was at the forefront of the debate about what course to pursue with Iraq. As a result, he was also frequently quoted in the press and spoke numerous times from the Senate floor, providing ample evidence of his position over time.", "Biden was a consistent critic of the way the Bush administration handled the war: Its failure to exhaust diplomatic solutions, its failure to enlist a more robust group of allies for the war effort, and the lack of a plan for reconstruction of Iraq. Some of his comments proved to be quite prescient, including his warnings about the likely higher-than-expected cost and length of the war, and the complexity of \u201cwinning the peace\u201d once Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein\u2019s regime was toppled.", "But Biden never outright opposed military action in Iraq in the immediate days after the start of the invasion, as he claimed. He now admits his recent comments went too far.", "During the second Democratic primary debate on July 31, Biden said his \u201cbad judgment\u201d in voting to authorize President George W. Bush to use military force against Iraq in 2002 was \u201ctrusting the president saying he was only doing this to get inspectors in and get the U.N. to agree to put inspectors in.\u201d", "In a speech days before the 2002 vote, Bush did say  approving the resolution \u201cdoes not mean that military action is imminent or unavoidable,\u201d but he also laid out in detail why military action \u201cmay\u201d be needed. And on the day the war broke out, Biden acknowledged, \u201cWe voted to give him the authority to wage that war. We should step back and be supportive.\u201d", "In the Democratic debate, Biden went on to say, \u201cFrom the moment \u2018shock and awe\u2019 started, from that moment, I was opposed to the effort, and I was outspoken as much as anyone at all in the Congress and the administration.\u201d", "During an interview on NPR on Sept. 3, Biden again claimed, \u201cImmediately, the moment [shock and awe] started, I came out against the war at that moment.\u201d", "Biden, Sept. 3: I let my record stand. I think my record has been good. I think the vast majority of the foreign policy community thinks it\u2019s been very good. For example, I got a commitment from President Bush he was not going to go to war in Iraq. He looked me in the eye in the Oval Office; he said he needed the vote to be able to get inspectors into Iraq to determine whether or not Saddam Hussein was engaged in dealing with a nuclear program. He got them in, and before we know it, we had a shock and awe. Immediately, the moment it started, I came out against the war at that moment. Now, the judgment of my trusting the president to keep his word on something like that, that was a mistake. And I apologize for that.", "Last month, when we reached out to the Biden campaign after Biden\u2019s debate comment, a spokesman pointed us to comments Biden made the day before the war began and the day after. In those comments forwarded by the campaign, Biden lamented that the administration had not taken more steps toward a diplomatic solution, and warned of the need for a plan to \u201cwin the peace\u201d after fighting ended.", "But Biden wasn\u2019t against using military action against Iraq to force Iraq to give up weapons of mass destruction (which, as it turned out, it did not have).", "The day the war commenced, Biden told CNN: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of us who voted for giving the president the authority to take down Saddam Hussein if he didn\u2019t disarm. And there are those who believe, at the end of the day, even though it wasn\u2019t handled all that well, we still have to take him down.\u201d", "During a TV interview taped for WMUR in New Hampshire on Sept. 7, Biden acknowledged that he \u201cmisspoke\u201d in the debate and that \u201cthe misrepresentation was how quickly I said I was immediately against the war. I was against the war internally and trying to put together coalitions to try change the way in which the war was conducted.\u201d Biden said he \u201cargued that the way we went to war was wrong, number one. And number two, the way we were conducting the war was wrong.\u201d", "The Biden campaign also provided a statement to the Washington Post acknowledging that \u201cVice President Biden misspoke by saying that he declared his opposition to the war immediately.\u201d", "\u201cHe opposed the way we went to war and the way the war was being carried out,\u201d the statement continued. \u201cHe has for many years called his vote a mistake and takes full responsibility for it. The Bush Administration assured then-Senator Biden that the purpose of the Authorization for the Use of Military Force was to strengthen our position at the U.N. Security Council to get weapons inspectors back into Iraq, and that diplomacy would be exhausted without a premature rush to war. The U.N. element of this strategy worked: after Congress passed the AUMF, the Security Council voted 15-0 to send the inspectors back and Saddam gave them access. However, the Bush Administration plunged the nation into war anyway, without allowing the inspectors to finish their job \u2014 which was profoundly misguided. Once the war began, then-Senator Biden was immediately clear in his opposition to how we got into the conflict and the way it was being conducted \u2014 including the failure to exhaust diplomacy or enlist allies, the reliance on and hyping of faulty intelligence, and the absence of a viable plan to win the peace. He was adamant that, however misguided the war, we owed it to our troops to support them, and he fought for investments like MRAPs [Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles] that saved hundreds of lives from IEDs.\u201d", "Given the issue\u2019s likely prominence in the campaign, we think it\u2019s instructive to review some of the background and Biden\u2019s public statements at several critical junctures.", "In a speech to the nation several days before Congress\u2019 authorization of force vote and five months before the start of the war, the president detailed the case against Iraq, arguing that the country had violated the requirements of the truce that ended the Persian Gulf War in 1991 to \u201cdestroy its weapons of mass destruction, to cease all development of such weapons, and to stop all support for terrorist groups.\u201d He also said Hussein was pursuing the development of nuclear weapons. All of that posed a threat to the U.S., Bush warned.", "\u201cSome believe we can address this danger by simply resuming the old approach to inspections, and applying diplomatic and economic pressure,\u201d Bush said. \u201cYet this is precisely what the world has tried to do since 1991.\u201d And, he said, those methods failed.", "Bush, Oct. 7, 2002: After eleven years during which we have tried containment, sanctions, inspections, even selected military action, the end result is that Saddam Hussein still has chemical and biological weapons and is increasing his capabilities to make more. And he is moving ever closer to developing a nuclear weapon.", "Although Bush called for new, tougher inspections and sanctions, he also made clear that war was an option.", "\u201cThe time for denying, deceiving, and delaying has come to an end,\u201d Bush said. \u201cSaddam Hussein must disarm himself \u2014 or, for the sake of peace, we will lead a coalition to disarm him.\u201d", "\u201cI hope this will not require military action, but it may,\u201d Bush said.", "Three days later, just prior to the vote to authorize military force, Biden gave a lengthy speech from the floor of the Senate and explained why he would vote for the resolution (beginning on S10290).", "Biden said he viewed the resolution not as a \u201crush to war,\u201d as some of his Democratic colleagues alleged, but rather a \u201cmarch to peace and security.\u201d", "\u201cI believe passage of this, with strong support, is very likely to enhance the prospects that the secretary of state will get a strong resolution out of the [United Nations] Security Council,\u201d Biden said.", "Biden added that the resolution would increase the probability the U.N. would get inspectors into Iraq to do meaningful investigations of its weapons program.", "\u201cI will vote for this because we should be compelling Iraq to make good on its obligations to the United Nations,\u201d Biden said. \u201cBecause while Iraq\u2019s illegal weapons of mass destruction program do not \u2014 do not \u2014 pose an imminent threat to our national security, in my view, they will, if left unfettered. And because a strong vote in Congress, as I said, increases the prospect for a tough, new U.N. resolution on weapons of mass destruction, it is likely to get weapons inspectors in, which, in turn, decreases the prospects of war, in my view.\u201d", "Biden seized on this statement in Bush\u2019s address to the nation: \u201cApproving this resolution does not mean that military action is imminent or unavoidable.\u201d", "Biden praised Bush for choosing, up to that point, \u201ca course of moderation and deliberation\u201d and noted that Bush promised that any military action would be \u201cwith allies at our side.\u201d Biden said the resolution emphasized \u201cthe importance of international support, manifested through the United Nations Security Council.\u201d", "Though Biden pushed forcefully for a wider international response, he was not opposed to military action, if necessary.", "\u201cUltimately, either those weapons must be dislodged from Iraq, or Saddam must be dislodged from power,\u201d Biden said.", "It\u2019s true, as Biden has said recently, that he saw the resolution as a means to compel Iraq to allow weapons inspectors back in.", "Biden, Oct. 10, 2002: Concerning Iraq, our first step should be the one the president apparently has chosen: to get the weapons inspectors back into Iraq. \u2026 I agree with President Bush that given a new mandate and the authority to go any place, any time, with no advance warning, U.N. inspections can work. They can succeed in discovering and destroying much of Saddam\u2019s chemical and biological arsenals and his missile program. They can delay and derail his efforts to acquire nuclear weapons and, at the very least, they will give us a clearer picture of what Saddam has, force him to focus on hiding his weapons and not building more, and it will buy us time to build a strong coalition to act if he refuses to disarm.", "Biden argued the resolution \u201cwould finally force Saddam to face the choice between inspectors and invaders \u2026 and there is at least a chance that he might make the right choice.\u201d", "Biden also warned that the cost of a war would be much higher than most Americans believed, and that reconstruction of Iraq would be difficult, costly and likely take a decade \u2014 comments that seem prescient given how events unfolded. But again, Biden said he was not opposed to military action if diplomacy failed.", "\u201cThere is also a chance Saddam will once again miscalculate, that he will misjudge our resolve, and in that event we must be prepared to use force with others if we can, and alone if we must,\u201d Biden said.", "The resolution passed the House 296-133 on Oct. 10, 2002. It passed the Senate the following day 77-33.", "On Nov. 8, 2002, the U.N. Security Council unanimously passed Resolution 1441, which stated that Iraq was \u201cin material breach of its obligations\u201d regarding its disarmament agreements following the Persian Gulf War, and accused Iraq of failing to cooperate with U.N. weapons inspectors and the International Atomic Energy Agency. The resolution offered Hussein \u201ca final opportunity to comply with [Iraq\u2019s] disarmament obligations\u201d and set up \u201can enhanced inspection regime with the aim of bringing to full and verified completion the disarmament process.\u201d The resolution gave Iraq 30 days to provide a complete declaration of \u201call aspects of its programmes to develop chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons, ballistic missiles, and other delivery systems.\u201d", "Biden hailed the move as \u201can important victory for American diplomacy,\u201d and he praised Bush for \u201cforging an international consensus on Saddam\u2019s obligation to disarm.\u201d", "\u201cBy going through the United Nations, we have gained critical international support if it becomes necessary to use force to disarm Saddam,\u201d Biden said.", "In early 2003, the Bush administration began pushing for a second U.N. resolution setting a deadline for Hussein and authorizing military force if necessary to get Hussein to disarm. But the resolution was met with resistance from several key members, including France, Germany, Russia and China.", "In a speech before the U.N. on Feb. 5, 2003, then-Secretary of State Colin Powell said, \u201cThe facts on Iraqis\u2019 behavior \u2026 demonstrate that Saddam Hussein and his regime have made no effort \u2014 no effort \u2014 to disarm as required by the international community. Indeed, the facts on \u2026 Iraq\u2019s behavior show that Saddam Hussein and his regime are concealing their efforts to produce more weapons of mass destruction.\u201d He then laid out the case for that assertion based on U.S. intelligence.", "In an interview hours after Powell\u2019s speech, Biden appeared on CNN and was asked, \u201cDid Secretary of State Powell today close the deal in your mind to those who at least have an open mind about the situation in Iraq?\u201d", "\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Biden said. \u201cHe made a compelling case. The predominance of the evidence, the pure weight of the evidence, I think anyone. \u2026 Let me put it this way, if I were back practicing law I can\u2019t imagine I could not convince an open-minded jury of the facts that he presented as having been true.\u201d", "Biden insisted, however, that \u201cwe may be a step closer to peace. \u2026 The ball, as they say, is in Saddam\u2019s court. \u2026 The security council\u2019s on the line here. They\u2019re either going to prove they are relevant or irrelevant, because I don\u2019t think any open-minded person could argue that Saddam is not in material breach of the U.N. resolution 1441.\u201d", "Biden argued in a Washington Post op-ed on March 10, 2003, that the U.S. ought to seek a second U.N. resolution giving Iraq \u201cmore time for Iraq to meet specific disarmament demands\u201d but also getting a commitment from the U.N. to use force if Iraq failed to meet deadlines.", "Bush ultimately made the decision to go to war with Iraq, which began with the \u201cshock and awe\u201d bombing attack on March 19, 2003. The U.S. was backed with troops from just four other countries: Australia, Denmark, Poland and the United Kingdom. Bush announced that the \u201cmajor military combat actions\u201d in Iraq \u2014 officially dubbed Operation Iraqi Freedom \u2014 ended on May 1, 2003.", "In the hours before bombing began, Biden appeared on CNN and again warned that a large international group would be needed to successfully navigate, and help pay for, the rebuilding of Iraq once the fighting stopped. \u201cAnd so that\u2019s why I hope we begin a new round of diplomacy on, what [happens] after Saddam. Who is going to be in there with us?\u201d Biden said.", "Biden was asked about comments made by fellow Democratic Sen. Tom Daschle two days prior that he was \u201c[s]addened that we have to give up one life because this president couldn\u2019t create the kind of diplomatic effort that was so critical for our country.\u201d", "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of us who voted for giving the president the authority to take down Saddam Hussein if he didn\u2019t disarm,\u201d Biden said. \u201cAnd there are those who believe, at the end of the day, even though it wasn\u2019t handled all that well, we still have to take him down. But what you are sensing from some Democrats, as well as Republicans, is a frustration relating to the lost opportunities of maybe being able to do this with others, maybe, if we had others with us, not even having to go to war. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s anything other than a frustration.", "\u201cBut I think it\u2019s time we stop all that,\u201d Biden said. \u201cWe have one single focus. And that is, we\u2019re about to send our women and men to war. The president is the commander in chief. We voted to give him the authority to wage that war. We should step back and be supportive.\u201d", "On April 2, 2003, Biden was again asked in a CNN interview about Daschle\u2019s comments critical of Bush\u2019s diplomatic efforts. This time, Biden said he \u201cdisagreed\u201d with Daschle, who, like Biden, voted in favor of the authorization of force.", "\u201cThe way the Constitution works is, we voted to give the president the authority to go to war,\u201d Biden said. \u201cIt\u2019s our decision whether or not we go from a state of peace to a state of war. We gave him that authority. You can second guess whether we should have or not. Once we\u2019ve [done] that then it\u2019s his decision to prosecute the war. I wish he had been more successful and more earnest [in] his diplomacy. And my prayer now is \u2026 that he\u2019ll be more successful in diplomacy of how to win the peace. But as the conduct of the war goes, that\u2019s his call.\u201d", "In an interview with Charlie Rose on March 20, 2003, the day after the start of the war, Rose asked about Biden\u2019s comment that the war was the biggest roll of the dice by a president he had seen during his 30 years in the Senate. Biden said that comment referred to \u201cthe willingness to go without any real consensus in the world community.\u201d Rose then asked if there was \u201ca payoff at the end that justifies the risk\u201d of war with Iraq.", "\u201cI think there\u2019s a payoff at the end and that is Saddam Hussein being separated from weapons of mass destruction and enforcing a U.N. commitment made by Saddam about those weapons,\u201d Biden said.", "Later, Rose asked, \u201cIf in fact the war goes well, in however you define that \u2026 would you then say that George Bush made a wise decision in rolling the dice to disarm Saddam Hussein?\u201d", "\u201cI all along, Charlie, believed the right decision is to separate him from his weapons and/or separate him from power,\u201d Biden said.", "\u201cIf the U.N. didn\u2019t do it, do it?\u201d Rose interjected.", "\u201cYes, you\u2019ve gotta do it,\u201d Biden said. \u201cNow, it\u2019s not the time to argue it, but I am disturbed at the lost opportunities we had to bring the rest of the world along with us to this point. \u2026 And now the question is \u2026 can you make lemonade out of lemons here? And I think we have an opportunity in the aftermath of this war to repair those kinds of breaches and end up where we should be anyway, which is having made the right decision to take him down, and having not fractured in any permanent way alliances and opportunities that we\u2019re going to need available to us, Charlie, to deal with other major problems facing us in the world, from the Korean peninsula to South Asia, to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\u201d", "Biden continued to make similar comments in the months after the war started.", "For example, in a Brookings Institution address on July 31, 2003, Biden again defended his vote to authorize the use of military force in Iraq.", "The Bush administration was \u201cright to confront the challenge posed by Saddam thumbing his nose at the world and refusing \u2014 refusing \u2014 to alter his conduct,\u201d Biden said. \u201cContrary to what some in my party might think, Iraq was a problem that had to be dealt with sooner, rather than later. So I commend the president. He was right to enforce the solemn commitments made by Saddam. If they were not enforced \u2026 what good would they\u00a0be and what value those institutions? For me,\u00a0the issue was never\u00a0whether we had to deal with Saddam, but when and how we dealt with Saddam. And it\u2019s precisely the when and how that I think this administration got wrong. We went to war too soon. We went to war with too few troops. We went to war without the world, when we could have had many with us, and we\u2019re paying the price for it now.\u201d", "It wasn\u2019t until Nov. 27, 2005, that Biden acknowledged on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that his 2002 vote authorizing force in Iraq was \u201ca mistake.\u201d", "\u201cIt was a mistake,\u201d Biden said. \u201cIt was a mistake to assume the president would use the authority we gave him properly. \u2026 We gave the president the authority to unite the world to isolate Saddam. And the fact of the matter is, we went too soon. We went without sufficient force. And we went without a plan.\u201d", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
