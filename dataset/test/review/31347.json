They debated on Oct. 10.", "Seniors are among the most consistent election participants in part because they\u2019re reliant on the largest U.S. safety net programs.", "So it would be politically risky for a candidate to declare his desire to cut Medicare and Social Security. And yet, Democrat Dan McCready recently accused Republican Mark Harris of admitting just that.", "Harris and McCready are running for North Carolina\u2019s 9th Congressional District, which stretches from Charlotte to south-central North Carolina. It\u2019s currently held by Robert Pittenger, who Harris beat in the Republican primary.", "There are 116,000 people in the 9th district over 65 (the age at which most people become eligible for Medicare and full Social Security benefits) and about 100,000 more who stand to collect Social Security benefits within the next 15 years, NC political expert\u00a0Michael Bitzer recently told the Charlotte Observer.", "In a debate on Oct. 10, things got heated between Harris and McCready after a moderator asked about how they\u2019d continue to pay for Social Security.", "\"Mark Harris has said he would cut Social Security and Medicare,\" McCready said.", "The full debate is available on the Charlotte Observer\u00a0website, and McCready made this claim around the 12-minute mark of the video.", "Harris said he was offended by McCready\u2019s accusation.", "\"I have never said that. That is a lie that\u2019s being perpetrated throughout the campaign and throughout the district,\" Harris said. \"I have always said we\u2019ve got to keep Social Security solvent, we\u2019ve got to make sure that it\u2019s a promise made and a promise kept. And we will continue to do that.\"", "Harris then accused McCready of wanting to raise taxes to support those programs. He continued: \"I do think we need to look at a graduated system that keeps the promise we\u2019ve made to those that are retired and are heading toward retirement. I think when you get further back in the younger years, we need to have a graduated program that may involve options.\"", "McCready\u2019s argument", "McCready then presented a three-pronged argument for how Harris has indicated intentions to cut Medicare and Social Security.", "\"You supported a $1.9 trillion tax bill that takes $25 billion out of Medicare,\" McCready said to Harris.", "\"You\u2019ve said you would join the Freedom Caucus, whose stated purpose is to reform Social Security as we know it,\" McCready said.", "\"And you said in 2014 at the Lake Norman debate that younger people would be the big loser under your plan.\"", "Harris responded by saying, \"I\u2019ve never expressed an overall plan except to make the point that younger people today who do not see Social Security being there when they reach it need to have some kind of options in place.\"", "Contacted by PolitiFact, McCready\u2019s campaign emailed\u00a0video of a 2014 U.S. Senate primary debate\u00a0Harris participated in, a link to an\u00a0online voter guide\u00a0Harris filled out for this year\u2019s primary and two news stories \u2014 by the\u00a0Washington Post\u00a0and\u00a0Reuters\u00a0\u2014 about how Republicans want to cut entitlement programs to compensate for revenue losses from the recent tax cut.", "The tax cuts and Freedom Caucus", "The Republican tax cuts are projected to shorten the life expectancy of the programs, as PolitiFact has previously reported. The tax law trimmed a year of solvency from the primary Medicare trust fund and had a negative effect on the Social Security trust fund, PolitiFact reported in a\u00a0fact check of President Donald Trump.", "But it\u2019s unfair for McCready to say that, because Harris supports the tax cuts, he by extension supports further cuts to Medicare. PolitiFact couldn\u2019t find evidence that Harris has explicitly said he wants to cut Medicare, and McCready\u2019s camp didn\u2019t provide any.", "As for the Freedom Caucus, Harris has said\u00a0he\u2019d join the conservative group. Mark Meadows, a Freedom Caucus leader,\u00a0says on his website\u00a0that \"Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid must be at the center of any serious proposal to return spending to sustainable levels.\"", "However, Meadows adds, \"I do not support seriously proposing radical changes to current or soon-to-be retirees\u2019 benefits. But if we are to continue providing these safety-nets for Americans in need we must renegotiate expectations with younger Americans. This could include increasing the retirement age for those just starting their careers, raising or eliminating the cap on payroll taxes for higher wage earners and creating incentives for personal retirement and health care savings.\"", "What has Harris said?", "Now let\u2019s look at the 2014 debate and the voter guide.", "In the video of the debate, Harris sounds a lot like Meadows. Harris says everyone currently over 50 should be guaranteed that they will get Social Security when they retire, but younger people shouldn\u2019t receive that same guarantee.", "\"There may be a way that we\u2019re able to scale back for others that are under 50. I\u2019ll soon be 48, and \u2026 my generation may very well be the big loser in Social Security, but we may be able to say that at least I took care of my parents and my grandparents with what I paid into it.\"", "He continued: \"I would rather, quite frankly, have you make the adjustment on me as a man about to turn 48, and free my children \u2013 age 25, 24, and 22 up \u2013 instead of continuing to tax them and put money into a system that they will never, ever see a dime out of it. So we\u2019ve got to come up with a solution that will hit those generations and it\u2019s got to be thoughtful and it\u2019s got to be productive, but it is something that we can, we can work on and fix.\"", "Harris\u2019 response to iVoterGuide.com \u2014 completed for the Republican primary in this race \u2014 is similar. Harris wrote that Social Security is \"in a death spiral\" and \"needs to be overhauled.\"", "\"However, we must honor our promises to existing retirees and those nearing retirement age keeping the current system in place for those folks,\" Harris wrote in the guide. \"In order to sustain a system that resembles Social Security, the system will need to operate in a balanced manner meaning that individuals only receive what they pay in, supplemented if desired by a government budget that should be based not on the whims of political gain but economic sensibility.\"", "Our ruling", "McCready claimed Harris \"has said he would cut Social Security and Medicare.\" PolitiFact couldn\u2019t find an example of Harris describing a plan for changing Social Security and Medicare benefits for the people who get them now or stand to get them soon.", "On Medicare, McCready has failed to prove that Harris said he wants to cut the program at all.", "But on Social Security, it\u2019s clear from his past and recent statements that his hopes for reform include changes that would limit future government payouts. Harris has used the word \"overhaul\" and said he\u2019s open to scaling back Social Security for people under 50. However, he\u2019s consistently said his desired reforms wouldn\u2019t affect people who are in the program or stand to benefit from it in the next decade or so.", "We rate this claim Half True.", "This story was produced by the North Carolina Fact-Checking Project, a partnership of McClatchy Carolinas, the Duke University Reporters\u2019 Lab and PolitiFact.
