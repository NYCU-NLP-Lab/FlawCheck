["By Robert Farley", "Posted on November 11, 2019", "President Donald Trump continues to muddle the timeline of events to falsely suggest that the White House release of a memo summarizing his July phone call with the president of Ukraine silenced whistleblowers and contradicted Democratic leaders.", "Contrary to Trump\u2019s claims:", "The whistleblower complaint was filed on Aug. 12. However, the first rough outlines of the complaint only began to trickle out publicly in mid-September, beginning with an anonymously sourced story in the Washington Post on Sept. 18. Several days later, the Wall Street Journal, again citing anonymous sources,\u00a0reported that Trump \u201cin a July phone call repeatedly pressured the president of Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden\u2019s son,\u201d and urged President Volodymyr Zelensky to \u201cwork with Rudy Giuliani on a probe that could hamper Mr. Trump\u2019s potential 2020 opponent.\u201d", "Here\u2019s the order of events that happened next over three days in late September.", "On Sept. 24, Pelosi announced that the House would begin an impeachment inquiry.", "On Sept. 25, the White House released a memo of the call, which confirmed that Trump asked Zelensky to investigate the Bidens. The memo isn\u2019t a verbatim transcript, but rather the notes taken by assigned staff.", "On Sept. 26, the House intelligence committee released a redacted copy of the whistleblower complaint.", "In his repeated retelling of events, however, Trump falsely claims that the White House release of the memo silenced the complaints, or contradicted them.", "Trump, to reporters, Nov. 4: I think that the whistleblower gave a lot of false information. And you have to see who the whistleblower is. Once I released the transcript, which was almost immediately, the whistleblower\u2019s report was very wrong, because as you know, the whistleblower covered mostly my transcript \u2014 my call \u2014 my call with the president of Ukraine. So once I released that call \u2014 I released a very detailed version of that call \u2014 all of a sudden, the whistleblower\u2019s report was incorrect. And the whistleblower seems to have disappeared. And I also wonder what happened to the second whistleblower. And what happened to the informant. They all disappeared once I released the report.", "Trump, at a rally in Monroe, Louisiana, Nov. 6: You know the whistleblower? The one that came out with this \u201cTrump said this and Trump said that.\u201d And then when they heard my real phone call the whistleblower disappeared. Shifty Schiff, he\u2019s a corrupt politician. Schiff didn\u2019t want to have the whistleblower anymore because nobody thought I was going to release the phone call. \u2026 But the whistleblower, before they knew I was going to release, he came out with a whistleblower, you know, like he\u2019s some wonderful person. Take a look at the whistleblower. But the whistleblower came out with his horrible statement about this call, so I really had no choice. I said immediately \u2014 talk about transparency. I said, \u201cRelease it, Release it immediately.\u201d And then, the whistleblower saw it and shifty Schiff saw it, he\u2019s a total crook. Schiff saw it. Pelosi saw it, and they said, we\u2019ve got a problem. We don\u2019t want to have anything to do with the whistleblower anymore and the whistleblower disappeared. You know who else disappeared? The second whistleblower. And you know who else disappeared? The informer to the whistleblower if there was such a person, which I doubt, which I doubt.", "Trump, in a tweet, Nov. 4: The Whistleblower gave false information & dealt with corrupt politician Schiff. He must be brought forward to testify. Written answers not acceptable! Where is the 2nd Whistleblower? He disappeared after I released the transcript. Does he even exist? Where is the informant? Con!", "Trump, in an interview with WKYT-TV in Lexington, Nov. 4: And I think the whistleblower is very suspect, because \u2026 what he wrote is very wrong, and I released the conversation. And when we released the conversation the whistleblower \u2014 he disappeared. Everybody sort of disappeared after I did that.", "Trump packs a lot of misinformation into those statements.", "For starters, it\u2019s not true that the memo of the call showed the whistleblower complaint to be \u201cfalse\u201d and \u201ctotally wrong,\u201d as Trump has repeatedly claimed.\u00a0As we have written, the whistleblower\u2019s account of the July phone call largely matches up with the White House-released memo.", "Specifically, the whistleblower made these three claims that were corroborated by the memo: Trump asked Zelensky to \u201cinitiate or continue an investigation\u201d into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden; assist the U.S. in investigating allegations that \u201cRussian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election originated in Ukraine\u201d; and \u201cmeet or speak\u201d about these matters with Trump\u2019s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, and Attorney General William Barr.", "At a House intelligence committee hearing on Sept. 26, Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire testified\u00a0that the whistleblower\u2019s complaint \u201cis in alignment with what was released yesterday by the president.\u201d", "Contrary to Trump\u2019s claims, the whistleblower did not \u201cdisappear\u201d after the release of the memo. From the beginning, the whistleblower has resisted being unmasked, and federal law states that the identity of a whistleblower cannot be disclosed without their consent. In an Oct. 25 op-ed for the Washington Post, the whistleblower\u2019s attorneys argued that \u201cthe identity of the whistleblower is irrelevant.\u201d", "\u201cMuch of what has been disclosed since the release of our client\u2019s complaint actually exceeds the whistleblower\u2019s knowledge of what transpired at the time the complaint was submitted,\u201d Andrew P. Bakaj and Mark S. Zaid wrote. That includes release of the summarized transcript of the call, text messages provided to the House of Representatives by the former U.S. special representative for Ukraine, and congressional testimony from numerous government officials involved in the activities highlighted by the whistleblower. \u201cBecause our client has no additional information about the president\u2019s call, there is no justification for exposing their identity and all the risks that would follow.\u201d", "But the whistleblower has not \u201cdisappeared.\u201d The whistleblower\u2019s attorneys nixed the idea of him testifying privately in person before Congress, or perhaps remotely with his identity protected. But the lawyers for the whistleblower have notified both the House and Senate intelligence committees that the whistleblower is willing to respond in writing to questions and under oath.", "As for the second whistleblower \u201cdisappearing\u201d after the White House release of the phone call memo, that doesn\u2019t jibe with the timeline.", "The second whistleblower, who works in the intelligence community, did not come forward until the first week of October, more than a week after the White House released its memo. Zaid, one of the attorneys representing the original whistleblower, told ABC News Chief Anchor George Stephanopoulos on Oct. 6 that he was now representing a second whistleblower.", "Zaid said the second whistleblower had not filed a complaint but had spoken to the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general and that the person had \u201cfirst hand knowledge that supported the first whistleblower.\u201d Zaid tweeted that his client \u201cmade a protected disclosure under the law and cannot be retaliated against.\u201d According to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, \u201cWhistleblowing can range from a simple conversation with a supervisor, to contacting an Inspector General (IG) Hotline, to providing information, through the proper channels, to Congress. In each instance of lawful whistleblowing, an individual is getting the right information to the right people.\u201d", "Even more absurd is Trump\u2019s claim that the \u201cinformer to the whistleblower if there was such a person, which I doubt\u201d has also disappeared since release of the memo. The original whistleblower, described by the New York Times as a CIA officer who was detailed to the National Security Council, wrote in his complaint that while he did not participate in Trump\u2019s phone call with the Ukrainian president, \u201cin the course of official interagency business\u201d he was informed about details of the phone call by \u201cmultiple White House officials with direct knowledge of the call.\u201d", "As we wrote when Trump made similar claims, given that the original whistleblower did not participate directly in the Ukraine phone call, and yet got key details about it correct, it stands to reason he was provided that information by an informant.", "More important, numerous government officials have now testified before House committees about the phone call and other aspects of the whistleblower\u2019s complaint, and have confirmed its key points. (See \u201cThe Whistleblower Complaint Timeline\u201d for more information.)", "Trump also has altered the timeline regarding a rendition of the phone call that Schiff, the chairman of the House intelligence committee, gave prior to the Sept. 26 testimony of Acting Director of National Intelligence Maguire. Although Trump claims Schiff was \u201cembarrassed\u201d by the subsequent release of the phone call memo, the memo was released a day before Schiff\u2019s remarks at the beginning of the House hearing.", "Trump, at Values Voter Summit, Oct. 12: This crooked Adam Schiff made a statement \u2014 long, beautiful statement \u2014 and it was a fraud. He repeated my call, but it wasn\u2019t me. He made it so bad. \u2026 But then I did something that they didn\u2019t expect. I immediately called up Ukraine, through my representatives. \u2026 I got approval to immediately make that call public. \u2026 I heard it [Schiff\u2019s version], I said, \u201cThat\u2019s not what I said.\u201d He made up a conversation. And it was vicious what he said. And then we caught him. \u2026 By the way, [Schiff] only did it because he never thought that I was going to release the transcript. \u2026 He did it and then I released the transcript. They never thought in a million years, even in terms of violation with another country, but we got the approval. So, he\u2019s very embarrassed.", "Trump, at a rally in Lexington, Kentucky, Nov. 4: How about Schiff? He makes up a conversation. He gets up before the United States Congress. He repeats my conversation with the head of the Ukraine, the new president, a good guy, repeats it. I said, \u201cI never said that.\u201d He made a horrible statement. It was a total lie, and then, I actually went and released the actual conversation, and you haven\u2019t heard about the whistleblower after that. Have you?", "As we said, Trump gets the order backward. At the Sept. 26 House intelligence committee hearing, Schiff presented a dramatic retelling of Trump\u2019s phone call with Zelensky that Schiff said was partly\u00a0\u201cin parody.\u201d As we have previously written, Schiff said he was recounting \u201cthe essence of what the president communicates\u201d in his call with Zelensky \u201cin not so many words.\u201d", "Some of what Schiff said was similar to the White House\u2019s memo of the phone call. But Schiff also embellished the conversation, claiming, for example, that Trump told Zelensky, \u201cyou better listen good. I want you to make up dirt on my political opponent.\u201d Trump never said anything about making up dirt, according to the White House memo on the July 25 phone call. As we\u2019ve written\u00a0before, we\u2019ll leave it for readers to judge whether it was immediately clear that Schiff was purposefully giving his own dramatic representation that didn\u2019t completely square with the facts.", "However, Schiff wasn\u2019t surprised and \u201cembarrassed\u201d by the release of the memo of the call, because, as Trump claimed, Schiff \u201cnever thought that I was going to release the transcript.\u201d Indeed, the memo had been publicly released by the White House the day before, on Sept. 25.", "Trump also falsely characterized Pelosi\u2019s reaction to the White House-released memo.", "For example, at a rally in Lake Charles, Louisiana, on Oct. 11, Trump said: \u201cNancy Pelosi said, \u2018Well, that\u2019s what he said. Isn\u2019t it?\u2019 But she was angry as hell when she got to read the transcript. Because she said, \u2018Wait a minute, that\u2019s not what I was told.\u2019 But she was stuck, she was stuck.\u201d", "At another rally in Louisiana on Nov. 6, Trump said that when Pelosi read the White House memo of the call, she said, \u201cWe\u2019ve got a problem.\u201d", "Pelosi did announce that the House would begin an impeachment inquiry the day before the White House released the phone call memo, and two days before the public release of a redacted copy of the whistleblower\u2019s complaint.", "But on the day the White House memo of the call was released, Pelosi did not express concerns that she had misrepresented Trump\u2019s actions in calling for the impeachment inquiry. Rather, in a released statement, she said, \u201cThe release of the notes of the call by the White House confirms that the President engaged in behavior that undermines the integrity of our elections, the dignity of the office he holds and our national security.\u201d", "\u201cEither the President does not know the weight of his words or he does not care about ethics or his constitutional responsibilities,\u201d Pelosi stated. \u201cThe transcript and the Justice Department\u2019s acting in a rogue fashion in being complicit in the President\u2019s lawlessness confirm the need for an impeachment inquiry. Clearly, the Congress must act.\u201d", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
