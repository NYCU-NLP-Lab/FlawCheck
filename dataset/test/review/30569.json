This year was somewhat different.", "The biggest news in the 2017 rules package was an amendment to curb the power of the independent Office of Congressional Ethics. After a big public backlash and critical tweets by President-elect Donald Trump, the amendment was withdrawn.", "Somewhat less widely noticed, but which has come up periodically in pro-Democratic web posts and social media, was a provision that seemed to prevent the Congressional Budget Office from analyzing the cost of repealing the Affordable Care Act. If true, this would be significant, since the CBO, Congress\u2019 number-crunching arm, is a respected independent referee on questions of how much legislative proposals will cost the federal treasury.", "If this happened, it would make it easier for Republicans to avoid answering the question of why they want to repeal a law at significant cost to the U.S. treasury.", "At least one lawmaker made an issue of this rules provision on Twitter:\u00a0Rep. Keith Ellison, D-Minn., who has taken on a higher profile due to his bid to become the next Democratic National Committee chairman.", "\"House GOP rules package bars CBO from counting spikes in deficit spending spurred by an ACA repeal,\" Ellison tweeted on Jan. 5, 2017.

These were the two legislative vehicles that were used to enact President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health care law.", "What the provision actually means", "But while Ellison tweeted that the package \"bars CBO from counting spikes in deficit spending spurred by an ACA repeal,\" it actually doesn\u2019t say CBO can\u2019t analyze the law\u2019s costs.", "Rather, the provision in the rules package lifts the requirement that CBO track the cost of repeal or reform over the unusually long period mandated by the rules provision -- that is, 50 years after the first year CBO measures. Analyses over more typical -- and shorter -- time periods are not barred.", "\"People have misinterpreted this exemption to conclude that CBO wouldn't provide a cost estimate for ACA legislation at all,\" said Ed Lorenzen, a senior advisor to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget and a former senior aide to House Democratic Leader Steny Hoyer of Maryland. \"But the exemption only applies to the new requirement for additional information regarding long-term costs in CBO estimates of legislation.\"", "The Congressional Budget Act requires a cost estimate covering the next 10 years for all legislation considered by Congress, he said, and \"the rules package doesn\u2019t change that.\"", "Lorenzen added that the rules package doesn\u2019t prevent CBO from making a long-term analysis of the costs of an ACA repeal \u2014 it just says that doing such an analysis isn\u2019t mandatory.", "\"There\u2019s obviously a difference between saying something is not required and actually prohibiting it,\" Lorenzen said. \"There\u2019s reason to believe that CBO would probably provide information about a ballpark estimate of budgetary effects of legislation related to the Affordable Care Act beyond the 10-ten year window even without a requirement to do so, given the magnitude of the impact and interest among members of Congress in the long term budgetary effects of the ACA.\"", "Lorenzen said that he and his organization would have opposed a provision of the type Ellison assumes in his tweet. \"But that\u2019s not what\u2019s happening here,\" he said.", "Donald Wolfensberger, a former House Rules Committee aide who is now a scholar at the Woodrow Wilson International Center, agreed with Lorenzen\u2019s analysis.", "\"This is a new point of order and exemption from it, and implicitly does not alter existing budget rules and requirements, including the ability of CBO to make cost estimates,\" Wolfensberger said.", "Ellison\u2019s office backed off after PolitiFact relayed Lorenzen\u2019s analysis and acknowledged that the interpretation in the tweet was incorrect.", "Our ruling", "Ellison tweeted that the \"House GOP rules package bars CBO from counting spikes in deficit spending spurred by an ACA repeal.\"", "In reality, the rules package doesn\u2019t bar CBO analysis of ACA repeal proposals. Rather, the rules package says that CBO is not required to conduct an extra-long-term analysis that goes 50 years into the future, although the office could do one if it wants.
