["About this rating", "In late October 2020, Snopes readers inquired about news stories circulating online reporting on an unusual Halloween yard display. Texas resident Angela Nava had arranged multiple skeletons in her yard to create a detailed \"skeleton strip club,\" complete with pole dancers, patrons, and a bouncer.", "Our attempts to reach Nava by phone and via social media messages were unsuccessful, however the display is real, as demonstrated by images posted by local television news outlets that covered the story:", "Nava told Houston's KTRK-TV that she dubbed her Halloween set-up \"the Candy Shop.\"", "\"Every night we change the positions of the skeletons, or who's joining the club, or just different participants, and it's really been just a very great creative outlet for me,\" she said in a remote interview with the TV station. \"And it just all started because of COVID [the COVID-19 pandemic].
