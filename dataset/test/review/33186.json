It holds the licenses to produce eyewear for global fashion brands such as Chanel, Armani, Prada and Michael Kors and manages the distribution of its products through 200,000 wholesale doors. In 2014, the Italian company generated over \u20ac7.6 billion (about $8.5 billion) in revenue.

A single, huge international corporation owns three of the four eyeglass stores listed. And the fourth? Out of business. Think you'll try your luck at Sears? Don't bother. The same company you've never heard of controls their eyewear department, too.

It now controls 20 percent of the retail market in the United States, including ownership of national chain stores, such as LensCrafters and Pearle Vision. On top of it all, you\u2019re paying way too much. From the local doctor\u2019s office to the well-known retail chain, these places mark up the price of your frames and lenses by about 250 percent.", "Over the past 5 years, Luxottica, the world\u2019s largest corporate player in the eyeglasses industry, steadily bought up other companies. Today, the company owns 30 different brands of frames, including Anne Klein, Burberry, DKNY, Oakley, Polo, Ralph Lauren, Ray-Ban, Versace and Vogue. It also controls retail shops, including LensCrafters, Pearle Vision, Sears Optical and Target Optical. And it owns the EyeMed Vision Care group, a vision insurance company. It makes its frames in company-owned plants in China and Italy and sells them in about 130 countries, so it\u2019s no surprise that Luxottica also owns China\u2019s Modern Sight Optics, a leading Chinese optical retailer.", "To us, that\u2019s quite a vertical integration that could present problems for consumers. To FTC, it appears to be business as usual. FTC investigated Luxottica\u2019s acquisitions in 2004, after the company acquired Pearle Vision, says Michael Moiseyev, assistant director, mergers, in the Bureau of Competition. But the agency decided Luxottica\u2019s takeovers did not constitute a monopoly, Moiseyev says, because \u201cit only accounts for 20 percent of the market, so it\u2019s not the kind of volume that gives us cause for concern.\u201d", "In 2015, New York State Senator Chuck Schumer proposed changes to the FTC's Eyeglass Rule of 1992, enacted to ensure that patients were not locked into purchasing overpriced glasses because of monopolies. In a 27 September 2015 press release, Schumer's office cited the \"80 percent\" figure for Luxoticca's market share:", "Standing at LensCrafters, U.S. Senator Charles E. Schumer today urged the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to modernize its \u201cEyeglass Rule\u201d to allow for 21st-century competition by allowing patients to obtain a full copy of their eyeglass prescriptions so they can take that prescription anywhere they want\u2014even online. Under current law, patients are not entitled to their full prescription, a situation that often forces them to pay more when buying glasses. Schumer explained that, while more than 200 million Americans are affected by vision loss, the average price for a pair of eyeglasses is a whopping $300 with no end in sight.", "Luxoticca, an Italian company, which owns LensCrafters and more than 80 percent of eyewear brands. For instance, Luxoticca makes frames for well-known brands like Burberry, Prada, and Tory Burch. In addition, Luxoticca owns several other popular American eyeglass chains such as Pearle Vision, Sears Optical and Target Optical. Schumer explained that Luxoticca has a monopoly-like hold over the eyewear industry and that this push, along with other actions, could help weaken this hold. Additionally, many health plans do not adequately cover eye care, while forces patients to pay out of pocket.", "On 30 September 2015, industry publication Optometry Times covered the same issue and suggested that Senator Schumer was \"misinformed\":", "\"I feel Senator Schumer maybe a little misinformed here,\u201d says Optometry Times Chief Optometric Editor Ernie Bowling, OD, FAAO. \u201cThere are lots of online retailers available to the public. I really don't see competition or consumer choice in eyewear to be an issue right now ... When discussing the information needed to fill a prescription, we are really talking about the spectacle PD. I give the PD to every patient as part of his written prescription,\u201d says Dr. Bowling. \u201cI don't think it's worth alienating a patient over a PD. But we do educate the patient about their choices in eyewear. There is a huge service component that goes in to measuring and fitting spectacles that you're not getting with an online retailer.\u201d", "Luxottica provided a September 2015 statement to Optometry Times that reiterated the (less than) 20 percent market share figure cited by Consumers Digest:", "We were surprised to see how Senator Schumer presented our business and our industry in his public statement regarding the FTC\u2019s\neyeglass rule.
