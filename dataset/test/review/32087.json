["Social media users are sharing a photoshopped tweet that claims U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., called for a \"purge\" of conservatives now that Joe Biden has been elected president.", "The tweet\u00a0appeared after President Donald Trump's supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6\u00a0and before\u00a0Ocasio-Cortez's video\u00a0made on Jan. 12, in which she called the president a \"traitor\" to the country and said she feared for her safety during the riot.", "\"Congrats to President Joe Biden. Now let's begin 'The Purge' to roundup all Conservative traitors,\" the alleged tweet reads, posted by one user\u00a0as a screenshot to Facebook\u00a0on Jan. 12. \"Democrats, let's make Auschwitz look like a picnic!\"", "Many users across Facebook have shared the same screenshot, which includes Ocasio-Cortez's profile picture from\u00a0her personal Twitter account and a blue checkmark. The tweet has no date or timestamp. USA TODAY reached out to the Facebook users for comment.", "The claim is false and there is no evidence of the tweet ever having appeared on Ocasio-Cortez's Twitter accounts.", "Fact check: Trump loses several perks only with impeachment conviction by Jan. 20", "The image has been altered, and a search of\u00a0Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s personal and official Twitter accounts comes up with no such tweets referencing \"the purge.\"", "While some\u00a0users claimed that she had deleted the tweet,\u00a0a search on ProPublica's \"Politwoops\" database\u00a0that tracks\u00a0tweets deleted by elected officials\u00a0also results in no matches under Ocasio-Cortez's deleted tweets.", "On Jan. 14, Ocasio-Cortez addressed the fake tweet on her personal Twitter account and wrote, \"FYI there is (yet another) viral misinformation campaign going on, this time a false tweet that\u2019s been photoshopped to look like I sent out a call for a 'purge.'\"", "This is not the first time Ocasio-Cortez has been the target of fake tweets circulating on social media. USA TODAY recently debunked the claim that\u00a0Ocasio-Cortez authored a tweet that her shoes were stolen during the Capitol riot.", "In July,\u00a0social media users falsely claimed\u00a0that Ocasio-Cortez tweeted that governors should maintain restrictions on businesses until after the election.", "Fact check: No record of viral Nancy Pelosi quote about immigrants who are here illegally", "The claim that Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted that Democrats should begin \"the purge\" and round up \"Conservative traitors\" is FALSE, based on our research. She\u00a0confirmed on Twitter that the tweet is fake, and there is no record of the tweet on her official Twitter account or ProPublica's Politwoops archive.", "Thank you for supporting our journalism.
