He also brought up Hillary Clinton\u2019s record on human rights.", "\"A woman who pretends to be a feminist shouldn't be taking money from countries where women are stoned, where women are killed for adultery, and women can't drive,\" Giuliani said. \"She's taken hundreds of millions from those countries.\"", "Giuliani was referring to the Clinton Foundation, which has brought in significant amounts of money from foreign entities and governments to fund its international charitable programs.", "One of the biggest concerns about the Clinton Foundation is that some of this foreign money came from countries with questionable records on human rights, as well as countries that had business before the State Department while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state.", "On this particular claim, though, Giuliani stretches the truth. The donations from the countries in question do not come close to \"hundreds of millions\" of dollars. And the money goes to the foundation, not to Clinton.", "Giuliani specifically mentioned countries where women are stoned, killed for adultery and can\u2019t drive. By our count \u2014 using the State Department\u2019s Country Reports on Human Rights Practices and Cornell University\u2019s death penalty database \u2014 we found four countries who fall loosely into these categories: Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates and Bahrain.", "Here\u2019s a chart laying out those countries\u2019 stance on adultery, stoning and women driving, and donations to the Clinton Foundation. (The foundation lists donors on its website, organized into groups based on the size of the donation, without giving the specific dollar amount.)", "Country", "Donation to Clinton Foundation", "Women\u2019s rights issues", "Saudi Arabia", "$10 million - $25 million", "Women are not allowed to drive. Adultery is illegal, and perpetrators can be sentenced to death by stoning.", "Kuwait", "$5 million - $10 million", "Lenient sentence for a person who kills someone caught in the act of adultery.", "United Arab Emirates", "$1 million - $5 million", "Sharia courts allow flogging as a punishment for adultery, and stoning is a form of execution.", "Bahrain", "$50,000 - $100,000", "Lenient sentence for a person who kills someone caught in the act of adultery.", "In total, the Clinton Foundation brought in between $16.05 million and $40.1 million. That\u2019s not a small number, but it\u2019s nowhere near \"hundreds of millions.\" Saudi Arabia is the clearest example of what Giuliani is talking about, and it donated a maximum of $25 million.", "We should note that outside the narrow band of countries that ban women from driving and stone them for adultery, a few other countries with other women\u2019s rights issues donated to the Clinton Foundation.", "For example, Qatar, which donated between $1 million and $5 million, allows for flogging (non-lethal) as a punishment for adultery. And Brunei, which donated between $1 million and $5 million, specifically says spousal intercourse cannot be considered rape.", "But even if you expand the group of foundation donors to countries that have significant women\u2019s rights issues generally, the donations do not amount to \"hundreds of millions\" of dollars.", "It\u2019s also important to note Giuliani\u2019s phrasing. He said, \"She's taken hundreds of millions from those countries,\" referring to Hillary Clinton herself.", "But the donations did not go to Clinton personally; they went to the foundation. While Clinton has been intimately involved in the foundation when not serving in the government or running for office, neither Clinton nor her political campaigns have ever received a direct monetary benefit, such as a salary, from the foundation.", "Our ruling", "Giuliani said Hillary Clinton has \"taken hundreds of millions from those countries\" where \"women are stoned, where women are killed for adultery and women can't drive.\"", "The Clinton Foundation, not Clinton personally, has taken in tens of millions of dollars, not hundreds of millions, from countries that have questionable records on women\u2019s rights, including those that ban driving and stone women for adultery.", "Giuliani\u2019s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.
