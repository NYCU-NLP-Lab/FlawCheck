We watched the video frame-by-frame and were able to establish that it is the same video. In the comparison posted below, we have matched two frames \u2013 one from the AP\u2019s video and another from the viral video \u2013 to establish that it has been clipped from the latter.", "If one compares the audio and the video of the original footage with the viral video, it can be said that the 2:03-minute video has been manufactured by repeating visuals from the 1:18-minute original video.
