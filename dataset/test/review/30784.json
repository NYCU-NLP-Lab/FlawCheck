Here, we\u2019ll take on the claim about McCain.", "It dates back to a Trump an event in Ames, Iowa, on July 18, 2015. Trump, referring to McCain, R-Ariz., said \"he\u2019s not a war hero.\" McCain spent five and a half years in a Vietnamese prison camp.", "Trump\u2019s comments were criticized by many of his then-competitors for the Republican presidential nomination. Texas Gov. Rick Perry, for example, said Trump was \"unfit\" to be commander-in-chief for his remarks \u2014 the very point Clinton aimed to make throughout her speech.", "Since then, Trump has claimed repeatedly that his statements were misinterpreted. We have looked at Trump\u2019s statements before, but we wanted to re-examine the issue to see whether Clinton\u2019s characterization of Trump\u2019s words is accurate.", "The feud", "The bad blood between McCain and Trump started on July 16, 2015, when McCain said Trump had \"fired up the crazies\" at an Arizona anti-immigration rally.", "A few days later in Iowa, Trump fired back during an interview with Republican pollster Frank Luntz. Trump accused McCain of not doing enough for veterans and proceeded to call McCain a \"loser,\" at which point Luntz expressed incredulity, noting multiple times that McCain was a war hero. Here\u2019s the back-and-forth:", "Luntz: \"He\u2019s a war hero.

I believe, perhaps, he\u2019s a war hero. But right now he said some very bad things about a lot of people. So what I said is John McCain, I disagree with him that these people aren\u2019t crazy.\"", "Clinton would certainly be correct accusing Trump of saying McCain is not a war hero, which he does right off the bat. Trump does attempt to walk it back immediately, but he does so with caveats that continue to question McCain\u2019s service -- suggesting he is only a war hero because he was captured -- and seemingly mock captured soldiers.", "Also, in a press conference immediately after the rally, Trump insisted he was not blaming McCain for being captured. On a radio show May 11, 2016, Trump also said McCain is a hero.", "\"You know frankly, I like John McCain, and John McCain is a hero,\" Trump said on the Imus in the Morning radio show.", "In an interview on the O\u2019Reilly Factor on July 20, 2015, Trump told Bill O\u2019Reilly that he would \"take back his remarks\" if there was a \"misunderstanding,\" adding that he has since corrected them to express what he meant.", "Clinton\u2019s comments", "Clinton\u2019s remarks can be interpreted in different ways.

In the press conference immediately after the rally, Trump said that all prisoners are war heroes, with the exception of Bowe Bergdahl.", "\"If a person is captured, they\u2019re a hero as far as I\u2019m concerned, unless they are a traitor,\" Trump said.", "Trump also explained his comments about liking veterans who weren\u2019t captured, saying that soldiers, both captured and not-captured, deserve credit.", "\"You have many people who didn\u2019t get captured, I respect them greatly. You have many people who did get captured, I respect them greatly also,\" Trump said.", "Trump also pivoted back to his main talking point -- that McCain has failed to advocate for veterans in the Senate (a statement we have previously rated False).", "Our ruling", "Clinton accused Trump in a speech Thursday of having \"the gall to say that prisoners of war like John McCain aren\u2019t heroes.\"", "In one sense, she has a point. Trump did in fact say that John McCain is not a hero despite his POW record, although Trump has since taken those comments back and called McCain a hero.", "However, Clinton\u2019s speech was intended to more broadly attack Trump\u2019s national security credentials, yet Trump has never made the general statement that POWs are not heroes, even if his McCain-specific comments did insinuate it.
