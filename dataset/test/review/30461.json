But when I removed this uniform and stood at the Delhi border, I became a traitor, a terrorist and a Khalistani. Your Godi media [mainstream media] has used these names while addressing me. I would like to give a suggestion to you, call any CO [commanding officer] of Sikh regiment and check how the morale of the troops has been affected since the farmers\u2019 protest began. They will let you know. If there is unrest back home, no trooper can focus on his duty wholeheartedly\u2026\u201d The video, shared by @India_Resists, was also quote-tweeted by Bollywood actor Swara Bhaskar.
