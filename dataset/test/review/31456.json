["By Robert Farley", "Posted on July 6, 2020", "President Donald Trump misdirected blame when he questioned why NASCAR driver Bubba Wallace had not \u201capologized  to all of those great NASCAR drivers & officials who came to his aid \u2026 only to find out that the whole thing was just another HOAX.\u201d", "Wallace, NASCAR\u2019s only full-time Black driver, was not the one who reported a garage door pull-down rope fashioned like a noose at the Talladega Superspeedway. Nor was he responsible for initiating an investigation into it as a potential hate crime against Wallace \u2014 something the FBI later dismissed.", "Wallace learned about the noose and the subsequent investigation into it during a June 21 conversation with NASCAR\u2019s president, who Wallace said tearfully told him that a \u201chate crime was committed.\u201d", "On July 6, Trump tweeted about that noose incident, as well as NASCAR\u2019s decision to ban Confederate flags at its events, claiming \u2014 wrongly \u2014 that they have \u201ccaused lowest ratings EVER!\u201d", "Has @BubbaWallace apologized to all of those great NASCAR drivers & officials who came to his aid, stood by his side, & were willing to sacrifice everything for him, only to find out that the whole thing was just another HOAX? That & Flag decision has caused lowest ratings EVER!", "\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 6, 2020", "The noose incident came not long after Wallace\u2019s campaign for NASCAR to ban Confederate flags at its events. In a June 8 interview on CNN, Wallace called on NASCAR to ban the flags, and two days later the racing organization announced that \u201cdisplay of the confederate flag will be prohibited from all NASCAR events and properties.\u201d Wallace faced threats for his position.", "Less than two weeks later, on June 21, NASCAR announced the discovery of a noose hanging in Wallace\u2019s garage at Talladega, calling it a \u201cheinous act\u201d and promising an \u201cimmediate investigation.\u201d", "According to a NASCAR timeline, a member of Wallace\u2019s race team \u2014 not Wallace himself \u2014 reported to NASCAR officials on the afternoon of June 21 that he had found a noose in the garage assigned to Wallace. NASCAR security inspected all the garages and determined that the only garage pull ropes fashioned like a noose was the one in Wallace\u2019s garage. Soon after, NASCAR\u2019s senior leadership met and initiated an investigation.", "At around 7:30 p.m. that evening, NASCAR president Steve Phelps notified Wallace about the noose, and later that evening, NASCAR released a statement:", "NASCAR, June 21: Late this afternoon, NASCAR was made aware that a noose was found in the garage stall of the 43 team. We are angry and outraged, and cannot state strongly enough how seriously we take this heinous act. We have launched an immediate investigation, and will do everything we can to identify the person(s) responsible and eliminate them from the sport. As we have stated unequivocally, there is no place for racism in NASCAR, and this act only strengthens our resolve to make the sport open and welcoming to all.", "The following day, NASCAR drivers and others escorted Wallace\u2019s car to the front of the line at the Talladega race track in a show of support for the driver. Wallace shared a video of it on Twitter with the words, \u201cMy family.\u201d", "The day after that, June 23, the FBI closed its investigation, issuing a statement that said \u201cno federal crime was committed.\u201d", "\u201cThe FBI learned that garage number 4, where the noose was found, was assigned to Bubba Wallace last week,\u201d the statement read. \u201cThe investigation also revealed evidence, including authentic video confirmed by NASCAR, that the noose found in garage number 4 was in that garage as early as October 2019. Although the noose is now known to have been in garage number 4 in 2019, nobody could have known Mr. Wallace would be assigned to garage number 4 last week.\u201d", "In a separate statement issued on June 23, NASCAR said, \u201cThe FBI report concludes, and photographic evidence confirms, that the garage door pull rope fashioned like a noose had been positioned there since as early as last fall. This was obviously well before the 43 team\u2019s arrival and garage assignment.\u201d Later, NASCAR released a photo of the noose, shown below.", "On June 23, the day the FBI determined that no hate crime was targeted at Wallace,\u00a0 the race car driver was interviewed on CNN about his role in the unfolding events the day the noose was discovered, including his conversations with NASCAR president Phelps.", "\u201cBut the conversation that I had with Steve Phelps was \u2014 I would say and I\u2019m speaking for him \u2014 I would probably say one of the hardest things, if not the hardest thing he\u2019s ever had to tell somebody,\u201d Wallace said. \u201cTears rolling down his face. Choked up on every word that he was trying to say that the evidence that he had brought to me that a \u2018hate crime was committed,\u2019 quote unquote.\u201d", "\u201cBut I never seen the noose,\u201d Wallace said. \u201cI never reported it.\u201d", "\u201cAnd I\u2019ll shoot it to you straight each and every time,\u201d Wallace said. \u201cBecause that\u2019s how I was brought up and that\u2019s what I stand by. And in my statement on Sunday night, this will not break me. None of the allegations of being a hoax will break me or tear me down. Will it piss me off, absolutely, but that only fuels the competitive drive in me to shut everybody up.\u201d", "In response to Trump\u2019s call for Wallace to apologize, Wallace posted a statement on Twitter that, in part, implored his young fans to \u201calways deal with the hate being thrown at you with LOVE! Love over hate every day. Love should come naturally as people are TAUGHT to hate. Even when it\u2019s HATE from the POTUS.\u201d POTUS is the acronym for president of the United States.", "In a press briefing on July 6, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany fielded several questions from reporters about the president\u2019s tweet.", "One reporter asked why it was Wallace\u2019s responsibility to apologize for an investigation into a noose that he didn\u2019t report, and never saw first-hand.", "\u201cWell, look, the FBI \u2013 as I noted \u2014 concluded that this was not a hate crime and he believes it\u2019d go a long way if Bubba came out and acknowledged that, as well,\u201d McEnany said.", "Wallace has acknowledged that the noose \u201cwasn\u2019t directed to me.\u201d But it was a noose, nonetheless, he said in his interview on CNN.", "\u201cIt was a noose. It was a noose that was whether tied in 2019 or whatever. It was a noose,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it wasn\u2019t directed to me. But somebody tied a noose. That\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. It was \u2014 it is a noose.\u201d", "McEnany also said Trump was \u201cnot making a judgment one way or the other\u201d about NASCAR\u2019s decision to ban the Confederate flag at events.", "\u201cThe intent of the tweet was to stand up for the men and women of NASCAR, and the fans and those who have gone, and this rush of judgment of the media to call something a hate crime when in fact the FBI report concluded this was not an intentional racist act. And it very much mirrors other times when there had been a rush to judgment, let\u2019s say with the Covington boys or with Jussie Smollett,\u201d McEnany said.", "Although McEnany said the tweet was intended, in part to \u201cstand up for the men and women of NASCAR,\u201d NASCAR driver Jimmie Johnson \u2014 a seven-time NASCAR Cup Series champion \u2014 tweeted #IStandWithBubba. NASCAR driver Tyler Reddick tweeted, and then deleted, this: \u201cWe don\u2019t need an apology. We did what was right and we will do just fine without your support.\u201d Reddick then retweeted a post by Fox Sports NASCAR reporter Bob Pockrass, who said \u201cthere is nothing to apologize for.\u201d", "As for the president\u2019s claim that the noose \u201choax\u201d and NASCAR\u2019s decision to ban the Confederate flag \u201chas caused lowest ratings ever!,\u201d NBC News reported that TV ratings for NASCAR events are up.", "NBC News, July 6: Since NASCAR announced a ban on the Confederate flag last month, the sport has seen a boost in television ratings. Overnight ratings following the sport\u2019s June race at Martinsville, Virginia, which immediately followed the banning announcement, were up 104 percent over a comparable 2019 race.", "The Talladega race in Alabama later in June, where the noose incident Trump referred to happened, rated as the most-watched Monday contest in years. NASCAR has also benefited from being one of the few live events on TV, as most other sports remain idled in the U.S. due to the coronavirus pandemic.", "Michael Mulvihill, an executive vice president at Fox Sports, tweeted, \u201cNASCAR viewership on Fox networks is up +8% since returning from its pandemic hiatus on May 17.\u201d", "As for McEnany\u2019s claim that the noose incident \u201cmirrors other times when there had been a rush to judgment.\u201d including with Jussie Smollet, she is referring to the actor who has been indicted for staging a hate crime. Wallace hasn\u2019t been accused of staging anything and, as we said, he didn\u2019t report a hate crime.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
