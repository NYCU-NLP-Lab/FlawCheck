["By Lori Robertson and D'Angelo Gore", "Posted on January 31, 2020", "The campaigns of President Donald Trump and Democrat Mike Bloomberg have purchased airtime during the preeminent TV ad event of the year: the Super Bowl. Both scheduled spots make claims that require context or further explanation.", "Trump\u2019s campaign released one of two ads it has planned for Sunday.", "The released campaign ad begins with an announcer saying, \u201cAmerica demanded change. \u2026 And change is what we got.\u201d It goes on to talk about the economy. But it\u2019s worth noting the economy was doing well before Trump took office, and the continued decline in the unemployment rate is a continuation of a trend \u2014 not a \u201cchange.\u201d", "The ad says, \u201cunemployment rate sinking to a 49-year low.\u201d The December rate \u2014 3.5% \u2014 is the lowest it has been since it hit that mark in December 1969, 50 years ago. The unemployment rate was lower \u2014 3.4% \u2014 over several months in 1968 and 1969 and was at its record low of 2.5% in May and June 1953, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.", "During then-President Barack Obama\u2019s last four years in office, the rate had dropped from 8% in January 2013 to 4.7% in January 2017, the month Trump took office, and it has declined another 1.2 percentage points since. At the time, Janet Yellen, then-chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, and Ben Bernake, a former Fed chair, said the economy already was close to \u201cfull employment.\u201d Since then, the unemployment rate has declined another 1.2 percentage points.", "The Super Bowl ad highlights the unemployment rate for African Americans, saying it \u201cfell to a new low\u201d and the rate of Hispanic Americans, saying it \u201chit an all-time record low.\u201d\u00a0For African Americans, unemployment hit its lowest rate,\u00a05.4%, in August 2019\u00a0and has edged up slightly to 5.9% as of December. For Hispanic Americans, the lowest rate was\u00a03.9% in September 2019, rising a bit to 4.2% in December.", "But, again, as we\u2019ve said before, these rates reflect the continuation of a yearslong slide, beginning in late 2010 or early 2011, as the chart below shows.", "When we wrote about these figures a year ago, experts had noted that the gap between white unemployment and the rates for black and Hispanic Americans had remained about the same under Trump\u2019s presidency. The gap has narrowed a bit since \u2014 even though those racial groups continue to have higher unemployment rates than whites. According to the latest figures from BLS, the percentage point gap in January 2017 was 3.3 points for African Americans and 1.6 points for Hispanic Americans; as of December, those gaps were 2.7 points and 1 point, respectively.", "The ad also says on-screen \u201cbest wage growth in a decade,\u201d and it\u2019s true that year-to-year nominal average hourly earnings\u00a0for all workers and production and nonsupervisory workers\u00a0topped 3% in August 2018 and has remained at nearly 3% or above since, according to BLS. That was the highest 12-month growth rate since it topped 3% in late 2008 and early 2009.", "Experts told us these nominal figures were useful in comparing short time periods.\u00a0But inflation-adjusted average hourly earnings tell a different story: Early in 2019, they hit the highest year-over-year increase since November 2015.", "Over the long-term, as we\u2019ve written, inflation-adjusted wages peaked in the early 1970s, generally declined over the next few decades and started rising again in the mid-1990s. (See our June story \u201cAre Wages Rising or Flat?\u201d for more information.)", "Bloomberg\u2019s 60-second commercial, which his campaign unveiled Thursday, features an emotional Calandrian Simpson Kemp of Houston, Texas, talking about her late son, George Kemp Jr., who was fatally shot during an altercation in 2013.", "As Kemp calls it a \u201cnational crisis\u201d that \u201clives are being lost every day\u201d to guns, a graphic on screen says, \u201c2,900 children die from gun violence every year.\u201d She later asserts that the gun lobby should fear Bloomberg because \u201cMike\u2019s fighting for every child.\u201d", "Bloomberg\u2019s campaign told us the statistic comes from the former New York mayor\u2019s own nonprofit that advocates stricter gun laws, Everytown for Gun Safety. But that organization used different language in a June 2019 fact sheet.", "\u201cAnnually, nearly 2,900 children and teens (ages 0 to 19) are shot and killed, and nearly 15,600 are shot and injured,\u201d the document said. (The emphasis is ours.)", "That doesn\u2019t include Kemp\u2019s son, who was 20 at the time of his death nearly seven years ago. But it does include many 18- and 19-year-olds who also were legally considered adults in most U.S. states \u2014 not \u201cchildren,\u201d as the ad claims.", "When limited to young people ages 0 to 17, the number of firearm-related deaths drops by nearly half to roughly 1,499 per year, according to the most recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System. (That\u2019s the average over the five years from 2013-2017, the same time period used in Everytown for Gun Safety\u2019s calculation.)", "And not all of them were murdered like George Kemp or the young students at a school in Newtown, Connecticut, which could be the impression some get from the two examples used in the ad.", "The majority of those \u2014 792 \u2014 were homicides (which includes legal interventions) while 590, or around 39%, were deaths by suicide. The remainder were either unintentional deaths (88) or deaths in which the intent couldn\u2019t be determined (30).", "It is certainly not our intent to minimize the deaths of those young people older than 17, but the fact is, a lot of them, if not all, were not \u201cchildren\u201d by law.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
