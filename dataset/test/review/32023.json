["By Lori Robertson", "Posted on September 24, 2020", "Continuing a yearslong trend, President Donald Trump made false and misleading comments about new auto plants in Michigan, and the industry at large \u2014\u00a0boasting in recent campaign rallies about accomplishments that aren\u2019t true.", "The number of motor vehicle and parts manufacturing jobs in Michigan has gone down \u2014 not up \u2014 under Trump, even before the coronavirus pandemic caused economic shutdowns.", "In a rally in Fayetteville, North Carolina, on Sept. 19 and another in Vandalia, Ohio, on Sept. 21, Trump told a story about asking Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe (who recently resigned) for Japanese car companies to build plants in the U.S., claiming, \u201cNext day, it was a story, \u2018Five car companies to open up in Michigan.'\u201d", "Here\u2019s the version Trump told at the Sept. 21 rally:", "Vandalia, Ohio, rally Sept. 21: You know how many car plants we\u2019re bringing back to Michigan? Nobody\u2019s ever seen it. For 40 years, they didn\u2019t build a plant. And now they\u2019re building them all over. And I tell countries, I told a great gentleman, he just retired, Prime Minister Abe of Japan. I said, \u201cShinzo, you got to build plants here, you can\u2019t do this. You\u2019re building your cars in Japan and sending them. We want our cars built here. We want cars built here.\u201d He said, \u201cWell, that\u2019s not up to me, that\u2019s up to the company.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s all right, Shinzo, I know you can do it.\u201d The next day they announced five plants, I mean, what can I tell you?", "The president is wrong on two counts: Japanese car companies didn\u2019t announce five new plants in Michigan, and auto plants have indeed been built in the U.S. in the past 40 years.", "Trump also told a crowd in Freeland, Michigan, on Sept. 10 this story about the \u201cfive car companies \u2026 coming to Michigan,\u201d and claimed that \u201cyou haven\u2019t had a plant built in like 42 years.\u201d", "If he meant to refer to only auto manufacturing plants built in Michigan, he\u2019s wrong on that, too. Prior to 2017, when Trump took office, General Motors built a light vehicle assembly plant in Lansing Delta Township, completed in 2006. It\u2019s \u201cGM\u2019s newest plant in the United States,\u201d the company\u2019s website says.", "That\u2019s the most recent light vehicle assembly plant built in the state prior to 2017, when Trump took office, according to Kristin Dziczek, vice president of industry, labor & economics at the Center for Automotive Research.", "CAR is a Michigan-based research group that receives some of its funding from the federal government and tracks auto industry investments in North America.", "In Ohio, Dziczek said, the most recent light vehicle assembly plant was completed in 2005: a Fiat Chrysler Automobiles plant to build the Jeep Wrangler and Wrangler Unlimited in Toledo.", "Trump has made similar claims before, such as when he said in June 2019, naming several states, \u201cThey hadn\u2019t built one [an auto plant] in decades and now they\u2019re all over the place.\u201d Two new plants had been announced in 2015 in South Carolina \u2014 by Volvo, which broke ground on the plant on Sept. 25, 2015, and by Mercedes-Benz, which broke ground in July 2016.", "As for new plants since Trump took office, CAR\u00a0told us then that it knew of only two new assembly plants: a Toyota/Mazda joint venture plant in Alabama (announced\u00a0in January 2018) and a Fiat Chrysler Automobiles plant in Michigan (announced\u00a0in February 2019).", "We asked CAR about Trump\u2019s recent claim regarding five new Japanese plants in Michigan. Dziczek told us there have been five new investments by Japanese automakers in Michigan, but only one of them is a manufacturing facility, which was announced on Jan. 30, 2017, just 10 days after Trump took office.", "And it\u2019s not an auto assembly plant to build cars, as Trump\u2019s comments suggest.", "Honda and General Motors announced the joint venture to produce hydrogen fuel cell systems in GM\u2019s existing Brownstone, Michigan, battery pack manufacturing facility. The companies said in a press release they would invest a combined $85 million in the project, which would create nearly 100 jobs. Honda and GM had been working together to create fuel cell systems under a collaboration agreement they unveiled in July 2013.", "As for the other four investments in Michigan:", "We asked the Trump campaign for support for the president\u2019s statements, but we haven\u2019t received a response.", "Even if Trump meant to say new \u201cinvestments\u201d instead of \u201cplants,\u201d\u00a0the Michigan investments during his time in office\u00a0are less than what Japanese companies had invested in\u00a0the three prior years in\u00a02014 to 2016.", "Dziczek said there were 11 investments by Japanese companies in Michigan over that 2014-2016 time frame in expansions, new facilities and retooling of an existing facility. Those investments totaled $315.3 million and involved more than 2,529 jobs (with no information on jobs for three of the investments).", "During Trump\u2019s tenure, there have been $174.2 million in investments involving 285 jobs (with no information on the investment or jobs for the vehicle charging stations or the autonomous vehicle testing facility).", "While Trump has made false boasts about auto plants in Michigan, the number of jobs in vehicles and parts manufacturing in the state has dropped under his watch. As of February, before the pandemic shutdowns began, motor vehicle and parts manufacturing jobs had fallen by 2,400 from January 2017, when Trump took office, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.", "As of August, those Michigan jobs stood at 155,800, down 18,400 from the month Trump was inaugurated.", "Nationwide, motor vehicles and parts manufacturing jobs have gone up under Trump, but the job growth was faster under the Obama administration. That\u2019s looking at the pre-pandemic numbers. From January 2017 to February 2020, 49,300 auto manufacturing jobs were added, a 5.2% growth rate. During the same time period \u2014 37 months \u2014 at the end of the Obama administration, motor vehicles and parts manufacturing jobs grew by 99,600, or 11.6%.", "The president also claimed that auto sales and manufacturing were setting records, but neither is at record levels.", "Trump, Sept. 21: Car manufacturing is record setting. You take a look at car sales are record setting.", "Data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis show that neither domestic production nor light weight vehicle sales are at record levels. The latest figures are for July and August, respectively.", "On a yearly basis, both production and sales have been lower under Trump\u2019s presidency than they were in 2016, the year before he took office.", "In 2016, 3.9 million units were assembled in the U.S. That figure has dropped every year since and stood at 2.5 million units in 2019.", "As for sales, those too were higher in 2016 \u2014 209.6 million units \u2014 than any year so far under Trump. Light vehicle sales were 203.4 million in 2019.", "Dziczek shared with us figures that include sales of medium duty vehicles. Those also showed 2016 with higher sales than any year since.", "It\u2019s possible Trump was referring to the pace of recovery for manufacturing and sales, after both plummeted in March and April during economic shutdowns due to the coronavirus pandemic. Both measures have nearly recovered to February levels. But if that\u2019s a record recovery, it was only possible after production fell by 99.2% from February to April and light vehicle sales dropped 47.8%.", "Eugene Kiely contributed to this article.", "Editor\u2019s note:\u00a0Swing State Watch\u00a0is an occasional series about false and misleading political messages in key states that will help decide the 2020 presidential election.", "Editor\u2019s Note: Please consider a donation to FactCheck.org.
