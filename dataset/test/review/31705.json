(Ian Thomas Jansen-Lonnquist/The New York Times)", "Donald Trump says his plan to roll back birthright citizenship for children of illegal immigrants will pass constitutional muster because \"many of the great scholars say that anchor babies are not covered.\"", "\"Many of the great scholars\" -- really? That comment caught our attention.", "In case you need a refresher on birthright citizenship: As it stands now, any person born on U.S. soil is a citizen -- regardless of the parents\u2019 immigration status -- because of the citizenship clause of the 14th Amendment. Trump has recently advocated for pulling back citizenship for illegal immigrants\u2019 children. Some, like Trump, refer to these children as \"anchor babies.\"", "\"The parents have to come in legally,\" Trump said, talking to reporters in New Hampshire Aug. 19. \"Now we\u2019re going to have to find out what\u2019s going to happen from a court standpoint. But many people, many of the great scholars say that anchor babies are not covered (by the 14th Amendment). We\u2019re going to have to find out.\"", "Considering that about 300,000 babies are born to illegal immigrants and become citizens every year, we wondered if Trump is right to say that \"many\" scholars think this isn\u2019t necessarily a constitutional right.", "We won\u2019t dig into who\u2019s a \"great\" scholar, but we will look at how widespread this position is and if \"many\" say the 14th Amendment isn\u2019t an impediment to Trump\u2019s plan.", "Differing interpretations", "The 14th Amendment became part of the Constitution in 1868 following the Civil War. The amendment established birthright citizenship and equal protection under the law for all citizens, making newly freed slaves full American citizens.", "The relevant clause reads: \"All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.\"", "Today, this clause is widely understood to mean that the Constitution requires that everyone born on U.S. soil -- regardless of parents\u2019 citizenship -- is automatically an American citizen. We polled a number of experts in immigration law, and each one told us that this is the mainstream view among legal scholars, without question.", "The matter is not considered 100 percent settled, though. For one, the clause doesn\u2019t directly address illegal immigration. Also, the Supreme Court has never made a specific ruling about a person born to undocumented parents.", "The most relevant Supreme Court ruling was in an 1898 case, United States vs. Wong Kim Ark. The court decided that a man, Wong Kim Ark, was an American citizen because he was born in America, even though his parents were Chinese immigrants. Because his parents were legal residents, the case does not directly apply to children of undocumented parents.", "To Trump\u2019s point, there are some scholars who argue the 14th Amendment allows birthright citizenship for illegal immigrants but does not require it. This is a subtle but important point, because if the Constitution does not require birthright citizenship, Congress might be able to change the law without having to pass a Constitutional amendment, an arduous process.", "In any case, this viewpoint is held by only a handful of legal scholars, not \"many.\"", "\"I believe that Trump\u2019s statement is incorrect,\" said Yale Law School professor Peter Schuck, one of the leading scholars who has endorsed this position. \"I would say that our view on the constitutional issue is decidedly the minority view.\"", "The gist of the argument rests on the fact that the 14th Amendment requires people to be born on U.S. soil and be \"subject to the jurisdiction thereof\" to receive citizenship at birth, as the amendment says. To understand this point a little better, consider the example of children of foreign diplomats born in the United States. These children are not citizens because their parents have allegiance to a foreign country and not the United States -- meaning they are not subject to U.S. jurisdiction.", "Some people interpret the inclusion of \"jurisdiction\" as requiring mutual consent for citizenship: The person and the United States have to agree that this person is eligible for citizenship. If the parent is here illegally, does the United States agree that the child should be eligible for citizenship? Congress could, according to this point of view, decide that the answer to this question is \"no,\" rendering the 14th Amendment inapplicable to these children, without violating the Constitution.", "We won\u2019t dig into this question further -- there\u2019s a lot of history and judicial precedent to digest on both sides of the argument. (If you want to read more, we recommend this 2010 Congressional Research Report.)", "The small group of scholars who endorse this idea -- that Congress can decide whether birthright citizenship extends to children of undocumented immigrants -- is not strictly partisan. Schuck is a self-described moderate, and he published the primary book on this topic in the 1980s with University of Pennsylvania professor Rogers Smith, who is liberal. Many of the scholars who have come out in support of this view in the past few weeks have conservative backgrounds, such as Edward Erler and John Eastman, both of the conservative Claremont Institute think tank. But not all conservatives share this point of view, either.", "Also, at least one federal judge has said publicly that interpreting the 14th Amendment in this way wouldn\u2019t require changing the Constitution: Hon. Richard Posner of the 7th Circuit, appointed by President Ronald Reagan.", "Still, these legal thinkers \"are in a very small minority,\" said Evelyn Cruz, director of the Immigration Law and Policy Clinic at Arizona State University\u2019s law school. \"Most scholars believe that the Constitution would need to be amended to achieve a reading opposite to Wong Kim Ark.\"", "Our ruling", "Trump said, \"Many of the great scholars say that anchor babies are not covered\" by the 14th Amendment.", "There are respected\u00a0academics who argue that the 14th Amendment allows but does not require children of illegal immigrants to receive citizenship just by virtue of having been born on American soil. However, this is a minority of immigration and constitutional law scholars, far outweighed by those who believe the 14th Amendment requires birthright citizenship for children of illegal immigrants.", "Trump goes too far when he says \"many,\" so we rate his claim Half True.", "NBC, \"Politics Nation\" transcript, Aug. 19, 2015", "Congressional Research Service, \"Birthright Citizenship Under the 14th Amendment of Persons Born in the United States to Alien Parents,\" Aug. 12, 2010", "National Review, \"Trump\u2019s Critics Are Wrong about the 14th Amendment and Birthright Citizenship,\" Aug. 19, 2015", "National Review, \"We Can Apply the 14th Amendment While Also Reforming Birthright Citizenship Read,\" Aug. 24, 2015", "National Review, \"On Citizenship, the \u2018Birthers\u2019 Are Right,\" Aug. 22, 2015", "Center for Immigration Studies, \"Birthright Citizenship in the United States: A Global Comparison,\" August 2010", "New York Times, \"Birthright of a Nation,\" Aug. 13, 2010", "Los Angeles Times, \"The complicated rules of citizenship,\" Nov. 21, 2014", "Journal of Constitutional Law, \"Birthright Citizenship and the 14th Amendment in 1868 and 2008,\" July 2009", "The Atlantic, \"Could Birthright Citizenship Be Undone?\" Aug. 19, 2015", "The Becker-Posner Blog, \"The Controversy over Birthright Citizenship,\" Oct. 17, 2010", "NPR, \"3 Things You Should Know About Birthright Citizenship,\" Aug. 18, 2015", "National Constitution Center, \"Birthright citizenship looming as a campaign, and constitutional issue,\" Aug. 14, 2015", "The Social Contract, \"Citizenship Without Consent,\" Fall 1996", "Email interview, Judy London, directing attorney at Public Counsel's Immigrants' Rights Project, Aug. 24, 2015", "Email interview, Harvard law professor Gerald Neuman, Aug. 24, 2015", "Email interview, Ben Winograd, Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center staff attorney, Aug. 24, 2015", "Email interview, Evelyn Cruz, director of the Immigration Law and Policy Clinic at ASU, Aug. 24, 2015", "Email interview, Niels Frenzen, director of the Immigration Clinic at the University of Southern California, Aug. 24, 2015", "Email interview, Yale professor Peter Schuck, Aug. 24, 2015", "Email interview, UPenn professor Rogers Smith, Aug. 24, 2015", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
