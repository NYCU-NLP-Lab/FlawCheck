["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "Paul Ryan told a boisterous CPAC crowd that without action on the budget, \"the debt will weigh down our country like an anchor.\"\n\nRyan, the Wisconsin congressman and former Republican vice presidential candidate, rose to prominence for budget proposals that dramatically cut spending and made structural changes to Medicare to achieve more savings. This week, Ryan released the 2014 version, which follows much the same blueprint -- and makes the same dire warnings about the nation\u2019s debt.\n\n\"Our debt is already bigger than our economy,\" he said at CPAC on March 15, 2013.\n\nOur colleagues at PolitiFact Texas checked out a similar claim from Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. Here, we\u2019ll take a fresh look.\n\nGDP vs. which kind of debt?\n\nRyan\u2019s office pointed us to two sources of government figures. First, the easy one.\n\nThe Bureau of Economic Analysis\u2019 put out a press release on February 28, 2013 putting GDP at just over $15.8 trillion. The government defines the GDP -- gross domestic product -- as the market value of the goods and services produced by labor and property within the country.\n\nAs for the debt, the U.S. Treasury is the go-to source. As of March 14, 2013, total outstanding public debt is $16,708,225,460,175.14. (We\u2019ll call it $16.7 trillion for everyone\u2019s sanity.) That\u2019s broken down into two categories: debt held by the public and intragovernmental holdings.\n\nHere are those dollar figures:\n\nDebt held by the public: $11.9 trillion\n\nIntragovernmental holdings: $4.8 trillion\n\nTo explain the difference, we\u2019ll borrow from our PolitiFact Texas colleagues\u2019 handiwork.\n\nIntragovernmental debt refers to money owed by agencies within government to other agencies -- basically an internal accounting issue. An example: Social Security surpluses that the government uses for other federal operations. Such money will have to be repaid, it\u2019s presumed, but the demand is less pressing right now and it doesn\u2019t affect credit markets.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nIn contrast, public debt reflects money borrowed from outside sources -- giving it more of a connection to the economy, Josh Gordon, an analyst with the anti-deficit Concord Coalition, told PolitiFact Texas. \"If your problem with the national debt is that you think it\u2019s affecting the economy or interest rates or something like that, the only part of the national debt that affects the economy is the debt held by the public. That\u2019s where the (U.S.) Treasury is borrowing money on the open market.\"\n\nPaul Van de Water, an economist with the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, further explained why that matters.\n\n\"Debt held by the public is important because it reflects the extent to which the government goes\ninto private credit markets to borrow. Such borrowing draws on private national saving and\ninternational saving and therefore competes with investment in the nongovernmental sector (for\nfactories and equipment, research and development, housing, and so forth). Large increases in such borrowing can also push up interest rates and increase the future interest payments the federal government must make to foreign lenders, which reduces Americans\u2019 income. Achieving a stable debt-to-GDP ratio is a key test of fiscal sustainability,\" Van de Water wrote in a memo.\n\nSo, if we just consider debt held by the public -- which is what most affects the economy -- it totals about 75 percent of GDP -- not, as Ryan said, more than the size of the economy.\n\nBut Ryan isn\u2019t entirely off-base, especially since partisans tend to disagree about the importance of intragovernmental holdings.\n\n\"When you dig a bit deeper, you hit a partisan debate about the portion of the debt not held by the public, most of which is held by the government in trust funds. Republicans say that the trust funds are filled with IOUs, which eventually will have to be redeemed with other funds. Democrats say that the trust funds represent binding promises that government has made to tens of millions of Americans. They\u2019re both right,\" said William Galston, an expert with the Brookings Institution who was an adviser to President Bill Clinton. \"What Ryan said is not untrue, although it\u2019s not the only way of describing the truth.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nRyan claimed that \"our debt is already bigger than our economy.\"\n\nIf you count debt held by the public and intragovernmental holdings, the debt is roughly 105 percent of the economy. But counting only debt held by the public, which is what many economists say affects the wider economy and credit markets, the debt is only 75 percent of \u00a0GDP.\n\nDebt held by the public is more relevant to discussions about federal spending, but it\u2019s not the one Ryan cited.
