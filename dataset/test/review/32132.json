There is currently no Food and Drug Administration-approved treatment for COVID-19.", "We\u2019ve previously reported on alleged financial ties between the Trump administration and hydroxychloroquine manufacturers, so we wanted to look into this claim, too.", "Trump does have a small financial stake in a French company that makes hydroxychloroquine. But the implication of the post, that Trump could stand to profit from that stake, is misleading.", "The New York Times reported on April 6 that the president has a personal financial interest in Sanofi, a French company that makes hydroxychloroquine, through a mutual fund from a firm called Dodge & Cox. At 3.3%, Sanofi is the largest holding of the firm\u2019s International Stock Fund.", "But Trump\u2019s stake in that fund is rather small.", "The president\u2019s latest financial disclosure form indicates that he holds shares in the mutual fund through three different family trusts.

That would mean the value of Trump\u2019s shares in Sanofi has increased by nearly $260.", "Given the president\u2019s net worth, which Bloomberg estimates to be nearly $3 billion, $260 would be a comparatively small payoff for promoting the use of hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19.
