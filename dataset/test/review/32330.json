["The false claim has notably spread via various Facebook posts in Africa, including this post from Ghanian radio station Joy 99.7 FM which has been shared more than 1,000 times. We\u2019ve archived the post here.", "\"The overjoyed pair said they did it for the \u2018millions of Americans who have consensual incestuous relationships and who are living in fear\u2019 and blasted the Government for wasting taxpayers\u2019 money fighting their challenge,\" reads the caption on the Facebook post.", "It included a link to an article on a website called \u201cMy Joy Online\u201d about a brother and sister, James and Victoria Banes, who \u201chave won the right to marry after a landmark ruling by the Supreme Court of the United States\u201d. That article, archived here, has been shared more than 3,000 times on Facebook via various accounts, according to data from social media analysis tool CrowdTangle.", "A screenshot of an Instagram post carrying the same story has also been circulating on Facebook.", "While we\u2019ve as yet been unable to confirm the original source of the false story, another version appears on a satirical website that uses the tagline \u2018MOST SAVAGE NAME IN SATIRE NEWS\u2019. This version has been shared more than 16,000 times, according to CrowdTangle data. The story also appeared on World News Daily Report, another \u201csatirical\u201d website which has been the source of various viral claims fact-checked by AFP.", "The pictures show a British couple who are not related", "A reverse image search led us to various news articles from 2018 reporting on the legal victory of Charles Keidan and Rebecca Steinfeld, a British couple who have been campaigning for the right to celebrate their relationship with a civil partnership rather than a marriage. You can see the photos on Britain\u2019s Mail Online website, for example, and one of them here on the CNN site.", "Britain introduced civil partnerships for same-sex couples in 2004. Gay marriage was legalised in Britain a decade later, but civil partnerships remained available for same-sex couples.", "Keidan and Steinfeld argued that heterosexual couples should also be able to choose between a marriage and a civil partnership. They argued that marriage had \u201ctreated women as property for centuries\u201d and that a civil partnership was, for them, preferable. As detailed on the Equal Civil Partnerships campaign website, Keidan and Steinfeld launched a legal case over the issue in late 2014 which eventually ended up in the UK Supreme Court in 2018.", "While the Supreme Court agreed with the couple that they should be able to choose between the two types of union just like gay couples, UK law currently remains unchanged. The Guardian newspaper reported in July that ministers are still considering how to expand civil partnerships following the court case.", "Keidan told AFP that he and his partner Steinfeld were still not married.", "\u201cWe are an unmarried and un-related different-sex couple in the UK seeking a civil partnership,\u201d he said in an email. He went on to dismiss the fake posts about incest in the United States, saying: \u201cThis is all completely wrong and/or referring to another case while using photos of us.\u201d", "Siblings cannot marry in the United States", "The term \u201cincest\u201d generally refers to sexual relations between close family members, and American laws on this issue vary between jurisdictions within the country. Many states outlaw sexual relationships between siblings and between parents and their children, and no state allows siblings to marry. In some states, such as Oklahoma, such relations are punishable with prison sentences. In New Jersey and Rhode Island, it is not a criminal offence for two siblings to have a consensual sexual relationship, but they would still not be allowed to marry.", "As for the supposed Supreme Court ruling in favour of a brother and sister called James and Victoria Banes, it never took place. A search of the US Supreme Court website returned no results about a case involving a \u201cJames Banes\u201d or \u201cVictoria Banes\u201d.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
