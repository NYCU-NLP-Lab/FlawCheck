But Cooper vetoed it just days later, saying it didn\u2019t do enough for education and health care.", "The state House voted to override Cooper\u2019s veto on Sept. 11, but the Senate hasn\u2019t been able to wrangle the votes.", "Now, the North Carolina Republican Party is saying Cooper\u2019s budget veto significantly affected his approval ratings.

Cooper) has seen his approval rating plummet after refusing to give teachers their raises or increasing ed funding while holding the state hostage over expanding Obamacare,\" the NC GOP tweeted on Feb. 25.", "The tweet includes misleading information about the governor\u2019s stance on education and why he vetoed the budget. But, since we\u2019ve previously addressed a claim about the reasoning behind Cooper\u2019s veto, we\u2019re going to focus on his approval ratings.", "Is it true that they have plummeted?", "PolitiFact and WRAL reviewed multiple polls conducted before and after Cooper vetoed the budget on June 28.", "The word plummet means to \"drop sharply and abruptly,\" or \"drop straight down at a high rate of speed.\" Most polls show a very slight dip, if any at all.", "Experts who spoke with PolitiFact said use of the word \"plummet\" in this case exaggerates what poll numbers show about Cooper, who they say is generally in good shape for an incumbent facing re-election.", "When we reached out to the NC GOP, its digital director Sasha Duncan pointed us to polling from Civitas Institute, a conservative think tank in North Carolina.
