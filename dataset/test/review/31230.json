["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "Republican U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio says that U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy \"has trouble with the truth.\"", "In a TV ad, Rubio said that his Democratic opponent misled voters about his work experience and educational background.", "The ad includes a clip of a WPTV news anchor Michael Williams on May 23 saying: \"Murphy embellished, according to reports, his University of Miami academic achievement.\"", "Rubio\u2019s ad -- the first during the general election -- makes several other claims about Murphy\u2019s resume and record in Congress which we have previously fact-checked -- and we will explain those in more details later. Here we will focus on whether Murphy embellished his college record.", "Murphy\u2019s college degree", "The ad is largely based on findings by the Miami Herald/Tampa Bay Times on May 23 about how Murphy had characterized his educational background.", "The Herald/Times reported that Murphy's congressional office and Senate campaign websites claimed he graduated with \"degrees in accounting and finance\" from the University of Miami.", "But in reality, he had a single degree based on two areas of study. In 2006, Murphy graduated with a bachelor\u2019s in business administration, with his major areas of study being accounting and finance.", "Murphy\u2019s campaign spokeswoman, Galia Slayen, told the Herald/Times in May that the embellishments were unintentional. After the Herald/Times pointed it out to the Murphy campaign, it \u00a0changed the language to reflect a single degree on both websites.", "But this wasn\u2019t the first time he had claimed dual degrees, the Herald/Times found.", "On his campaign website during his first U.S. House race in 2012, Murphy claimed \"earning dual bachelor\u2019s degrees.\"", "In January 2013 as he started his first term, Murphy told Port St. Lucie local access TV, \"I got a dual degree, actually, in finance and accounting.\"", "After he won his Treasure Coast seat, Murphy\u2019s House and re-election campaign biographies cited a single bachelor\u2019s degree.", "Then the claims about \"dual degrees\" surfaced when he announced his U.S. Senate campaign in 2015.", "For example, on March 24, 2015, his House website\u00a0stated: \"He earned his B.S. in business administration from the University of Miami, graduating with dual degrees in accounting and finance.\"", "A University of Miami spokeswoman, Megan M. Ondrizek, told PolitiFact Florida that Murphy earned a bachelor of business administration in 2006.", "\"He had double majors\u2014one in Finance and one in Accounting,\" she said. \"It is a single degree with a double major. A double major completes the requirements for one degree but two majors.\"", "Alexandra Bassil told the Herald/Times in May that although the university offers separate degrees in accounting and finance, students \"are not permitted to pursue dual degrees in those two subjects.\"", "\"Often, students who double-major make the mistake of saying they have two degrees,\" Bassil said.", "Murphy\u2019s campaign spokesman Joshua Karp told PolitiFact Florida that the website language was \"an innocent mistake.\"", "\"Previous versions of the biography were accurate,\" Karp said. \"Of course Patrick has a dual major in finance and accounting. The ad doesn\u2019t provide the context: this was fixed and we owned up to it.\"", "Other claims in Rubio\u2019s ad", "Rubio\u2019s ad also includes clips from a CBS4 Miami report that \"Murphy has never been a licensed CPA in Florida\" and that \"Murphy was not a small business owner.\"", "That is similar to attacks made in a TV ad by the National Republican Senatorial Committee that Murphy \"never worked as a CPA\" and was \"never a small business owner.\" Although Murphy has oversold his resume, it\u2019s an exaggeration to say he \"never\" worked in those capacities so we rated that claim Mostly False.", "But Rubio\u2019s wording about Murphy\u2019s CPA record is slightly different because he refers to where he got his license. Murphy obtained his CPA license from Colorado while working at Deloitte and Touche in Florida. That means Murphy could still work on audits but couldn\u2019t sign them since he didn\u2019t have a Florida license.", "Rubio\u2019s ad also says, \"No wonder a non-partisan study ranked Murphy one of the least effective members of Congress.\" An American Future Fund ad said that\u00a0\"Murphy was named one of America's least effective congressmen,\" which we rated Mostly False, because it was based on a much-criticized analysis. (The ad cites a Tampa Bay Times blog about a ranking by InsideGov in 2015.)", "Our ruling", "Rubio\u2019s TV ad says, \"Murphy embellished, according to reports, his University of Miami academic achievement.\"", "Murphy has described his University of Miami record in conflicting ways in recent years. On his congressional office and U.S. Senate campaign websites he said he had \"dual degrees\" when in fact he had a single degree with a double major in two areas of study: accounting and finance. When the Herald/Times pointed out the inaccuracy, his campaign said it was an error and fixed it. Murphy had also referred to \"dual degree\" at times in the past while other times his websites reflected a single degree.", "We rate this claim Mostly True.", "Political Ad Archive, U.S. Sen.
