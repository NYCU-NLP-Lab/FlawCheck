["By D'Angelo Gore", "Posted on February 12, 2020", "President Donald Trump defended removing Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman from the White House\u2019s National Security Council by claiming that Vindman\u2019s \u201csuperior \u2026 publicly stated that Vindman had problems with judgement, adhering to the chain of command and leaking information.\u201d But the latter claim leaves a false impression, and the others omit important context.", "Trump is referring to Timothy Morrison, who was the NSC\u2019s senior director for Russia and Europe, and Vindman\u2019s direct supervisor for a little more than three months in 2019, from mid-July through the end of October.", "Here is a summary of what Morrison did and didn\u2019t say about Vindman, who, like Morrison, listened in on Trump\u2019s July 25 call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky and testified in the House impeachment inquiry:", "Trump tweeted about Vindman on Feb. 8, one day after Trump removed him from his position as the NSC\u2019s director for European affairs. Vindman was originally scheduled to leave his post at the White the House in July, when his detail was set to end.", "His early dismissal was described by several congressional Democrats as a form of retaliation for agreeing to be a witness in the House\u2019s impeachment proceedings. Vindman testified that he felt it was \u201cimproper for the president of the United States to demand a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen and a political opponent,\u201d a reference to Trump asking Zelensky to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.", "National Security Adviser Robert O\u2019Brien, at an event for the Atlantic Council on Feb. 11, denied that the decision to remove Vindman was a retaliatory move. \u201cI can absolutely tell you they were not retaliated against,\u201d O\u2019Brien said, referring to Vindman and his twin brother, Lt. Col. Yevgeny Vindman, who was not an impeachment witness but was also removed from his post as an NSC lawyer and ethics official.", "Both men have been reassigned to the Department of the Army, an Army spokeswoman said in a statement to multiple news outlets.", "In his Twitter post, Trump also claimed that Vindman \u201cwas very insubordinate,\u201d \u201creported contents of my \u2018perfect\u2019 calls incorrectly,\u201d and \u201cwas given a horrendous report by his superior.\u201d \u201cIn other words, \u2018OUT,'\u201d Trump wrote.", "\u2026.was given a horrendous report by his superior, the man he reported to, who publicly stated that Vindman had problems with judgement, adhering to the chain of command and leaking information. In other words, \u201cOUT\u201d.", "\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 8, 2020", "An attorney for Vindman released a statement calling the president\u2019s statements \u201cobviously false.\u201d", "It\u2019s not true that Morrison said Vindman \u201chad problems with \u2026 leaking information,\u201d as Trump wrote.", "In his closed-door deposition on Oct. 31, Morrison actually answered \u201cno\u201d when Republican counsel Steve Castor asked him if he ever had \u201cany concerns\u201d that Vindman \u201cmight leak something.\u201d Morrison told Castor that others had told him that they believed Vindman may have leaked information, but Morrison was advised by his lawyer not to elaborate further.", "Then, during a public impeachment hearing on Nov. 19, Morrison said he \u201cdidn\u2019t believe or disbelieve\u201d what he was told about Vindman possibly being the source of White House leaks.", "On CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d on Feb. 9, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham also suggested that Vindman may have leaked information to the anonymous whistleblower who last August filed a complaint about Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky with the inspector general of the intelligence community.", "\u201cHe\u2019s never been asked questions, \u2018did you leak to the whistleblower?\u2019\u201d Graham said.", "Vindman may have never been asked that question, but Vindman has denied divulging information to anyone who was not authorized to have it.", "\u201cI never did, never would,\u201d Vindman responded when he was asked during his November public testimony if he ever leaked anything. \u201cThat is preposterous that I would do that.\u201d", "Vindman said that he gave a readout of Trump\u2019s July 25 call with Zelensky to only two people outside of the NSC, and both, he said, were \u201ccleared U.S. government officials\u201d with a \u201cneed to know\u201d: George Kent, deputy assistant secretary for European and Eurasian affairs in the State Department; and another person who worked within the intelligence community, whom Vindman\u2019s attorney advised him not to name.", "Vindman also has denied knowing the identity of the whistleblower.", "It\u2019s true that Morrison said in his October deposition that he \u201chad concerns\u201d about Vindman\u2019s \u201cjudgment.\u201d He later explained that meant Vindman \u201cdid not always exercise the best judgment in terms of the policymaking process and \u2014 the policy process.\u201d He also said he \u201chad concerns\u201d that Vindman \u201cdid not exercise appropriate judgment as to whom he would say what.\u201d", "In addition, Morrison said that Hill and others told him they had concerns about Vindman\u2019s judgment, too.", "But in her public testimony, Hill clarified that her primary concern was that Vindman, because of his military background, might not be suited for a position that was becoming increasingly political.", "\u201cCol. Vindman is a highly distinguished, decorated military officer \u2026 and we were evaluating and looking at him in the context of what his future positions would be in the context of the U.S. Army,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I was concerned that if, for example, Col. Vindman might decide to leave the military, that perhaps he wasn\u2019t as well suited for something that would be much more political. I did not feel that he had the political antenna to deal with something that was straying into domestic politics. Not everyone is suited for that.\u201d", "But, she added: \u201cThat does not mean in any way that I was questioning his overall judgment nor was I questioning in any way his substantive expertise. \u2026 This was a very specific issue because by June, we saw that things were diverging and he needed a completely different sensitivity.\u201d", "And in his public testimony on Nov. 19, Vindman quoted from Hill\u2019s final performance review of him, which he said reads, in part: \u201cAlex is a top 1 percent military officer and the best Army officer I have worked with in my 15 years of government service. He is brilliant, unflappable and exercises excellent judgment.\u201d", "It\u2019s also true that Morrison said that Vindman did not follow the chain of command when Vindman reported his concerns about Trump\u2019s July 25 call with Zelensky to lawyers at the NSC instead of Morrison. Morrison said he would have preferred that Vindman came to him first, but it was not unusual for him not to do so because of the way things worked under Hill, who was Vindman\u2019s supervisor before Morrison.", "Morrison had only been Vindman\u2019s supervisor for a little more than a week at the time the call between the presidents took place.", "\u201cMy predecessor had a different style for managing her staff than I do,\u201d Morrison said during his private testimony in October. \u201cShe did not have the same view of how reporting through the chain of command should work.\u201d", "Vindman testified that he went to NSC lead counsel John Eisenberg first because Eisenberg previously told Vindman that he could come to him with such concerns. Vindman said he earlier had reported concerns about topics discussed during a July 10 meeting with Gordon Sondland, the former U.S. ambassador to the European Union, to the NSC legal team.\u00a0It was at that point, Vindman said, when Eisenberg told him that he could come to Eisenberg with similar concerns in the future.", "When he was asked in his November public hearing why he didn\u2019t go directly to Morrison, Vindman said he tried to but didn\u2019t get a chance to talk to Morrison before Eisenberg advised him not to talk to anyone else about the Trump-Zelensky call.", "\u201cI went immediately .. per the instructions from the July 10 incident \u2026 to Mr. Eisenberg,\u201d Vindman said. \u201cI attempted to try to talk to Mr. Morrison. That didn\u2019t happen before I received instructions from John Eisenberg to not talk to anybody else any further.\u201d", "The White House did not respond when we asked what Trump meant when he tweeted that Vindman \u201creported contents of my \u2018perfect\u2019 calls incorrectly.\u201d", "It\u2019s possible Trump was referring to the fact that Vindman went to Eisenberg instead of Morrison with his concerns. The president may have also been referring to a discrepancy about what the White House said Trump and Zelensky discussed in their first phone conversation on April 21, 2019, when Trump called to congratulate Zelensky on winning Ukraine\u2019s presidential election that day.", "The White House originally released a statement about the congratulatory call that said Trump mentioned working with Zelensky to \u201croot out corruption\u201d in Ukraine. But a memo of the call that the White House released months later showed that Trump never brought up corruption. At the time, a White House spokesman said Vindman, who was the NSC\u2019s top expert on Ukraine, prepared the readout of the call and was responsible for the error.", "Vindman testified that the statement about the call put out by the White House was \u201cnot entirely accurate\u201d because Trump did not mention corruption, which had been included in the talking points that Vindman prepared in advance for Trump to use in the call.", "But to be clear, we are not aware of any evidence that Vindman relayed false information to anyone about what Trump and Zelensky discussed during their July 25 conversation.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
