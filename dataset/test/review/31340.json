You can see parts of the original footage (as well as the edited counterparts) in the clip below:", "The \"GhostCrash\" video does not document\u00a0a series of paranormal car crashes. It is a work of creative\u00a0digital editing concocted by Italian graphic artist\u00a0Donato Sansone, who originally shared it to his Vimeo page in May 2018.", "Feedy TV. \u00a0 \"Bizzare and Unexplainable: 8 Car Accidents that were Recorded by CCTV.\" \u00a0 \u00a0 6 July 2018.", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
