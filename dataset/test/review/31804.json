["About this rating", "Memes\u00a0claiming that former President Ronald Reagan continued his golf vacation after nearly\u00a0300 people were killed in an attack in Beirut in 1983 are frequently circulated\u00a0on Facebook:", "The above-displayed memes have been circulating for several years, but they regained popularity in March 2016 as President Obama was criticized for remaining in Cuba (where he was making a state visit) after 31 people were killed during terrorist bombings in Brussels, Belgium.", "While these images correctly reflect that Ronald Reagan was on vacation when a suicide bomber crashed a truck full of explosives into an airport building that was being used as barracks for U.S. Marines in Beirut, Lebanon, on 23 October 1983 (killing 241 American servicemen), the former president did not continue his golf vacation after receiving the news.\u00a0The first image showing Reagan on the golf course was taken the day before the bombing, not the day after:", "President Reagan playing golf at the Augusta National Golf Club. 10/22/83.", "An article published by the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0the day after the attack also noted that Reagan cut his vacation short to return to the White House:", "\"There are no words that can express our sorrow and grief over the loss of those splendid young men and the injury to so many others,'' the President said gravely this morning, standing in the rain outside the White House after a hurried return from a golfing weekend in Augusta, Ga.", "The second photo displayed above\u00a0was also taken the day before the Beirut bombings:", "President Ronald Reagan, clad in pajamas and bathrobe, talking on telephone to Robert McFarlane and Secretary of State George Shultz, re urgent request from five members of Eastern Carribbean States on the situation in Grenada.", "However, the former president wasn't always necessarily quick\u00a0to react after deadly\u00a0international incidents. After a Korean airliner was shot down by the Soviet Union on 1 September 1983, President Reagan remained at his ranch in Santa Barbara:", "At this point, (White House spokesman Larry Speakes) Speakes was interrupted and asked if Reagan was going back to Washington. He ignored the question and read a statement on the Middle East. Asked again if Reagan was going back to Washington, Speakes answered, \"There are no plans for the president to return to Washington earlier than anticipated.\"", "Speakes walked away from the podium and then came back to take questions. He announced, as he does every day in California, what Reagan intended to do that day: \"The president, as usual, is planning at horseback ride this morning and will generally work around the ranch in the afternoon. The weather there is as it is here, sunny and warm.\"", "These\u00a0memes are based on an assumption that a U.S. president has to react immediately to breaking news of a violent incident or crisis by returning to the nation's capital, even when such an action does not facilitate the handling of the situation. \u00a0When President Obama was criticized in 2014 for his reaction to\u00a0Malaysian Airlines Flight 17 being shot down (reportedly by pro-Russian insurgents), reporter Chris\u00a0Wallace noted that sometimes, \"the best thing presidents can do is nothing\":", "I know there's like an immediate reaction, that you want to say he should have run back to Washington and gone back to the Situation Room. I know that a lot of folks at Fox here are saying that. As somebody who covered the White House and saw for six years Ronald Reagan in various situations, sometimes the best thing presidents can do is nothing, to continue on. If he had gone back to Washington and gone to the situation room \u2014 first of all, there's not much he can do, we're not in control of the situation. And it would have dialed it up.", "I was covering Ronald Reagan at that time [i.e., when the Korean airliner was shot down].\u00a0He was in Santa Barbara at his ranch when that happened, and quite frankly he didn't want to leave. And his advisers realized how terrible this looked, and eventually persuaded him he had to fly back to Washington and had to give this speech to the nation, but it did take him four days.", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
