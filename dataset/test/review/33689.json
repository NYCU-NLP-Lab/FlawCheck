["About this rating", "An alleged design feature built into the bottom of plastic bottles of Gatorade brand sports drinks, one which had supposedly been hiding in plain sight for years, was seemingly revealed in August 2018 when a photograph showing a bright orange cap safely secured in an indentation on the bottom of a Gatorade bottle was posted online:", "It's unclear who was originally responsible for this image.

We also examined various patents covering the design of the Gatorade bottle and found no mention of an underside lid holder.
