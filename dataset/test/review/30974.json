Now, as it stands, our health care system has adequate ventilators, ICU beds, medical professionals and ultimately, like I said, we must prepare for the worst, pray for the best.\"", "That contradicts the warnings of public health experts, who have been sounding alarm about the shortage of ventilators, intensive care unit beds and medical professionals and encouraging Americans to practice social distancing as a way of preventing hospitals from being overrun.", "Hannity is wrong to say the U.S. has everything it will need, experts said. U.S. hospitals might be able to deal with the number of patients today \u2014 although experts we spoke to disagreed on whether that was the case \u2014 but the situation will likely look different as it evolves.", "\"We don\u2019t have nearly enough hospital and ICU beds if there is a surge of cases,\" said Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute. \"There is no basis for his assertion.\"", "\"Even a mild surge of COVID patients will stress our ICUs as they have never been stressed before,\" added Eric Toner, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.", "The available data suggests that U.S. hospitals are not as well-equipped as Hannity claimed.", "According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the United States has 2.8 hospital beds per 1,000 people. That ratio puts the U.S. behind other countries \u2014 such as China and Italy \u2014 that have struggled to keep up with the spread of COVID-19.", "That doesn\u2019t bode well for the U.S. response to the coronavirus. As of March 16, Italy has seen more than 24,700 confirmed infections and over 1,800 deaths, according to the World Health Organization.

Some states will be worse off than others.", "In the worst-case scenario \u2014 where 60% of the population gets sick within six months \u2014 the U.S. would need seven times the number of available hospital beds it currently has, the analysis found. Even in a moderate scenario where 40% is infected over 12 months, many cities such as Washington, D.C., would still need to significantly expand hospital capacity.", "Jha, who worked on that project, told us its findings show Hannity\u2019s claim to be wrong.", "The health care system is projected to be overwhelmed by coronavirus patients unless drastic measures are taken.

A more severe scenario could put up to 9.6 million Americans in the hospital and 2.9 million in need of ICUs.", "A separate Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security report identified about 160,000 ventilators in the country, though not all are full-featured. That includes tens of thousands of ventilators in hospitals nationwide and thousands more in an emergency federal stockpile.", "But in 2018, the group estimated that a moderate pandemic similar to the 1957 or 1968 influenza viruses would put about 65,000 people in need of ventilation, and a severe pandemic like the 1918 flu would require ventilators for some 742,500 people.", "Not all COVID-19 patients will need treatment at the same time, of course.
