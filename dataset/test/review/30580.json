["On May 10, The Hindu reported that Indian and Chinese troops had a face-off near Pangong Tso lake in Eastern Ladhak on May 5 and 6, followed by the second one at Naku La, Sikkim on May 9. Since then, the militaries of both the nations nation\u2019s have been on a standoff. On May 14 Army Chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane assured, \u201cWe will deal with it as per the protocol which has been laid out between the two countries and in accordance with strategic guidelines,\u201d as per NDTV report.", "On May 31, an image surfaced on social media that allegedly shows wounded Indian troopers captured by Chinese soldiers. On the same day, academic Ashok Swain tweeted the viral image and wrote, \u201cThis what Chinese soldiers have done to Indian soldiers in Ladakh! Why is Modi silent? Why no demand by Indian media for surgical strike? Where is Mohan Bhagwat\u2019s RSS \u2018Army\u2019?\u201d", "The next day, fake news factory Postcard News posted an image with the title \u2018Rahul Gandhi\u2019s Fake University Project\u2019. The image has three elements \u2014 a screenshot of the tweet by Ashok Swain, a screenshot of a report by Global Times published on May 15, and an image of Indian National Congress President Rahul Gandhi (archive link). The Global Times article read, \u201cChinese soldiers helped Indian solider who got injured in avalanche.\u201d Thus indicating that the image does not show Indian soldiers captures by the Chinese. The graphic carried the text \u201cRahul Gandhi\u2019s fake university project\u201d and attempted to fact-check Swain\u2019s tweet.", "Prior to Postcard, Twitter user @LazyLion_95 had tweeted the same screenshot of the Global Times article and written, \u201cWhen A******* like @ashoswai have so much hatred & afraid of Modi, that they will do anything to defame him & Indian army.\u201d This tweet has over 1,500 retweets (archive link).", "In order to fact-check Swain\u2019s tweet, Postcard relied on an article by Global Times, a China-based news website.

However, Alt News found that no such article exists.", "We Google-searched the headline of the report and restricted the results to Global Times domain. But found no results.", "As per Postcard\u2019s screenshot, the article was written by Sang Feng Wei.", "Alt News performed another domain search via Google. This time we searched the name of the author and just like last time, we found no results.", "Considering the tensions between the two nations, if such an article existed \u2014 about how Chinese soldiers rescued India soldiers after an avalanche \u2014 it would have been covered by mainstream media.", "Therefore, the fact-check by Postcard was based on a non-existent report in Global Times that claimed Chinese soldiers helped Indian soldiers who were injured in an avalanche.", "Looking at the viral image closely it is clear that the legs of two Indian troopers are tied with a rope. Thus, it is highly improbable that Chinese troopers are rescuing the Indian troopers from an avalanche. Instead, it seems that the Chinese have captured and confined the Indian soldiers. Moreover, the fact that the Chinese soldiers are wearing masks indicates that the viral image might be a recent one.", "Alt News performed a reverse image search of the viral image on Google and restricted the results from May 15. We found no links posted on that day which included the viral image.", "The viral image surfaced on Twitter around May 31 via @OedoSoldier who posts tweets related to the Chinese military.
