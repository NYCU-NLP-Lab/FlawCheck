["Thousands of people take part in the \"Free the People Immigration March,'' to protest actions taken by President Donald Trump and his administration, in Los Angeles on Feb. 18, 2017. (AP/Ringo H.W. Chiu)", "Down the stretch in the midterm elections, President Donald Trump has escalated his rhetoric over immigration. For instance, during an Oct. 20 rally in Elko, Nev., he criticized \"sanctuary cities,\" a somewhat fuzzy term that refers to localities that limit their cooperation with federal immigration enforcement authorities.", "\"I don't think we like sanctuary cities up here,\" Trump told the crowd in Nevada. \"By the way, a lot of people in California don't want them, either. They're rioting now. They want to get out of their sanctuary cities.\"", "Is it really the case that in California, \"they're rioting now\" over sanctuary cities?", "We found no evidence of it.", "The White House did not respond to a request for evidence for this article, and Trump himself sidestepped an opportunity to cite specific evidence during remarks to journalists boarding Marine One at the White House on Oct. 22:", "Reporter: \"Hey, Mr. President, you said Californians were rioting over the sanctuary cities. \u00a0Where?\"", "Trump: \"You shouldn\u2019t have \u2014 take a look. They want to get out of sanctuary cities. Many places in California want to get out of sanctuary cities.\"", "Reporter: \"But that's not rioting, sir, right?\"", "Trump: \"Yeah, it is rioting in some cases.\"", "Reporter: \"Where are the riots, sir?\"", "At that point in the media availability, Trump turned to an unrelated question.", "It\u2019s worth noting that there is no broad consensus on the question of whether sanctuary cities are good policy.", "A June 2018 Gallup poll found that 50 percent of those surveyed favored \"banning sanctuary cities,\" while 46 percent opposed a ban. And a March 2018 CBS News poll found that 48 percent favored leaving immigration enforcement policy up to the locality, compared to 47 percent who said localities should be forced to comply with federal authorities. (As we\u2019ve written, the wording of poll questions can make a significant difference on how people answer these questions.)", "And the battle has moved to the courts. In addition to stepping up efforts to get cities to cooperate with federal officials, the Trump administration sued California over its sanctuary\u00a0law. The populous and historically Republican Orange County in suburban Los Angeles moved to join the lawsuit against the state.", "However, the existence of discontent in some quarters doesn\u2019t mean that riots are under way, or were recently.", "We found nothing of the sort in Google searches, and officials from California who would be in a position to know said there was nothing to Trump\u2019s assertion.", "\"Short answer: no,\" said Evan Westrup, a spokesman for California\u2019s Democratic governor, Jerry Brown.", "Jonathan Mu\u00f1oz, a legislative assistant with the California Police Chiefs Association, agreed.", "\"The California Police Chiefs Association is unaware of any riots taking place as a result of the state\u2019s sanctuary city policy,\" Mu\u00f1oz said. \"What we do know is that some cities are challenging the policy in court, but that\u2019s as far as anyone has gone to my knowledge.\"", "Trump said that in California, \"they're rioting now\" over sanctuary cities.", "There is no evidence to support that assertion. We rate the statement Pants on Fire.", "Donald Trump, remarks at a rally in Elko, Nev., Oct. 20, 2018", "Donald Trump, remarks at a press availability at the White House, Oct. 22, 2018", "Pollingreport.com, poll questions on immigration, accessed Oct. 22, 2018", "Reuters, \"California county joins Trump 'sanctuary city' lawsuit,\" March 27, 2018", "PolitiFact, \"Anatomy of a statistic: Do 80 percent of Americans oppose sanctuary cities?\" Feb. 24, 2017", "Email interview with Jonathan Mu\u00f1oz, legislative assistant with the California Police Chiefs Association, Oct. 23, 2018", "Email interview with Evan Westrup, spokesman for Jerry Brown, Oct. 23, 2018", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
