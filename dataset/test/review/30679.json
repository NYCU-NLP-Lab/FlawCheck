["It is well-known by now masks can help prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus. New data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends even better prevention with double masking. But one social media post\u00a0claims wearing a mask may cause serious harm in the long\u00a0run.", "\"Long-Term Mask Use May Contribute to Advanced Stage Lung Cancer, Study Finds,\" asserts a Jan. 29 article from BlackListed News, an independent news platform known to publish pseudoscience and conspiracy-related content.", "How exactly this alarming condition arises\u00a0is through the \"inhalation of harmful microbes\" into the lung that have been \"cultivated through prolonged mask wearing,\" writer Phillip Schneider claims.", "He also provides quotes from lead author Dr. Leopoldo Segal, director of New York University Lagone's Lung Microbiome Program, explaining the scientific basis for these microbes' destructive effect, and ties the study's discovery\u00a0to the larger trend of purported evidence against mask-wearing.", "BlackListed News did not return USA TODAY's request for comment.", "Fact check:Masks encouraged on federal lands if distancing isn't possible", "The human body is a host to millions of different kinds of microorganisms\u00a0inhabiting both the skin surface and deep within various organs, such as the gastrointestinal tract. These bacteria, viruses, fungi and other life forms \u2013 the microbiome \u2013 play a key role in maintaining health and preventing disease. Shifts in microbiome because of aging, long-term dieting, stress\u00a0or pharmaceutical drugs\u00a0have been linked to conditions like\u00a0obesity,\u00a0depression\u00a0and\u00a0autoimmune diseases, among many others.", "They can even contribute to cancer, as some emerging research has found. Segal's study particularly looked at how the microbiome within the lungs \u2013 previously believed a sterile, microorganism-free environment\u00a0\u2013 plays\u00a0into the development of lung cancer, a disease afflicting over 2 million people worldwide and responsible for nearly 1.8 million deaths in 2018, according to the World Health Organization.", "The study analyzed the lung microbiomes of 83 untreated adult patients with lung cancer and found that patients with advanced-stage lung cancer (stage III to IV) \"had greater enrichment of oral commensals in the lung than those who had early-stage disease (stages 1-3a),\" stated a November news release on the study from the American Association for Cancer Research.\u00a0Oral commensals are simply oral bacteria.", "Some of those bacteria are the same ones typically\u00a0found in the respiratory tract's lower airways, such as Prevotella and Veillonella, both of which can cause oral infections and mingle with Streptococcus to form dental plaque (in the case of Veillonella).", "These oral bacteria were found to be associated with \"decreased survival, even after adjusting for tumor stage.\" Veillonella, Prevotella and Streptococcus, in particular, were associated with poor prognosis. All three, plus another bacteria making up the mouth's normal flora, Rothia, were associated with tumor progression.", "The study did report that one limitation to its findings\u00a0\u2013 aside from the study size being too small to allow for patient stratification into subgroups \u2013\u00a0was that since lung microbiomes were sampled prior to patients undergoing their respective cancer treatments, \"changes resulting from treatment could not be assessed.\"", "Fact check:Posts use 2012 photo of Magic Johnson to falsely claim he donated blood", "USA TODAY reviewed the study's paper published online\u00a0this month: Nowhere is long-term mask-wearing mentioned or even alluded to.", "Segal and another author, Dr. James Tsay of NYU's Grossman School of Medicine,\u00a0told Reuters their study did not involve long-term mask-wearing, and that, \"currently there is no scientific evidence to this misinterpretation of our result.\"", "The study's participants were individuals recruited from NYU's Lung Cancer Biomarker Center between March 2013 and October 2018, prior to the pandemic. Tsay stated that \"since mask-wearing was not common during our study period, it is highly unlikely it is one of the reasons that contribute to our findings.\"", "\"The main source of these bacteria to the lung is the mouth and oropharynx (the part of the pharynx that is behind the mouth)\u00a0itself,\" said Segal, explaining these oral bacteria are in \"pretty much every individual\" and how much is present depends\u00a0on oral hygiene and food intake.", "In an email to USA TODAY, Schneider, the author of the BlackListed News article, acknowledged it was his personal view \"this study suggests that prolonged mask-wearing may breed microbes which contribute to advanced-stage lung cancer.\" Schneider\u00a0did not say whether he verified his inference with the study's authors but did add a clarification to the article\u00a0on his website.\u00a0This revision has not been made to the original BlackListed News article.", "Fact check:Masks encouraged on federal lands if distancing isn't possible", "Claims regarding whether face masks work against COVID-19, are detrimental to health (causing oxygen reduction or excessive blood carbon dioxide levels) or violate constitutional amendments have been debunked numerous times.", "The claim in November alleging people were arriving to intensive care units sick with pneumonia from mask-wearing has also been debunked.", "While bacteria and other microorganisms can collect on the inside of a mask, microbiologist Patrick Grant of Florida Atlantic University told CBS Florida affiliate CBS12 that whatever collects does not have the potential to harm unless it is allowed to build up; borrowing someone else's mask is also ill-advised.", "The CDC recommends storing cloth masks properly \u2013 either in plastic bags for wet or damp masks, paper bags for dry or clean ones \u2013 and washing regularly, making sure to dry thoroughly. Disposable masks should be thrown away after one use.", "Fact check:Post distorts WHO's COVID-19 PCR testing guidelines", "The claim that long-term mask-wearing was found by one study to contribute to advanced-stage lung cancer is FALSE, based on our research. The study, headed by Dr. Leopoldo Segal, director of NYU's Lung Microbiome Program, found patients with advanced-stage lung cancer had\u00a0greater amounts of oral bacteria in the lungs compared to early-stage patients. The presence of these bacteria were associated with decreased survival, poor prognosis and tumor progression. Nowhere\u00a0is the impact of long-term mask-wearing or the relationship with lung cancer mentioned or alluded to. The writer of the article making the claim stated that relationship was his own personal view.
