Donald Trump, though, suggested the United States cut back on foreign aid and other military spending in order to keep Social Security solvent.", "Marco Rubio said he often hears people argue that a lot of taxpayer money can be saved by cutting back on foreign aid. That\u2019s not reality, though.", "\"I'm against any sort of wasting of money on foreign aid, but it's less than 1 percent of our federal budget,\" Rubio said. \"We can't just continue to tip-toe around this and throw out things like I'm going to get at fraud and abuse. Let's get rid of fraud, let's get rid of abuse, let's be more careful about how we spend foreign aid. But you still have hundreds of billions of dollars of deficit that you're going to have to make up.\"", "We wanted to fact-check whether foreign aid is less than 1 percent of the federal budget.", "The amount the United States spends on foreign aid depends on who is doing the tally, as a 2011 Congressional Research Service report explained.
