["In the age of\u00a0flying snakes and pets bringing in\u00a0two-headed reptiles,\u00a0an\u00a0old hoax about a seven-headed snake has recently resurfaced on social media.", "\"The Bible spoke of seven headed serpent it was found in honduras,\" reads the caption of a Facebook post\u00a0accompanied by an image of the alleged seven-headed snake.", "The user who shared the photo has not returned USA TODAY's request for comment.", "Fact check: 'Hungover' refers to aftereffects,\u00a0not the practice of sleeping over a rope", "The image of the snake that has been circulating online\u00a0is actually a photo of a normal snake that has been manipulated\u00a0throughout the years.", "The original photo was taken in 2010 and has since been edited many times\u00a0to depict a three-headed snake, a four-headed snake and an eight-headed snake, according to The Daily Moss.", "Sites such as\u00a0Indy100, Snopes and the Hoax-Slayer have all debunked the photo throughout the years.", "Fact check: No evidence Aemilia Bassano wrote Shakespeare's plays", "Polycephaly is a condition where an embryo that has begun to split into identical twins stops before it fully divides, leaving the twins joined.", "According to National Geographic, snakes can also be joined at other places on their bodies \"just as Siamese twins can be joined at the head, breast, or hip,\" and captive inbreeding may cause two-headed births.", "Two-headed snakes typically have one head that is more developed than the other and the heads are known to fight each other over food, The Guardian reported.", "The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission recently wrote on Facebook that two-headed snakes are \"unlikely to survive in the wild as the two brains make different decisions that inhibit the ability to feed or escape from predators.\"", "The image does not show a seven-headed snake discovered in Honduras. The original photo is of a single-headed snake that has been manipulated numerous times throughout the years, and while there are rare cases of two-headed snakes, it does not go beyond that. We rate this claim as FALSE.", "Thank you for supporting our journalism.
