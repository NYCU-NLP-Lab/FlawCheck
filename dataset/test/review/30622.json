["By Saranac Hale Spencer", "Posted on March 31, 2020", "A meme falsely claims that a health care workers\u2019 union was \u201ccaught hiding 39 million N95 masks,\u201d and other posts cast suspicion on the union\u2019s motives. In reality, the union had called medical suppliers nationwide in an effort to find masks \u2014 and it never had or hid them.", "A California health care workers\u2019 union launched a nationwide search on March 21 for face masks and other protective gear that have been in short supply since the COVID-19 pandemic swept across the U.S. On March 26, the union announced that it had found a supplier with 39 million masks.", "Within just a few days, that announcement had become a target of misinformation and suspicion.", "First, some partisan websites suggested there was a connection between the union \u2014 Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West \u2014 and an announcement from Attorney General William Barr the same week. Barr warned that the Justice Department would pursue cases against those who are hoarding essential medical supplies.", "There\u2019s no evidence that the union\u2019s announcement and Barr\u2019s announcement are related. The SEIU-UHW began looking for the equipment on March 21, days before Barr\u2019s March 24 announcement, and it never actually had possession of the masks.", "Regardless, the suggestion was condensed into a meme from the conservative organization Turning Point USA that said: \u201cCoincidence?? Just 3 days after A.G. Barr announced they\u2019re going after hoarders\u2026 SEIU union in California suddenly found a mysterious stash of 39 million face masks.\u201d", "It\u2019s been shared more than 11,000 times from Turning Point USA\u2019s Facebook page and nearly 2,000 times from Iowa Rep. Steve King\u2019s page, as well as other political pages.", "Andrew Kolvet, spokesman for Turning Point USA, told us by email, \u201c[N]othing definitive is stated in the meme, just asking the question, is this a coincidence? It doesn\u2019t actually claim anything illicit or unethical, it just notes the timing is potentially suspicious. It also doesn\u2019t say that the SEIU had the masks, but that \u2018they found them\u2019 in this case from a supplier.\u201d", "The more nuanced parts of that message weren\u2019t clear to many of Turning Point USA\u2019s social media followers, though. The group\u2019s post garnered comments\u00a0like this: \u201cI just want to know how you FIND 39 million face masks and why in the HELL did they have them to begin with?\u201d", "Another meme went further, claiming: \u201cSEIU was CAUGHT HIDING 39 MILLION N95 MASKS The SEIU only \u2018found\u2019 the much-needed masks after Atty. Gen. Barr threatened to file charges against them. People suspect SEIU was hiding the masks to cause a shortage / hurt Trump\u2019s re-election.\u201d", "None of that is true.", "The SEIU-UHW never had the masks. Rather, in an effort to answer the concerns of the health care workers the union represents, the SEIU-UHW started calling suppliers and distributors to locate equipment, according to the union\u2019s announcement.", "\u201cWe just started cold-calling potential suppliers because of the desperate need among the 97,000 healthcare workers we represent in CA and their co-workers, first responders, etc., and hit one who says he can get the masks,\u201d the union\u2019s spokesman, Steve Trossman, told us by email.", "\u201cTo be clear, we are not selling masks, have never had possession of any masks, and have no financial interest in this,\u201d Trossman wrote. \u201cWe are simply connecting hospitals and other entities that need [personal protective equipment] with suppliers we have found who say they have supplies.\u201d", "The U.S. has faced a shortage of face masks since COVID-19 began sickening Americans, but the\u00a0Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u00a0and the\u00a0World Health Organization both recommend that, outside of health care settings, only those who are sick or caring for someone who is sick need to wear a mask. However, CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield, who is also on the White House task force dealing with the coronavirus outbreak, recently said\u00a0data that could suggest wider use of masks may help prevent the spread of the virus\u00a0\u201cis being aggressively reviewed.\u201d The\u00a0CDC\u00a0has\u00a0said that it currently has no plans to issue new guidance.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.

Remarks by President Trump, Vice President Pence, and Members of the Coronavirus Task Force in Press Briefing. Whitehouse.gov. 24 Mar 2020.", "Trossman, Steve. Spokesman, Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West. Email response. 30 Mar 2020.", "Kolvet, Andrew. Spokesman, Turning Point USA. Email response. 30 Mar 2020.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
