["In observance of Black History Month, many Americans are reflecting on Black people's triumphs against racism through history. Some are using social media to call out past injustices. One viral post makes the unproven claim that fashion brand Louis Vuitton sponsored 19th- and 20th-century \"human zoos\" that put people of color on display for entertainment.", "The post\u00a0describes human zoos that displayed Black people as \u201cexotic creatures\u201d in New York, St. Louis,\u00a0Australia and other countries at the turn of the century.", "The claim is accompanied by two black and white photos: one of a building decorated with the Louis Vuitton moniker and a large piece of African art and another of a Black child and a crowd of white onlookers separated by a fence.", "Fact check:Image claiming to show 2016 Ted Cruz tweet on climate change and Texas is fabricated", "Artist Trey Songz bolstered the claim when he posted it on\u00a0Instagram on Feb. 17. His post included the same two images and also referenced human zoos in France.", "Songz credited the post to clothing brand\u00a0Cointel, though there is no record of the post on\u00a0its Instagram account.", "Before Songz, radio and TV host Lady Joi posted the claim on Facebook Feb. 13. She removed that post after USA TODAY contacted her for comment.", "This claim has reappeared on social media\u00a0during Black History Month for several years. Snopes investigated the claim in March 2019 and could find no supporting evidence.", "Human zoos did exist in the 19th and 20th centuries in Europe and the United States. The BBC reported 35,000 people were part of the displays and most were paid. The last one closed in 1958 in Belgium.", "USA TODAY could find no evidence the couture brand Louis Vuitton sponsored them.", "None of the posters USA TODAY reached out to for comment replied.", "A spokesperson for the company said in an email to USA TODAY that the claim was \"completely false.\"", "Louis Vuitton's official statement provided by the spokesperson on the\u00a0claim read:\u00a0\u201cThis allegation is completely false. In fact, Louis Vuitton used booths at exhibitions to showcase products in the 1920s and 30s.\u00a0The first photograph is of Louis Vuitton\u2019s booth at the Exposition Coloniale Internationale in Paris in 1931 in which the brand showcased trunks and beauty cases, among other objects. We have made this clear in the past and we are doing so again now in the strongest possible terms. The second photograph has absolutely no affiliation with our brand\u00a0whatsoever.\u201d", "A 2011 French blog\u00a0post on the website Brand Memory described\u00a0how Louis Vuitton exhibited products at several world fairs. The blog was originally published in French and can be translated to English through Google, leaving room for confusion.", "It described Louis Vuitton\u2019s African-influenced designs, which it presented at the 1931 World's Fair in Paris.\u00a0Louis Vuitton presented products like leather trunks and ivory objects at the colonialism-themed event. The blog post does not say the fashion brand sponsored\u00a0human zoos, although human zoos were part of separate exhibits.", "The same image of the Louis Vuitton building and African structure is featured in the article. Snopes identified the building in the image widely shared with the claim as the pavilion from that 1931 fair.", "The 1931 Paris Colonial Exhibition featured an exhibit that displayed naked and semi-naked human beings in cages. According to Ferris State University, the exhibit had 34 million attendees in six months.", "The fair\u00a0sought to celebrate colonialism and stimulate the French public\u2019s interest in its colonial empire.", "Gaston Louis Vuitton, the grandson of Louis Vuitton\u2019s namesake founder, presented an African-influenced mask collection in a separate Louis Vuitton pavilion at the exposition. The Globe and Mail reported that Gaston Vuitton had a \"very public love for old-school colonialism and French fascism.\"", "While Louis Vuitton did participate in the fair and present products that appropriated African culture, there is no evidence the fashion brand sponsored the human zoo separately exhibited at the fair.", "We rate the claim that Louis Vuitton sponsored racist \"human zoos\" in the 19th and 20th centuries FALSE\u00a0because\u00a0it is not supported by our research. A company spokesperson confirmed the claim is not true.\u00a0Louis Vuitton exhibited products that appropriated African culture at the 1931 Paris Colonial Exhibition, where Black people in cages were displayed at a separate exhibit. However, there is no evidence Louis Vuitton sponsored this separate exhibit or another human zoo at a different event.", "Thank you for supporting our journalism.
