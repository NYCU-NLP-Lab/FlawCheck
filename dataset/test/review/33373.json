In remarks, Obama noted that the White House hosts an Iftar dinner each year, and said that the Eid event was a way to \u201cdo something a little different\u201d for his last year as president.", "But this was a one-time engagement that the White House publicized, not \u201cone of Obama\u2019s most secretive rituals,\u201d as the Resistance story claimed.", "Readers shouldn\u2019t take the Resistance\u2019s claims at face value because the website admits to pushing fake news.
