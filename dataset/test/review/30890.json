He then drew a contrast with what whites experience.", "\"When you\u2019re white, you don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to be living in a ghetto. You don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to be poor.

But when he moves into the subject of whites\u2019 experience with poverty, he\u2019s on weak ground. Sanders\u2019 suggestion that white Americans haven\u2019t experienced poverty is undercut by statistics calculated by the U.S. Census Bureau.", "Since the 1960s, the Census Bureau has tracked the numbers and percentages of Americans by race who have an income level that puts them at the poverty line.

In 2014, there were actually more white Americans in poverty -- 19.7 million -- than members of any other group.", "Part of the reason, of course, is that there are more white Americans than there are members of minority groups overall. (Whites account for 62 percent of the population.) Still, even though whites have a lower poverty rate than other groups -- roughly 10 percent -- even that percentage is hardly trivial.", "The numbers are similar if you raise the income level slightly. At 125 percent of the poverty level, the number of white Americans rises to about 26.5 million. That\u2019s a lot of white people who are in or near poverty.", "\"This was a misstatement. A lot of white people know what it\u2019s like to be poor,\" said Julia Isaacs, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute.", "If you look at the poor as a group, minorities are disproportionately represented. Still, the white population is large enough that the majority of the people in poverty are white.

As the chart indicates, the white share has fallen, but it\u2019s still the largest of any of the four groups studied.", "Sanders said the day after the debate that he misspoke, telling reporters, \"What I meant to say is when you talk about ghettos traditionally, what you talk about is African-American communities.
