Local newspapers, including Sun Newspapers, Vanguard and Sahara Reporters, used the same image in their reports about\u00a0the alleged assassination bid.", "All three newspapers relied solely on a press statement from Nnamdi Kanu, IPOBs fugitive leader. In the statement, Kanu alleged that the \u201cNigerian Army and police have taken it upon themselves to assassinate IPOB lawyers\u201d in order to keep the separatists from challenging officials in court.", "Kanu, a British-Nigerian political activist, and a former London real estate agent, claimed that Okoroafor\u00a0was attacked because he had discovered an army base where 110 innocent civilians were being held.", "However, the image of the shot-up SUV is unrelated to the claimed hit attempt on Okoroafor. By running multiple reverse image searches, AFP Fact Check found the original photo dates back to 2013.", "It shows the aftermath of a shooting in\u00a0Boston in the United States in April 2013 as police hunted the perpetrators of the fatal bombing that had rocked the city\u2019s famed marathon a few days earlier.", "Online articles in Today and NBC News feature the same photo, which also appears in a blog post that aggregated news reports of the attack.", "A reverse image search of the second picture featured\u00a0in the Facebook post led to the Adobe Stock images website. The photo of shell casings on the ground\u00a0was uploaded here for purchase in September 2019.", "Mohammed Yerima, the spokesperson for the Nigerian Army, told AFP by phone that there is \u201cno truth to the claim and precious time should not be wasted on it\u201d.", "\u201c[The] Army doesn\u2019t attack individuals,\u201d\u00a0Yerima said.", "Repeated attempts to get comments from both the police and Okoroafor were unsuccessful. Their responses will be included should they reply.", "Kanu and the IPOB are known for spreading misinformation online, especially on Facebook, which\u00a0recently removed Kanu\u2019s account for \u201crepeated violation of its community rules\u201d.", "Since his removal from Facebook, Kanu continues to use other means to communicate, including an online radio platform called Radio Biafra.", "AFP Fact Check has previously debunked other claims\u00a0by Kanu and his supporters\u00a0here, here and here.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
