["In a Dec. 7, 2010, press conference, President Barack Obama began the effort to sell a deal he struck with the Republican congressional leadership to extend the tax cuts initially passed under George W. Bush.", "Under the agreement, the tax cuts will be extended for two years for all income brackets, rather than just for families below $250,000 and individuals below $200,000 in taxable income, as Obama had vowed during the campaign and as many congressional Democrats have preferred. In exchange for a temporary extension of the cuts for wealthier Americans -- which Republicans wanted -- the GOP agreed to extend federal unemployment benefits and tax cuts passed under Obama that were also set to expire at the end of the year.\n\nAs expected, Obama faced tough questions from the assembled reporters about his decision to give in to the GOP demand to extend tax cuts for all Americans.\n\nThe first question, from\u00a0 Associated Press reporter Ben Feller, was: \"You've been telling the American people all along that you oppose extending the tax cuts for the wealthier Americans. You said that again today. But what you never said was that you opposed the tax cuts, but you'd be willing to go ahead and extend them for a couple of years if the politics of the moment demand it. So what I'm wondering is, when you take a stand like you had, why should the American people believe that you're going to stick with it? Why should the American people believe that you're not going to flip-flop?\"\n\nObama said, in part, that \"if there was not collateral damage -- if this was just a matter of my politics or being able to persuade the American people to my side -- then I would just stick to my guns, because the fact of the matter is the American people already agree with me. There are polls showing right now that the American people for the most part think it's a bad idea to provide tax cuts to the wealthy.", "\"But the issue is not me persuading the American people -- they're already there. The issue is how do I persuade the Republicans in the Senate who are currently blocking that position. I have not been able to budge them, and I don't think there's any suggestion anybody in this room thinks realistically that we can budge them right now.\"", "We were intrigued by Obama's argument that the American people were with him in their preferences on tax policy, since a few days earlier we had fact-checked a statement by incoming House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, that was in some ways the mirror image of what Obama argued.", "Boehner, in comments to reporters on Dec. 1, said that \"the American people spoke pretty loudly. They said stop all the looming tax hikes....\" We gauged the accuracy of Boehner's claim by looking at four public opinion polls taken since the election that asked questions about what should be done with the Bush tax cuts.\n\nWe concluded that the polls showed that while many Americans opposed an across-the-board expiration of the Bush tax cuts, it was not accurate for Boehner to say that the public spoke \"pretty loudly\" that Congress should \"stop all the looming tax hikes.\" In fact, we found that a plurality of the \"American people\" actually supported what amounts to a tax hike for the wealthiest Americans. So we rated Boehner's comment False.", "We'll add one new poll to the mix of those we used in the Boehner item. Here's the full data:", "CBS News, Nov. 29-Dec. 1, 2010", "The tax cuts should...", "Continue for all: 26 percent", "Continue for households below $250,000: 53 percent", "Expire for all: 14 percent", "USA Today/Gallup poll, Nov. 19-21, 2010", "What do you think Congress should do about the income tax cuts passed under George W.

And those respondents ranged from 39 percent to 53 percent in the five polls.\n\nSo overall, the poll numbers support Obama\u2019s general point, but they don\u2019t fully justify his claim that \"the American people for the most part think it\u2019s a bad idea.\" Actually, in most of the polls just a plurality says that.
