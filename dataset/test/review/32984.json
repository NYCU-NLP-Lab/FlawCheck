And that undermines Trump\u2019s argument.", "The following chart shows that the number of tests across the country has risen steadily since late March. The orange line shows how the positivity rate has changed over time.", "Initially, the rise in tests did show the pattern Trump touted: As more tests were conducted, the percentage of positive results declined. After peaking above 20% positive in early April, the positivity rate fell to about 4% in early June.", "A likely reason for this pattern is that early in the pandemic, tests were scarce and were reserved for people who showed visible symptoms. As testing kits became more widely accessible for people without obvious symptoms, a wider cross-section of the population was tested, with a resulting decline in tests showing the patient was infected.", "The problem for Trump\u2019s assertion is that the decline in the positive rate reversed itself in early June.", "The positivity rate bottomed out around June 10 at about 4.3%. By June 22, it had risen to about 5.3%.", "That may not sound like a big increase, but if more infections are being tallied simply because more tests are being given, as Trump suggested, the positivity rate should be going down, or at least staying about the same, not rising.", "\"The up-turn in positive rate is sufficient to debunk\" what Trump said about testing, \"particularly given that the total number tests conducted is at its highest yet, and still we see an increase in the seven-day rolling positive rate,\" said Brooke Nichols, an infectious disease modeler at the Boston University School of Public Health.", "The rise in the positivity rate appears to be driven by a handful of states.", "Early coronavirus hot spots, notably New York, have seen a decline in new infections despite widespread testing.
