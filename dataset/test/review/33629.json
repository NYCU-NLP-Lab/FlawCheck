["By Eugene Kiely", "Posted on July 6, 2017 | Updated on July 7, 2017", "On the eve of his first meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, President Donald Trump made some questionable claims about the U.S. intelligence community\u2019s finding that Russia hacked into U.S. political organizations to interfere in the 2016 presidential election:", "The president made his remarks\u00a0during a joint press conference with\u00a0Polish President Andrzej Duda in Warsaw on July 6. Trump made the stop in Poland on his way to\u00a0a Group of 20 summit meeting in Germany, where he is scheduled to meet with Putin on July 7.", "Hallie Jackson of NBC News asked the president if he would \u201conce and for all, yes or no, definitively say that Russia interfered in the 2016 election.\u201d He gave a less-than-definitive answer.", "Trump, July 6:\u00a0I think it was Russia. And I think it could have been other people and other countries. It could have been a lot of people interfered. I\u2019ve said it very simply. I think it could very well have been Russia but I think it could very well have been other countries, and I won\u2019t be specific. But I think a lot of people interfere. I think it has been happening for a long time. It has been happening for many, many years.", "There is no evidence that other countries were involved in the cyberattacks.", "The Department of Homeland Security and Office of the Director of National Intelligence issued a\u00a0joint statement\u00a0on Oct. 7, 2016, that said the U.S. intelligence community is \u201cconfident\u201d that hacks into the email systems of the Democratic Party and its officials were directed by \u201cRussia\u2019s senior most officials.\u201d The U.S. intelligence community includes 17 separate intelligence agencies.", "\u201cSuch activity is not new to Moscow \u2014 the Russians have used similar tactics and techniques across Europe and Eurasia, for example, to influence public opinion there,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWe believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia\u2019s senior-most officials could have authorized these activities.\u201d", "After the election, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence issued a declassified report on Jan. 6 that went even further. That report said that \u201cPutin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump\u201d and that\u00a0\u201cPutin ordered an influence campaign\u201d to help Trump and damage his opponent, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.", "The 25-page report\u00a0was \u201cdrafted and coordinated\u201d among three intelligence agencies \u2014 the CIA, FBI and the National Security Agency \u2014 based on \u201cintelligence information collected and disseminated by those three agencies.\u201d", "Among other things, the report said, Russian military intelligence gained access to Democratic National Committee computers from July 2015 to June 2016 and then used WikiLeaks, DCLeaks.com and \u201cGuccifer 2.0, who claimed to be an independent Romanian hacker,\u201d to publicly release hacked emails\u00a0and documents. The cyberattacks and public release of hacked material were part of larger \u201cRussian propaganda efforts\u201d to hurt Clinton and help Trump, the report said.", "\u201cRussia\u2019s state-run propaganda machine \u2014 comprised of its domestic media apparatus, outlets targeting global audiences such as RT and Sputnik, and a network of quasi-government trolls \u2014 contributed to the influence campaign by serving as a platform for Kremlin messaging to Russian and international audiences,\u201d the report said. \u201cState-owned Russian media made increasingly favorable comments about President-elect Trump as the 2016 US general and primary election campaigns progressed while consistently offering negative coverage of Secretary Clinton.\u201d", "In sworn testimony before the Senate intelligence committee on June 8, former FBI Director James Comey said there should be no confusion that Russia interfered with the election.", "Comey, June 8: There should be no fuzz on this whatsoever. The Russians interfered in our election during the 2016 cycle. They did with purpose. They did it with sophistication. They did it with overwhelming technical efforts. It was an active measures campaign driven from the top of that government. There is no fuzz on that. It is a high confidence judgment of the entire intelligence community and the members of this committee have seen the intelligence. It\u2019s not a close call. That happened. That\u2019s about as unfake as you can possibly get. It is very, very serious, which is why it\u2019s so refreshing to see a bipartisan focus on that. This is about America, not about a particular party.", "Of course, this isn\u2019t the first time that Trump has questioned U.S. intelligence on Russia. He did so before and after winning the election, sometimes in the same way as he did at his Warsaw press conference.", "After the election,\u00a0Trump issued\u00a0a statement on Dec. 9 that compared U.S. intelligence on Russia\u2019s election meddling to U.S. intelligence on\u00a0Iraq\u2019s weapons of mass destruction. At his press conference in Poland, Trump again raised the issue of WMDs. He said \u201ceverybody was 100 percent sure that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction,\u201d but faulty intelligence \u201cled to one big mess.\u201d", "And, as he did in Poland, Trump told Time magazine in a\u00a0Nov. 28, 2016, interview:\u00a0\u201cIt could be Russia. And it could be China. And it could be some guy in his home in New Jersey.\u201d", "But no evidence to date has emerged that China or any other country was involved.", "Update, July 7: Two House members \u2013 a Republican and a Democrat \u2013 said they have seen no evidence that any country other than Russia interfered in the 2016 election.", "CNN\u2019s John Berman asked Rep. Jim Himes in a July 6 interview: \u201c[H]ave you seen any evidence that any other country besides Russia tried to meddle in the 2016 election?\u201d Himes, a Democratic member of the House intelligence committee, responded, \u201cNone. None.\u201d", "Republican Rep. Michael McCaul, chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security, said in a July 7 interview on MSNBC that the intelligence reports and briefings that he has received show \u201cvery clear and convincing evidence that it was a nation state attack by Russia.\u201d", "FactCheck.org Rating:", "Read More", "Even though he continues to question the U.S. intelligence community\u2019s findings, Trump criticized Obama for doing \u201cnothing\u201d about Russia\u2019s attempts to influence the election.", "Trump, July 6: Now, the thing I have to mention is that Barack Obama, when he was president, found out about this in terms of if it were Russia, found out about it in August. Now the election was in November. That\u2019s a lot of time. He did nothing about it. Why did he do nothing about it? He was told it was Russia by the CIA, as I understand it. It was well reported. And he did nothing about it. They say he choked. Well, I don\u2019t think he choked. I think what happened is he thought Hillary Clinton was going to win the election and he said, \u201cLet\u2019s not do anything about it.\u201d Had he thought the other way he would have done something about it.", "Trump is referring to a\u00a0Washington Post\u00a0story \u2014 \u201cObama\u2019s secret struggle to punish Russia for Putin\u2019s election assault\u201d \u2014 that said Obama received a CIA report in early August that detailed Putin\u2019s \u201cdirect involvement in a cyber campaign to disrupt and discredit the U.S. presidential race.\u201d The story said the CIA \u201ccaptured Putin\u2019s specific instructions on the operation\u2019s audacious objectives \u2014 defeat or at least damage the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, and help elect her opponent, Donald Trump.\u201d", "The Post story detailed the internal debate within the Obama administration on what action to take against Russia.", "Washington Post, June 23:\u00a0It took time for other parts of the intelligence community to endorse the CIA\u2019s view [on Putin\u2019s objectives]. Only in the administration\u2019s final weeks in office did it tell the public, in a declassified report, what officials had learned from [CIA Director John] Brennan in August \u2014 that Putin was working to elect Trump.", "Over that five-month interval, the Obama administration secretly debated dozens of options for deterring or punishing Russia, including cyberattacks on Russian infrastructure, the release of CIA-gathered material that might embarrass Putin and sanctions that officials said could \u201ccrater\u201d the Russian economy.", "It wasn\u2019t until Dec. 29 that Obama\u00a0announced\u00a0that he would impose sanctions on Russia for interfering in the election. At the time, Trump\u00a0criticized\u00a0the sanctions. \u201cIt\u2019s time for our country to move on to bigger and better things,\u201d Trump said in a statement.", "There are\u00a0certainly\u00a0Democrats\u00a0who believe that Obama didn\u2019t do enough to alert the public about the extent of Russia\u2019s meddling in the election. But Trump goes too far when he \u2014 repeatedly \u2014 says that Obama \u201cdid nothing about it.\u201d", "So, what did Obama and his administration do from early August until Election Day on Nov. 8?", "Obama answered that question during a Dec. 16 press conference when he was asked about the \u201cperception that you\u2019re letting President Putin get away with interfering in the U.S. election.\u201d At the time, the president had yet to impose sanctions, which would not come for nearly two more weeks.", "Obama, Dec. 16: At the beginning of the summer, we\u2019re alerted to the possibility that the DNC has been hacked, and I immediately order law enforcement as well as our intelligence teams to find out everything about it, investigate it thoroughly, to brief the potential victims of this hacking, to brief on a bipartisan basis the leaders of both the House and the Senate and the relevant intelligence committees. And once we had clarity and certainty around what, in fact, had happened, we publicly announced that, in fact, Russia had hacked into the DNC.", "That public announcement was made, as we said earlier, in a statement by the Department of Homeland Security and DNI on Oct. 7. But that announcement competed for public attention with other major breaking news in that same 24-hour news cycle: The Washington Post\u00a0published a story and video of lewd comments that Trump made about women while talking with Billy Bush, then of \u201cAccess Hollywood.\u201d", "In addition to the Oct. 7 announcement, Obama also said that he confronted Putin about the hacking at a G-20 summit in September.", "Obama, Dec. 16:\u00a0And so in early September, when I saw President Putin in China, I felt that the most effective way to ensure that that didn\u2019t happen was to talk to him directly and tell him to cut it out, and there were going to be some serious consequences if he didn\u2019t. And, in fact, we did not see further tampering of the election process. But the leaks through WikiLeaks had already occurred.", "WikiLeaks began to release\u00a0hacked emails on July 22 \u2014 about two weeks before Obama had been briefed by the CIA on Putin\u2019s direct role in the hacking. That damage was already done, so the Obama administration turned its attention to securing the nation\u2019s voting systems.", "Obama said his \u201cprincipal goal leading up to the election\u201d was to prevent Russia from hacking into voting systems and tampering with registration rolls and ballots. That was accomplished through the Department of Homeland Security, and it started at about the time that Obama first learned in mid-August about Putin\u2019s desire to help Trump win the election.", "On Aug. 15, then-Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson held a conference call with members of the National Association of Secretaries of State and other election officials. A readout of the call said, \u201cWhile DHS is not aware of any specific or credible cybersecurity threats relating to the upcoming general election systems, Secretary Johnson reiterated that DHS, the Election Assistance Commission, NIST, and DOJ are available to offer support and assistance in protecting against cyber attacks.\u201d He also said that the department \u201cwould be examining whether designating certain electoral systems as critical infrastructure would be an effective way to offer this support.\u201d", "The designation of \u201ccritical infrastructure\u201d\u00a0would have given states \u201cpriority in terms of the assistance we give on cyber security,\u201d Johnson testified at a June 21 House intelligence committee hearing on Russia\u2019s meddling. Other sectors designated as \u201ccritical\u201d include the defense, energy and financial sectors, according to the Department of Homeland Security.", "Many state officials were \u201cresisting the idea of a designation to be critical infrastructure,\u201d Johnson testified.", "On Aug. 29, two weeks after Johnson\u2019s conference call with election officials, the\u00a0Washington Post reported that hackers were targeting voter registration systems in Arizona and Illinois. The story said, \u201c[T]he FBI alerted Arizona officials in June that Russians were behind the assault on the election system in that state.\u201d", "On Sept. 15, the Election Assistance Commission issued security tips for securing voter registration databases. A day later,\u00a0Johnson issued a statement that warned about attacks on voter registration data.", "\u201cIn recent months we have seen cyber intrusions involving political institutions and personal communications,\u201d Johnson\u2019s statement said. \u201cWe have also seen some efforts at cyber intrusions of voter registration data maintained in state election systems.\u201d", "On Oct. 1,\u00a0Johnson issued another statement that warned about attacks on voting-related systems, including a few successful attacks. \u201cIn recent months, malicious cyber actors have been scanning a large number of state systems, which could be a preamble to attempted intrusions,\u201d the statement said. \u201cIn a few cases, we have determined that malicious actors gained access to state voting-related systems. However, we are not aware at this time of any manipulation of data.\u201d", "The statement urged states to seek the department\u2019s help to secure their voting data and equipment. \u201cSo far, 21 states have contacted us about our services,\u201d the statement said. By Oct. 10, that number had risen to 33 states, the department said.", "\u201cI can tell you for certain that, in the late summer, fall, I was very concerned about what I was seeing, and this was on my front burner all throughout the pre-election period in August, September, October, and early November \u2014 to encourage the states to come in and seek our assistance,\u201d Johnson testified. \u201cAnd I\u2019m glad that most of them, red and blue, did.\u201d", "In the end, there was no evidence that votes were changed, Johnson told the House committee.", "Trump \u2014 as Democrats have done \u2014 can question whether the Obama administration did enough. That\u2019s an opinion. But Trump is wrong to say Obama \u201cdid nothing\u201d from early August to Nov. 8. In addition to directly raising the issue with Putin, Obama\u2019s administration worked with state officials to secure voting machines and issued a statement identifying Russia as the state actor behind the cyberattacks.", "FactCheck.org Rating:", "Read More", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population.
