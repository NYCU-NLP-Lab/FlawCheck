["On March 3, 2021, the Kenya Catholic Doctors Association released a press statement titled \u201cStopping Ravages And Loss of Human Life from COVID19\u201d. The nine-page document included multiple false or misleading claims about treatments and testing for Covid-19, and promoted unfounded\u00a0population control conspiracies.", "\u201cWe know for a fact that there are drugs that have been repurposed and used effectively to treat Covid-19. We also know that vaccination for this disease is totally unnecessary making the motivation suspect,\u201d reads the statement.", "The document also claims that there are \u201cpartisan interests that seem bent on keeping some important truths from coming to the fore at the expense of human life\u201d.", "The statement\u00a0was released the day after more than\u00a0one million Oxford-AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccines arrived in Kenya, where it appeared on news sites (see here and here) and on social media.", "The association\u2019s chairman, Dr Stephen Karanja, is known for voicing anti-vaccination\u00a0sentiments. In 2014, Karanja stated he was opposed to the tetanus vaccine and also spoke out against the vaccine for cervical cancer in 2019.", "The Catholic Bishops in Kenya distanced themselves from the association\u2019s statement and expressed support for the Kenyan government\u2019s efforts to provide Covid-19 vaccines to the population.", "On March 10, Kenya\u2019s Minister of Health, Mutahi Kagwe also assured the public of the vaccine\u2019s efficacy and safety.", "The World Health Organization (WHO) noted that although Covid-19 vaccines were rapidly developed, \u201cthe regulatory and scientific reviews of the vaccines have not been compromised\u201d.", "\u201cThe AstraZeneca vaccine produced by the Serum Institute of India and now being distributed in Kenya has been reviewed and found safe not only by the WHO\u2019s rigorous process but also by the stringent regulatory authorities, including the United States FDA (Food and Drug Administration) and the European regulatory authority,\u201d\u00a0WHO said in response to the doctors\u2019\u00a0statement.", "AFP Fact Check debunked several of the inaccurate claims made by the Kenya Catholic Doctors Association below.", "In the press statement, the Catholic doctors recommended three \u201ceffective\u201d treatment methods for Covid-19: inhaling steam several times a day; taking ivermectin tablets; and following the Zelenko protocol, which entails\u00a0taking a combination of drugs daily for a week.", "However, none of these methods has been scientifically proven to treat Covid-19, according to medical experts.", "AFP Fact Check has previously debunked steam inhalation as a treatment for Covid-19 here and here.", "\u201cThis claim is not based on scientific evidence. WHO hasn\u2019t received data from clinical trials which can support such a claim,\u201d\u00a0Collins Boakye-Agyemang, WHO spokesman for the Africa regional office, told AFP Fact Check in March 2021.", "AFP Fact Check has previously fact-checked claims about the second suggested Covid-19 treatment, the anti-parasite drug ivermectin, here.", "On March 5, 2021, the FDA\u00a0warned against the use of the drug after receiving reports of patients who needed medical help\u00a0or were hospitalised after self-medicating with ivermectin.", "\u201cThe FDA has not reviewed data to support use of ivermectin in Covid-19 patients to treat or to prevent Covid-19; however, some initial research is underway. Taking a drug for unapproved use can be very dangerous. This is true of ivermectin, too,\u201d reads the FDA\u2019s statement.", "The third suggested treatment is a cocktail of hydroxychloroquine, zinc, and Azithromycin (an antibiotic), taken\u00a0for seven days.", "Known as the\u00a0Zelenko protocol, it\u00a0emerged last year when New York doctor Vladimir Zelenko claimed to have used this method to successfully treat 699 Covid-19 patients. However, Zelenko ended up being investigated by a federal prosecutor after he claimed that his three-drug regimen was FDA-approved. Zelenko later acknowledged that he had misinterpreted his conversation with an FDA representative about his concoction receiving approval.", "While hydroxychloroquine has been touted as a treatment for Covid-19 by many people, including former US President Donald Trump, its effectiveness is not supported by FDA or other medical experts.", "Last year, the FDA issued \u2014 and then revoked \u2014 an emergency use authorisation for the drug, noting it was \u201cunlikely to be effective in treating COVID-19\u201d, adding that the potential benefits did\u00a0not outweigh the known risks, including serious cardiac events.", "In its press statement, the Kenya Catholic Doctors Association claimed that the PCR tests used to detect Covid-19 infections are inaccurate. This is false.", "PCR stands for Polymerase Chain Reaction, a process used to amplify DNA that detects the presence of a virus in the body. PCR tests work by scanning the RNA in a sample, such as a nose swab, to detect the virus.", "AFP Fact Check has previously debunked claims that PCR tests do not detect Covid-19.", "Kenya\u2019s Ministry of Health Director-General Dr Patrick Amoth told AFP Fact Check that PCR testing is the most accurate and reliable Covid-19 test.", "\u201cPCR is the gold standard test for Covid-19 globally and is the best for which others are compared to,\u201d\u00a0Amoth said during a phone interview.", "Dr Hanan Balkhy, a professor of paediatrics and infectious diseases, said in an interview with WHO\u2019s Vismita Gupta-Smith that PCR testing is the most accurate Covid-19 test.", "The doctors also claimed\u00a0that both the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna Covid-19 vaccines are not real vaccines. This claim is false.", "Both rely on a technology known as messenger RNA (mRNA) to activate the immune system against the virus. Each vaccine uses synthetic genetic material that can be generated and manufactured in weeks and produced at scale more rapidly than conventional vaccines. Even with the new technological developments, both are considered vaccines.", "The Pfizer website and fact sheet refer to the Covid-19 vaccine as the \u201cPfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine\u201d on multiple pages (see here,\u00a0 here, and here).", "Moderna also refers to its Covid-19 shot as a \u201cvaccine\u201d on its website. Moderna\u00a0CEO St\u00e9phane Bancel\u00a0can also be heard calling the company\u2019s Covid-19 jab a vaccine in an interview with Yahoo Finance.", "The FDA has reviewed safety data from clinical trials for both vaccines and granted them emergency use authorisation, as indicated here and here.", "The press statement also questions the injection of vaccines into muscles.", "\u201cWhen we started injecting the antigen beyond the epithelial layer into the muscles, we breached the natural function of the immune systems,\u201d\u00a0the document says.", "This claim has \u201cno merit\u201d, according to Shabir Madhi, a South African professor of vaccinology.", "\u201cFor some of the vaccine, eg mRNA, injection into the muscle is required to get the cells to produce the spike protein which is then presented to the immune system,\u201d Madhi told AFP Fact Check.", "Vaccines are administered using different routes, but injecting into the muscle tissue is most common, according to Madhi.", "\u201cMost vaccines are given through the intramuscular route,\u201d he said.", "Medical experts have explained the benefits of injecting vaccines into the muscles (see here and here).", "The press statement falsely claims that Covid-19 vaccines are part of a plan by American billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates to depopulate the world.", "The theory stems from a misinterpretation of an excerpt from a speech\u00a0Gates gave at a TED conference in 2010\u00a0where he\u00a0discussed reducing global population growth through new vaccines and improved healthcare in order to lower carbon emissions.", "\u201cFirst we\u2019ve got a population. The world today has 6.8 billion people. That\u2019s headed up to about nine billion. Now, if we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care, reproductive health services, we could lower that by, perhaps 10 or 15 percent. But there, we see an increase of about 1.3,\u201d\u00a0Gates said.", "The philanthropist was referring to cutting global population growth by \u201c10 or 15 percent\u201d to curb carbon emissions, not reducing the current human population.", "AFP Fact Check has previously debunked a similar claim here, while the Bill &\u00a0Melinda Gates Foundation told AFP Fact Check it was\u00a0false.", "Although some countries recently temporarily suspended a batch of AstraZeneca vaccines while investigating blood clots in certain patients (see here), both the WHO and European Union regulators said that \u201cthe vaccine\u2019s benefits continue to outweigh its risks\u201d and that the AstraZeneca \u201cvaccine can continue to be administered\u201d while the investigation is ongoing.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
