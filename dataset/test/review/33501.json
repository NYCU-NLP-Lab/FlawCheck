It contends that Feingold\u2019s time in Washington changed him for the worse.", "\"His values decayed, his principles eroded and he lost touch with Wisconsin,\" the narrator says midway into the ad. \"He wanted to get money out of politics. Now he\u2019s profiting from that same dark money.\"", "Feingold has long championed campaign finance reforms, though he earned a Full Flop on our Flip-O-Meter for reversing his position on raising most of his campaign funds from Wisconsin residents.", "But is Feingold \"profiting\" from \"dark money\"?

Instead, nearly half of the $7.1 million that had been spent went to raising more money for itself.", "The article also said Feingold and nine of his former campaign and U.S. Senate staffers drew salaries or consulting fees from the PAC, and five of them also spent time on the payroll of Progressives United Inc., the nonprofit.", "PACs, however, are required to disclose their donors. So, our focus here is on the Progressives United Inc. nonprofit.
