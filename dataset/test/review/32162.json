["Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace interviews Rep. Donna Edwards, D-Md., about the causes of the unrest in Baltimore.", "The Baltimore riot has many people talking about how life could be improved in neighborhoods that have been in the grip of poverty for many decades. Rep. Donna Edwards, D-Md., said on\u00a0Fox News Sunday\u00a0that investing in schools is an obvious step.", "But host Chris Wallace pushed back.", "\"It\u2019s not a matter of money,\" Wallace said on May 3, 2015. \"One of the things that we learned this week is Baltimore spends the third-highest per capita on its public schools. Baltimore was already spending plenty on public schools, and the schools were still lousy.\"", "To get to \"third-highest,\"\u00a0Wallace is counting only the 100 largest school districts -- and lopping off more affluent communities in the process.", "Fox News told us that Wallace relied on a Census Bureau release that compared the\u00a0100 largest school districts\u00a0nationwide. (Wallace misspoke slightly. He should have said per-pupil spending,\u00a0not per capita.)
