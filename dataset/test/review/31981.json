["About this rating", "In May 2017, the web site Conservative Post published an article about actor Matthew McConaughey that was misleadingly titled: \"MATTHEW McCONAUGHEY Just \u2018CAME OUT OF THE CLOSET\u2019, But Will It HURT His Career?\"", "Although the article's title used the phrase \"came out of the closet\", which is commonly used to refer to individuals deciding not to conceal the fact that they are gay and subsequently informing their friends, family, and potentially the public about their sexual preference, no such personal admission was included in the text.", "The Conservative Post was evidently using a more generic interpretation of the term \"out of the closet\" in its headline, in this case referring to somebody who has revealed a personal secret. What was his secret? The web site heavily implied that McConaughey's big reveal is that he identifies as a Christian:", "Actor Matthew McConaughey speaks out in a recent interview with GQ discussing his views on marriage.", "McConaughey is well known for his southern charm, remarkable acting skills, and his recent address at the Oscars where he thanked God and said that his blessings in his life have come from the Almighty.", "However, even this interpretation is misleading at best. In order for McConaughey to \"come out of the closet\" about his religion, it would have required the actor to have been keeping his religion a secret. This \"recent interview\" with GQ was far from the first time McConaughey has talked about his faith.", "In 2001, he told interviewers that he was raised \"Methodist, not southern Baptist\", in 2008, the actor told People Magazine that he named his son Levi after a Biblical character, and when the actor won the Best Actor award at the 2014 Academy Awards he thanked God:", "First off, I want to thank God, because that\u2019s who I look up to. He has graced my life with opportunities that I know are not of my hand or of any other human hand. He has shown me that \u2026 it\u2019s a scientific fact that gratitude reciprocates. In the words of the late Charlie Laughton who said, \u201cWhen you\u2019ve got God you\u2019ve got a friend \u2014 and that friend is you.\u201d", "In fact, this \"recent interview\" to which the Conservative Post refers was actually published in 2014.", "People Magazine. \u00a0 \"Matthew McConaughey and Camila Alves welcome son Levi.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 8 July 2008.", "Martin, Brett. \u00a0 \"Just Keep McConaugheying.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 GQ. \u00a0 20 October 2014.", "NZ Herald. \"No use putting out the welcome Matt.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 11 May 2001.", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
