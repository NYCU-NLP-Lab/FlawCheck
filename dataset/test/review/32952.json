["Republican State Senators Thomas Croci and Sue Serino want to close a loophole that allows level one sex offenders to drive for ride-hailing companies (Getty images)", "When ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft start in upstate New York in July, will registered sex offenders be allowed behind the wheel?", "Republicans in the State Senate have introduced a bill that would prohibit all sex offenders from driving for the ride-hailing companies.", "State Sen. Thomas D. Croci, R-Long Island, said that when lawmakers passed legislation this year allowing the companies to operate upstate, they left a loophole allowing some who are on New York's Sex Offender Registry to drive for the companies. Lower-level sex offenders can become drivers seven years after their prison release", "\"Allowing anyone who appears on the New York State Sex Offender Registry to be drivers for ride-share companies presents an unacceptable risk to our citizens,\" Croci said in a statement.", "Is Croci right? Can some sex offenders drive for Uber and Lyft?", "What\u2019s in the law?", "Lawmakers in April added a new section to the state Vehicle and Traffic Law allowing ride-hailing companies to operate outside of New York City.", "The legislation outlines who can drive for those companies and what type of auto insurance they must carry.", "The law requires ride-hailing companies to perform a background check on prospective drivers. They have to check New York\u2019s Sex Offender Registry and the National Sex Offender Public Registry.", "Those who are on the national registry are barred from ever driving for ride-hailing companies.

Level 1 offenders must wait seven years after their release from jail or prison before they are allowed to drive. If the offenders are not incarcerated, the seven-year waiting period starts when they are convicted, according to state law.", "It is not just sex offenders who can eventually drive for ride-hailing companies.Several other crimes have a waiting period to drive for Uber or Lyft, according to the law.

A misdemeanor offense of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or drugs has a three-year waiting period.", "Our ruling", "Croci, a state senator from Long Island, said that in\u00a0some cases a sex offender \"who appears on the New York State Sex Offender Registry\" would be able to drive for Uber or Lyft.", "Level 1 sex offenders are not listed on the national sex offender registry, and would therefore be allowed to drive for ride-hailing companies seven years after they are released from prison or, if they were not incarcerated, after their conviction.", "Croci\u2019s statement is True.", "Press release from State Sen.
