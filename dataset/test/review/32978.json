["By Eugene Kiely", "Posted on September 20, 2018", "President Donald Trump on several occasions has taken credit for making Medicare \u201cstronger.\u201d In one instance, he said, \u201cMedicare will be $700 billion stronger over the next decade thanks to our growth.\u201d", "In fact, Medicare\u2019s finances have worsened since he took office, and economic growth is not expected to help the program as much as he claims:", "Trump made claims about strengthening Medicare \u2014 the health insurance program for senior citizens and the disabled \u2014 several times over the course of three days in early September.", "In remarks at the White House on Sept. 5, Trump boasted that \u201cwe have done more as an administration than any other administration in already less than two years,\u201d including on health care. \u201cWe\u2019re saving Medicare,\u201d he said.", "A day later, while campaigning in Montana for Republican Senate candidate Matt Rosendale, Trump said, \u201cMatt Rosendale is going to make sure we\u2019re not touching your Social Security and your Medicare is only going one way. That\u2019s stronger.\u201d", "On Sept. 7, the president made the specific claim about the impact of economic growth on Medicare. His remarks came at a fundraiser for GOP Rep. Kristi Noem, who is running for governor of South Dakota against Democrat\u00a0Billie Sutton. The winner will replace outgoing Republican\u00a0Gov.\u00a0Dennis Daugaard.", "Trump, Sept. 7:\u00a0Medicare will be $700 billion stronger over the next decade thanks to our growth. And I will tell you that Billie Sutton, and people like Billie Sutton, Democrats with a very strong liberal leaning, they\u2019re going to destroy your Medicare and they\u2019re going to destroy your Social Security. I\u2019m leaving your social \u2014 it\u2019s going to be left alone, your Social Security will be left alone. We\u2019re not touching your Social [Security], we\u2019re just going to make it stronger. We\u2019re going to make the country stronger. We pay for things through growth. The way we\u2019re growing right now will be able to pay for things that nobody thought possible. Remember during debates they\u2019d say, \u201cHow are you going to do it?\u201d I said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to do it through growth.\u201d", "Medicare and budget experts we contacted said Medicare\u2019s financial outlook has worsened and economic growth is not expected to provide much help.", "\u201cIf anything, some of the administration\u2019s actions appear to be working in the opposite direction, at least as measured by the status of the Medicare Part A trust fund,\u201d\u00a0Juliette Cubanski, associate director of the Kaiser Family Foundation\u2019s Program on Medicare Policy, told us in an email.", "Cubanski is referring to the Medicare trustees\u2019 most recent annual report, which provides an updated projection on the financial status of the Hospital Insurance, or HI, trust fund.", "Medicare is made up of four parts:\u00a0Part A (payments to hospitals), Part B (payments to physicians), Part C (Medicare Advantage, or private insurance options) and Part D (prescription drug coverage). Those parts are funded by two funds:\u00a0the Hospital Insurance (HI) trust fund, which is funded primarily by a payroll tax paid by workers and their employers, and the Supplementary Medical Insurance (SMI) trust fund, which is funded primarily through general revenue and beneficiary premiums.", "The Medicare Part A trust fund is designed to be self-supporting, but the trustee report warns that the financial outlook for the fund \u201chas deteriorated as compared to the projections in last year\u2019s annual report.\u201d", "The HI fund spent more on hospital payments than it received in income from 2008 through 2015, the report said. Although the fund had a slight surplus in 2016 and 2017 and a balance of about $200 billion prior to 2017, the trustees say deficit spending will return this year and accelerate in the coming decade, exhausting the fund earlier than expected.", "\u201cThe estimated depletion date for the HI trust fund is 2026, 3 years earlier than in last year\u2019s report,\u201d the report said. At that point, Medicare would be able to pay only 91 percent of hospital expenses, as the table on page 29 shows. (The SMI trust fund, because of how it is structured, cannot be depleted.)", "The trustees, in part, cited the tax cut law as a reason the HI fund is expected to run out of money more rapidly than previously expected.", "The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 that Trump signed in December repealed the so-called individual mandate in the Affordable Care Act, which requires people to have health insurance or pay a penalty. The repeal, which is effective in 2019, is expected to increase the number of uninsured Americans and that, in turn, will increase\u00a0Medicare Disproportionate Share payments made to hospitals that serve large populations of low-income people without insurance.", "\u201c[T]he percentage of people without health insurance is expected to increase. Because the change in this percentage is a factor used in determining payments to Medicare disproportionate share hospitals for uncompensated care, these payments are expected to increase as well,\u201d the trustees\u2019 report said.", "Also, about 8 percent of HI trust fund revenues come from a federal income tax on Social Security benefits.\u00a0But the tax cut law reduced the federal income tax rates,\u00a0meaning a portion of Social Security benefits will be taxed at a lower rate and generate less income for Medicare, as explained in a July report by the Congressional Research Service on Medicare\u2019s finances.", "\u201cA stronger economy is definitely one of the factors that could help to shore up the status of the Medicare Part A trust fund, since the majority of funding for that comes from payroll taxes,\u201d Cubanski, of the Kaiser Family Foundation, said. \u201cBut all of the factors that affect Medicare financing would have to be going in a positive direction, whereas the administration has taken other steps that have actually made Medicare\u2019s funding situation worse.\u201d", "As we said, Medicare Part A is just one part of the program for seniors and the disabled. In total, Medicare cost $710 billion in 2017 and about 41 percent of that was paid through general revenues (see Table II.B1). Total Medicare expenditures will more than double to about $1.44 trillion by 2027, as illustrated by the CRS chart below, and the share of general revenues will increase to 49 percent by 2032, the trustees report said.", "Separately, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, which Trump signed in February, will have a negative impact on all parts of Medicare, the trustees\u2019 report said.", "That law, among other things, repealed the\u00a0Independent Payment Advisory Board, a 15-member board created by the Affordable Care Act to reduce Medicare costs. As designed, the board\u00a0would make recommendations for cutting spending that could only be overridden with a three-fifths majority of both houses of Congress, or Congress could institute its own reductions of an equal amount recommended by the IPAB.\u00a0(The IPAB had not yet been formed.)", "\u201cThe expenditures in this year\u2019s report are higher than last year\u2019s mostly due to (i) the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, which eliminated the Independent Payment Advisory Board and removed payment caps for certain therapy services, and (ii) higher projected Medicare Advantage (MA) payments attributable to higher risk scores for beneficiaries enrolled in MA plans,\u201d the report said.\u00a0(Risk scores are estimates of the cost of care for beneficiaries.)", "As for Trump\u2019s claim that \u201cMedicare will be $700 billion stronger over the next decade thanks to our growth,\u201d the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget and Cubanski, of the Kaiser Family Foundation, were not aware of any economic projections that would improve Medicare\u2019s finances by that amount.", "The CRFB referred us to Table A-1 of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office\u2019s April 2018 Budget and Economic Outlook, which projects the impact of economic revisions since June 2017 \u2014 including effects of newly enacted legislation and updated economic data. The CBO projected that the economic changes will result in an additional $92 billion in all\u00a0payroll tax revenues, which includes Medicare and Society Security, over 10 years.", "More than half of the additional economic growth was the result of recently enacted legislation, specifically the 2017 tax act, the 2018 budget act and the fiscal year 2018 appropriations law, the CBO report explained. \u201cUpdated data for key measures from the national income and product accounts (NIPAs) also led to economic revisions. (The NIPAs, which are produced by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, track components of the nation\u2019s economic output and income that CBO uses in its economic analyses,)\u201d CBO said.", "So why did the president say Medicare will be $700 billion stronger over 10 years because of economic growth?", "The White House told us that the president was referring to Medicare and Social Security, not just Medicare. It said the administration\u2019s policies will result in \u201cextra economic growth that is on track to add more than $700 billion to Medicare and Social Security revenues.\u201d", "More precisely, the White House estimates that economic growth will generate an additional\u00a0$858 billion more in\u00a0payroll taxes over 11 years, from 2018 to 2028, compared with CBO projections.", "The White House took the administration\u2019s nominal gross domestic product projections for each year from 2018 to 2028 (Table 1 of the White House\u2019s Mid-Session Review of its fiscal 2019 budget proposal) and applied the CBO\u2019s payroll tax revenue as a share of GDP for each year (Table 4-1\u00a0of CBO\u2019s Budget and Economic Outlook) to estimate total payroll tax revenues for those 11 years. It then subtracted CBO\u2019s payroll tax revenue projections from its own and got $858 billion in additional payroll tax revenue due to growth from 2018 to 2028.", "But there are three problems with that logic, beginning with the fact that it doesn\u2019t support what the president said.", "First, the president said he strengthened Medicare by $700 billion over 10 years, but the White House gave us the impact of economic growth on all payroll revenues \u2014 including Social Security, which is the largest.", "We found that the White House (see Table S-4) estimates $129 billion more in Medicare tax revenue than CBO (see tab 4).", "So, Trump is wrong about the impact of economic growth on Medicare even by his administration\u2019s own numbers.", "Second, the White House projects higher payroll tax revenues based on sustained economic growth through 2028. It projects real GDP will grow at an average annual rate of nearly 3 percent for the next decade \u2014 which is about a percentage point higher than most economic forecasters predict.", "In August, CBO projected\u00a0real GDP will grow 3.1 percent this year and 2.4 percent next year, but over the 10-year budget period, from 2018 to 2028, CBO projects an average annual growth rate of 1.9 percent.", "The consensus among economic forecasters is that tax cuts and increased federal spending will stimulate the economy, but only in the short term, according to the CRFB.", "For example, the most recent median forecast of the\u00a0Federal Reserve Board\u00a0members and Federal Reserve Bank presidents, released June 13, is for 2.8 percent in 2018, 2.4 percent in 2019 and 2.0 percent in 2020. But the \u201clonger-run\u201d median forecast is 1.8 percent.", "Third, although Trump says \u201cwe pay for things through growth,\u201d the additional payroll tax revenue generated by economic growth \u2014 even at the level projected by the White House \u2014 is a small fraction of the cost of Social Security and Medicare.", "The administration\u2019s proposed budget for mandatory programs (Table S-4) shows that it expects to spend $8.75 trillion on Medicare from 2019 to 2028, but take in only $3.6 trillion in Medicare payroll taxes.\u00a0As for Social Security, the administration expects to spend $13.66 trillion and take in only $11.6 trillion.", "Budget experts say mandatory programs remain on track to consume an increasingly greater share of federal spending.", "In its April report, CBO estimated that \u201cspending for people age 65 or older in several large mandatory programs \u2014 Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and military and federal civilian retirement programs\u201d \u2014 will increase from 38 percent of federal spending in 2018 to 45 percent in 2028. (That does not include federal spending on interest.)", "Marc Goldwein, senior policy director at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, told us in an email: \u201cThere has been no major Social Security or Medicare legislation enacted, so the programs are essentially on the same path they were on before the President took office.\u201d", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
