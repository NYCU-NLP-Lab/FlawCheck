["By Lori Robertson", "Posted on June 8, 2020", "The national semantics exercise over \u201cpepper balls\u201d and \u201ctear gas\u201d has continued.", "On CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d Attorney General William Barr was asked if it was appropriate for the U.S. Park Police \u201cto use smoke bombs, tear gas, pepper balls, projectiles at what appeared to be peaceful protesters\u201d outside the White House on June 1. Barr\u00a0objected to the description of \u201cpepper spray\u201d as a \u201cchemical irritant,\u201d saying, \u201cIt\u2019s not chemical.\u201d", "But Barr is contradicted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as well as the Department of Justice, as Dr. Ranit Mishori, senior medical adviser for Physicians for Human Rights and a Georgetown University professor of family medicine, told us.", "\u201cBarr should know better and perhaps brush up on his high school chemistry lessons,\u201d Mishori said. \u201cPepper spray is a chemical irritant. Period. The CDC classifies it as a chemical irritant, as does his own Department of Justice.\u201d", "On its website, the CDC says pepper spray is a \u201criot control agent,\u201d and such agents \u201c(sometimes referred to as \u2018tear gas\u2019) are chemical compounds that temporarily make people unable to function by causing irritation to the eyes, mouth, throat, lungs, and skin.\u201d Mishori referred us to a 2009 DOJ Office of Inspector General report on \u201cless-lethal weapons\u201d that describes pepper spray, and the brand name PepperBall system, as \u201cchemical agents.\u201d (It\u2019s worth noting the report also lists \u201cCS Gas (Tear Gas)\u201d in that category.)", "As we\u2019ve written, President Donald Trump objected to media descriptions of the use of \u201ctear gas\u201d to disperse protesters near the White House before the president walked to St. John\u2019s Episcopal Church to pose for photos with a Bible. The U.S. Park Police acting chief said in a statement, \u201cNo tear gas was used by USPP officers or other assisting law enforcement partners\u201d that night, but said \u201csmoke canisters and pepper balls\u201d were used. Pepper balls contain a pepper spray-like irritant.", "We found some sources \u2014 including the Scientific American \u2014 consider pepper spray a type of tear gas, while others say both chemicals have the same effect on people.", "Mishori, of Physicians for Human Rights, told us in an email: \u201cTear gas and pepper spray both belong to a class of crowd-control weapons known as chemical irritants.\u201d The chemical makeup is different, but the impact on people is similar. \u201cDuring a protest, it is impossible to tell what chemical is being used as the clinical manifestations are the same.\u201d", "Here\u2019s Physicians for Human Rights\u2019 fact sheet on \u201cchemical irritants.\u201d", "Pepper sprays \u201care mostly derived from capsaicin, the spice compound in chili peppers,\u201d the Scientific American explained in 2018. \u201cThere are two compounds in common use in this category: OC gas, a concentrated solution of natural capsaicin, and PAVA, a mix of synthetic capsaicin.\u201d OC is the abbreviation for Oleoresin Capsicum.", "After we wrote our story, \u201cThe Semantics of \u2018Tear Gas\u2019 versus \u2018Pepper Spray,\u2019\u201d Sgt. Eduardo Delgado, a U.S. Park Police spokesman, told the press it was a \u201cmistake\u201d or an \u201cincorrect term\u201d to say its officers didn\u2019t use \u201ctear gas\u201d on protesters outside the White House on June 1.", "Delgado distinguished pepper spray (or pepper balls) from CS, chlorobenzalmalononitrile, and CN, chloroacetophenone, both typically referred to as \u201ctear gas.\u201d CS and CN activate a certain pain receptor, while pepper sprays, or OC, activate another. Both categories of irritants cause pain and burning to mucous membranes, causing tearing, coughing and other irritations.", "Delgado told Vox and Business Insider that USPP should have been more specific in its statement.", "\u201cWe should have said we did not use CS or CN,\u201d Delgado told Business Insider.", "\u201cIt was kind of a fault on our part just not saying in the first place \u2018we did not use CN or CS, we used smoke and pepper balls,\u2019 and that would\u2019ve made it a moot point,\u201d Delgado told Vox. \u201cSome people claim we purposefully tried to mislead by saying \u2018we didn\u2019t use tear gas, we used pepper balls.\u2019 \u2026 That was not our intention.\u201d", "He further said of pepper balls: \u201cI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s not a tear gas, but I\u2019m just saying we use a pepper ball that shoots a powder.\u201d", "USPP Acting Chief Gregory T. Monahan, however, issued another statement on June 5, reiterating that USPP \u201cdid not use tear gas.\u201d", "Trump has left the false impression that law enforcement didn\u2019t use any chemical agent by saying police \u201cdidn\u2019t use tear gas,\u201d without mentioning the pepper balls.", "Barr has now drawn a fine distinction on how one might define \u201cpepper spray.\u201d In the June 7 airing of \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d he claimed \u201cthere was no tear gas used,\u201d but also that \u201cpepper spray\u201d wasn\u2019t \u201ca chemical irritant.\u201d", "Barr, June 7: By the way, there was no tear gas used. The tear gas was used Sunday when they had to clear H Street to allow the fire department to come in to save St. John\u2019s Church. That\u2019s when tear gas was used.", "\u201cFace the Nation\u201d host Margaret Brennan: There were chemical irritants the Park Police has said\u2013", "Barr: No, they were not chemical irritants. Pepper spray is not a chemical irritant. It\u2019s not chemical.", "Brennan: Pepper spray, you\u2019re saying is what was used\u2013", "Barr: Pepper balls. Pepper balls.", "We don\u2019t know the exact ingredients in USPP\u2019s pepper balls, or the brand. We asked, but Delgado only said the ones USPP uses \u201ccontain a powder.\u201d An expert quoted in the Scientific American article, however, said tear \u201cgases\u201d are technically powders that look like a mist in the air.", "The PepperBall company says its projectiles contain \u201cthe most effective chemical irritant available.\u201d Even if pepper balls contain natural, as opposed to the synthetic, capsaicin, medical sources describe the substance as \u201cchemical.\u201d A 2009 article in the journal U.S. Pharmacist, for example, calls capsaicin, and pepper spray, \u201ca chemical compound.\u201d", "\u201cMany pepper sprays use a naturally-produced chemical \u2014 made of capsaicin, the same ingredient as in chili peppers \u2013\u00a0 but it is still a chemical,\u201d Mishori said.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
