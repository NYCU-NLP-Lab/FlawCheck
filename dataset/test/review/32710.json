["About this rating", "The 2017-2018 flu season is proving to be among the worst in recent history, in part because this year's flu shot offers little protection against the most virulent strain \u2014 H3N2. The strength of this year\u2019s epidemic has also lead to an increase in influenza-based fear-mongering, generally about the drugs or vaccines used to combat the virus. One target of online fear is the antiviral drug Tamiflu, prescribed to reduce the length of illness, or in some cases as a preventative measure.", "A well-shared 14 February 2018 Facebook post took this to an extreme when it blamed the reportedly increased deaths not on the influenza itself but the drug Tamiflu:", "So it isn't the flu that is causing the deaths.. Maybe it's the tamiflu... It says so on the insert... It can lead you to death.. Yikes.. DO NOT TAKE THE TAMIFLU.. The doctor at our local hospital wouldn't even prescribe Tamiflu when we took our daughter because of the side effects and risk.", "In support of this claim, the user posted a excerpt of the medication\u2019s safety insert about \u201cchange in behavior,\u201d using a white line to highlight the word \u201cdeath\u201d:", "People, especially children, who have the flu can develop nervous system problems and abnormal behavior that can lead to death.", "During treatment with Tamiflu, tell your healthcare provider right away if you or your child have confusion, speech problems, shaky movements, seizure, or start hearing voices or seeing things that are not really there (hallucinations).", "The existence of this warning is factual (though not especially unique, as many drug inserts list death as a rare side effect), but research supporting this connection is controversial. Change in behavior is indeed a class of side effects linked to Tamiflu, and it is one that has been also been linked in rare cases to deaths. However, those deaths mainly resulted from dangerous or self destructive behavior, easily distinguishable from deaths caused by flu symptoms. Our article on a viral Facebook post about a child\u2019s possible terrifying reaction to Tamiflu goes into more detail about these side effects.", "However, to suggest that Tamiflu is responsible for the increased number of deaths is at best illogical, as the symptoms that would accompany the behavioral changes (hallucinations, seizures, speech problems) would be obvious even to the most untrained medical professional.", "It is also unsupported by any credible evidence \u2014 a majority of influenza deaths this year are due to higher than usual rates of pneumonia, a condition characterized by fluid in the lungs \u2014 which is extremely difficult to confuse with the symptoms listed above or behavioral aberrations.", "While Tamiflu does list some scary side effects in its insert, these side effects are both rare and irrelevant to the increased number of influenza deaths this year.", "Painter, Kim. \u00a0 \u201cThis Flu Season Is the Worst in Nearly a Decade \u2014 And It's Not Getting Better.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 USA Today. \u00a0 9 February 2018.", "Jefferson, T., et al. \u00a0 \u201cNeuraminidase Inhibitors for Preventing and Treating Influenza in Healthy Adults and Children.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews.. \u00a0 April 2014.", "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \u00a0 \"2017-2018 Influenza Season Week 5 ending February 3, 2018.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Accessed 14 February 2018.", "Bloomberg. \u00a0 \"The Flu is Killing Up to 4,000 Americans a Week.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Accessed 10 February 2018.", "Nishiyama, George. \u00a0 \u201cTamiflu Side Effect Concerns Grow After Japan Deaths.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Reuters\u00a0 6 March 2007.", "Correction [15 February 2018]: A previous version of this article misstated the name of the H3N2 influenza strain.", "Alex Kasprak is an investigative journalist and science writer reporting on scientific misinformation, online fraud, and financial crime.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
