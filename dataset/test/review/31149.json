Bush\u2019s 2007 State of the Union speech, and he said he found the similarities between the two speeches a bit eerie.", "\"There were lines like, \u2018Our job is to help Americans build a future of hope and opportunity,\" Thiessen told Fox News\u2019 Megyn Kelly. \"\u2018A future of hope and opportunity requires that all citizens have affordable and available health care, extending opportunity and hope depends on a stable supply of energy.\u2019 All of that came from the 2007 State of the Union from George W.

No,\" Thiessen told us. \"But Obama clearly lifted the repeating theme of his address from Bush's 2007 State of the Union. In Obama's case, it's significant because he is abandoning a liberal theme that was not working (income inequality) in favor of a conservative theme that does (opportunity).\"", "Thiessen said this wasn\u2019t the first time he felt Obama borrowed heavily from Bush. He said it happened before in an Obama speech on Syria.", "In this case, Thiessen does well to back away from the zinger he delivered on television.

The idea of opportunity belongs to both political parties, but it\u2019s a word more typically used by Republicans, both Thiessen and Bailey said.", "\"Much of the language in Obama\u2019s speech took a more conservative tone, using words and terminology commonly associated with Republicans,\" Bailey said.", "That said, not everyone agrees that Obama took much of a conservative turn in his speech. According to an analysis from political scientists Benjamin Lauderdale at the London School of Economics and John Sides at George Washington University, Obama\u2019s tone was not much different than it had been in previous years.", "For fun, we used the website Wordle to generate diagrams showing how many times the two presidents used certain words in their speeches.
