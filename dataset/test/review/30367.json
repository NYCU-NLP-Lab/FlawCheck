["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on November 18, 2020", "A report from two dozen experts \u2014 including a doctor named to President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s COVID-19 advisory board \u2014 recommended using existing social service programs to connect people with COVID-19 vaccine distribution. The report did not advise requiring vaccination in order to receive such services, as social media posts falsely claim.", "When a COVID-19 vaccine is approved and ready, health officials will need to coordinate its distribution to hundreds of millions of people and help the public overcome misperceptions.", "Dubious websites and social media posts, however, are spreading a falsehood about a report outlining distribution strategies, wrongly accusing a member of President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s COVID-19 advisory team of wanting to mandate vaccination by tying it to food assistance.", "On Instagram, users shared screenshots of a Nov. 12 headline from the website Natural News, falsely claiming, \u201cVAX THE BLACKS: Joe Biden\u2019s Covid-19 taskforce member recommends withholding food stamps and rent assistance from those who refuse coronavirus vaccines.\u201d", "Natural News was banned by Facebook earlier this year for using foreign trolls to spread its unreliable content.", "The vaccine story, which also appeared on an affiliated website called Distributed News, specifically says that Dr. Luciana Borio, recently named a member of Biden\u2019s Transition COVID-19 Advisory Board, \u201csays that people who refuse to be vaccinated should be deprived of food stamps and rent assistance.\u201d", "That is false.", "The story offers a distorted take on one part of a July report published by the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security \u2014 \u201cThe Public\u2019s Role in COVID-19 Vaccination: Planning Recommendations Informed by Design Thinking and the Social, Behavioral, and Communication Sciences.\u201d The report was the result of a working group of about two dozen experts, including Borio.", "The report did not recommend that vaccine \u201cmandates\u201d be tied to social service programs, such as food stamps and rent assistance, as the Natural News story claims.", "Instead, one of the report\u2019s recommendations is to \u201cMake Vaccination Available in Safe, Familiar, and Convenient Places.\u201d The report explains that making vaccines widely available will \u201centail local and state health departments\u2019 developing vaccination capacity, creating local adaptations to meet communities \u2014 and, particularly, vulnerable populations \u2014 where they are, and communicating timely information in clear and accessible ways.\u201d", "One corresponding action item says this:", "Local and state public health agencies should explore collaboration with interagency and nongovernment partners to bundle vaccination with other safety net services. For example, the WIC nutrition program serves as a key mechanism for connecting low-income pregnant women with nutrition supports and clinical services, and immunization screenings and vaccine promotion are built into the WIC program. Bundling services (eg, food security, rent assistance, free clinic services) that are already being provided to particularly vulnerable populations in the context of COVID (eg, older adults, low-income adults, Black and minority communities) could be a way to build trust and streamline vaccine provision. Early, rapid-response, community-based research (Recommendation #4) can help broaden planners\u2019 understanding of how the intended beneficiaries of vaccines think about where these products fit into their lives overall, based on their own definitions of health and well-being.", "In a statement provided to us in response to the viral story, Dr. Monica Schoch-Spana and Emily K. Brunson, the lead authors of the Johns Hopkins report, said that they \u201cdo NOT advocate that such social supports ever be withheld in connection with an individual\u2019s vaccination status.\u201d", "The statement said the viral story contained \u201cfactual inaccuracies and misleading statements\u201d about the report\u2019s recommendations, and that the authors \u201ctake exception to the singling out and professional misrepresentation\u201d of Borio.", "\u201cWe support\u00a0voluntary\u00a0vaccination during the pandemic, once safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccines become available. We argue that SARS-CoV-2 vaccines should NOT be mandated,\u201d the statement added. \u201cWe do advocate the provision of timely, accurate, and meaningful information so that individuals can make well-informed decisions about whether or not to accept vaccination for themselves or dependents in their care.\u201d", "Schoch-Spana and Brunson further said they \u201csupport efforts to make SARS-CoV-2 vaccines readily available to everyone who wants one, including individuals with limited means.\u201d One way to do that is to provide the vaccines \u201cat places where these individuals already go such as WIC clinics and food banks,\u201d they said.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
