["Since landing on Mars on Feb. 18, NASA\u2019s Perseverance rover has beamed images from the planet back to Earth. But one that\u2019s recently been circulating on Facebook isn\u2019t one of them.", "The image shows a red, rocky surface and three glowing orbs in the sky that resemble Orion\u2019s Belt.", "\"Earth, Venus and Jupiter as seen from Mars,\" one post sharing the image says.", "This post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)", "Ralf Gellert, a physics professor at the University of Guelph in Canada who helped develop equipment for NASA\u2019s Mars rovers, pointed us to the first image ever taken of Earth from the surface of Mars.", "The black-and-white photo was taken in 2004, and doesn\u2019t look nearly as crisp as the image in the Facebook post, which Gellert said \"sure looks fake.\"", "A more recent photo, taken by the Curiosity Mars rover, shows Earth and Venus in June 2020. It also bears little resemblance to the Facebook photo.", "Searching for images, videos and audio that included Mars, Earth, Venus and Jupiter on NASA\u2019s website, we found 15 results, but none like the image in the post.", "A NASA spokesman told PolitiFact that the image is not from the agency.", "Edwin Kite, a geophysical sciences professor at the University of Chicago who studies Mars, told us that it\u2019s not even a real image. Rather, he said it looks like a simulated image.", "\"Mars rovers have imaged Earth and Venus in the past,\" he said, and they \"also sometimes image Mars\u2019 moons, Phobos and Deimos.\"", "The image in the Facebook post has been online since at least 2012, when Discover magazine wrote about what it called \"an unreal Mars skyline.\"", "The writer, Phil Plait, said in the story that he knew right away \"it wasn\u2019t legit.\"", "\"The landscape color is a bit too saturated for Mars,\" he said. \"The sky\u2019s the wrong color. The clouds are too numerous, the wrong color as well, and they have that \u2018rendered software\u2019 look to them.\"", "That hunch proved out: He noticed the letters NE in the bottom left corner of the image \u2014\u00a0barely visible in the Facebook post \u2014\u00a0and noted that they\u2019re the kind of markers used in planetarium software to indicate which direction a user is looking.", "The picture isn\u2019t a hoax, he said, \"just a computer generated image probably meant to represent a real scene.\"", "Had such a photo been taken, it would have appeared widely in the media as the previous NASA photos of Earth from Mars were.", "There\u2019s no such coverage of this image.", "We rate the post False.", "Facebook post, Feb. 21, 2021", "Business Insider, Stunning photos from NASA\u2019s new Mars rover reveal 200-foot cliffs, mysterious rocks, and the perfect touchdown, Feb. 23, 2021", "NASA, You are here: Earth as seen from Mars, March 11, 2004", "NASA, While stargazing on Mars, NASA\u2019s Curiosity rover spots Earth and Venus, Feb. 24, 2021", "Discover, An unreal Mars skyline, Aug. 10, 2012", "Email interview with Ralf Gellert, associate professor, University of Guelph, Feb. 24, 2021", "Email interview with Edwin Kite, assistant professor, University of Chicago, Feb. 24, 2021", "Email interview with Sean Potter, media relations specialist, NASA, Feb. 24, 2021", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
