["A 25-year-old New Zealand politician recently dismissed a senior lawmaker who interrupted her speech on climate change with two words: \"OK boomer.\"", "The retort to older people who just don\u2019t get it has gone mainstream, but don\u2019t be fooled into thinking former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush said it to his one-time political rival.", "An image shared on Facebook on Nov. 4 appears to show Bush tweeting \"Ok boomer\" in response to Trump\u2019s tweet characterizing the impeachment inquiry as a \"Scam and Witch Hunt.\"", "This post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)", "Yes, Bush is only 66 to Trump\u2019s 73, but reviewing his Twitter feed on Oct. 9 we found no such tweet. Rather, he responded to a tweet from Michael Morrell, the former acting and deputy director of the CIA. Morrell said: \"The Turkish military is about to move into Syria. President Trump allowed this to happen. An ethnic cleansing of our Kurdish allies, a boost to ISIS, and a foreign policy gift to Russia, Iran, & China will be the result. America\u2019s standing in the world will take an immense hit.\"", "Bush retweeted Morrell and wrote, \"This is a tragedy.\"", "He also retweeted New York Times columnist Ross Douthat, an Illinois congressman, and U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham.", "Searching on Twitchy, which keeps tabs on high-profile people who delete their tweets, we didn\u2019t find evidence that Bush tweeted and then deleted. We also didn\u2019t find any evidence searching for echoes of the tweet more broadly online. Finally, we searched the Nexis news archive for \"Jeb Bush\" and \"Donald Trump\" and \"Ok boomer\" and got no matches. If a lawmaker in New Zealand unknown to many Americans can draw U.S. media attention for saying \"OK boomer,\" we expect Jeb Bush would as well.", "Please clap: We rate this Facebook post False.", "Facebook post, Nov. 4, 2019", "BBC, \u2018OK boomer\u2019: 25-year-old New Zealand MP uses term in parliament, Nov. 7, 2019", "The New York Times, \u2018OK Boomer\u2019 marks the end of friendly generational relations, Oct. 29, 2019", "Britannica, Jeb Bush, visited Nov. 7, 2019", "Business Insider, 45 photos of Donald Trump\u2019s incomparable life on his 73rd birthday, June 14, 2019", "Donald Trump tweet, Oct. 9, 2019", "Michael Morrell tweet, Oct. 9, 2019", "Jeb Bush tweet, Oct. 9, 2019", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
