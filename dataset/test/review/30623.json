However, no one from Trump\u2019s office has shown evidence of \"serious voter fraud\" in California.", "Trump may be drawing on an unsupported claim that 3 million \"illegal aliens\" cast votes in this year\u2019s election. That allegation was made on Twitter by Gregg Phillips, who has worked for the Republican Party and has a voter fraud reporting app.", "PolitiFact reported that Phillips has not released any corroborating evidence and noted that public information undermines his statement. It rated his claim False.", "On Nov. 8 in California, there were reports of election glitches, such as the wrong names being placed on some absentee ballots and long lines at some polling places.", "But state and local election officials, along with independent observers, say there have been no reports of widespread voter fraud in the state.", "\"His allegations are completely unfounded,\" California Secretary of State Alex Padilla said in an interview. \"I think it\u2019s a big disservice to our country and to our democracy to continue to raise these doubts. If anything, a message back to Mr. Trump is, if you have proof, if you have evidence, please bring it forward. Procedures are in place to investigate any real voter fraud.
