["As President Donald Trump continues to demand an early call of a winner on election night, a new Facebook post making the rounds suggests he got his wish \u2014 at least in Wisconsin.", "One\u00a0Sept. 28\u00a0Facebook post reads: \u201cA federal judge just ordered Wisconsin must have all ballots counted by 8 p.m. on the day of the election.\"", "In the comments on one version of the post, many offer thanks for sharing the information. Some call for the same order to be given for other states.", "One problem: The post is completely fictitious.", "In fact, a ruling from a federal judge \u2014\u00a0upheld by an appeals panel \u2014\u00a0actually does the opposite. It extends the period for which absentee ballots can be counted by nearly a week.", "Let's clarify what it got wrong.", "The first problem is that results have never been tallied by 8 p.m. on Election Day.", "That\u2019s when polls close.", "And, by state law, anyone in line by 8 p.m. is entitled to vote. That alone might take hours in a high turnout election. So, as a practical matter, there is no way to count all of the votes by 8 p.m.", "Fact check:2018 empty mail-in ballot envelopes in California dumpster spur false fraud claims", "Even in pre-pandemic election years, when many fewer absentee ballots are involved, it can take hours to run all of the ballots through machines and get final numbers. That\u2019s because Wisconsin is among a few states that do not allow election clerks to begin that process until Election Day.", "Clerks \u2014 Republican and Democrat alike\u00a0\u2014 have long asked for the Legislature to change this. Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson recently called for it as well, but the GOP-controlled Legislature has refused to act.", "The Facebook post says a judge issued this ruling but provides no name.", "That\u2019s because there is no such ruling.", "Historically, state law has held that only absentee ballots received by Election Day can be tabulated. Those that come in later, even if mailed on time, are discarded.", "On Sept. 21, 2020, a federal judge ordered a number of changes to procedures. Notably, for our purposes here, he gave Wisconsin voters more time to get their absentee ballots in. As long as the ballots are postmarked by Nov. 3, they can be accepted and counted by clerks through Nov. 9, nearly one week later.", "The Backstory:How and why the USA TODAY Network fact checks issues, people and statements", "That judge, William Conley, initially put that ruling on hold, so it could be appealed. On Sept 29, a panel of appeals court judges upheld the ruling, putting the extended deadline in place.", "That ruling, which was unanimous, came from a three-judge panel of the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago, all of whom were appointed by Republican presidents.", "The decision was a victory for Democrats, who asked to loosen election rules during the coronavirus pandemic, and a setback for Republicans, who tried to prevent changes to the timeline of Election Day.", "The ruling, which could be appealed again, also gave voters extra time to register to vote, extending the deadline from Oct. 14 to Oct. 21.", "We rate this claim FALSE based on our research. This post\u00a0gets it completely wrong. First, voters in line at 8 p.m. on Election Day can legally cast their vote. No judge made this ruling.\u00a0An earlier ruling from a federal judge \u2014\u00a0since upheld by an appeals panel \u2014\u00a0actually did the opposite, allowing any absentee ballots returned by Nov. 9 to be counted, as long as they were postmarked by Election Day.", "Thank you for supporting our journalism.
