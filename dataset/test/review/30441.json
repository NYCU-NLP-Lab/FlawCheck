["A young man from Uttar Pradesh\u2019s Jewar (Gautam Buddha Nagar district) turned up in New Delhi on Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s death anniversary, January 30. He pulled out a gun amid a crowd of students from Jamia Milia Islamia agitating against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and injured a protester. Soon after, news agency ANI shared a copy of the shooter\u2019s Grade 10 CBSE mark sheet, according to which his date of birth is April 2002. This suggested that he is a minor.", "Subsequent to ANI\u2019s tweet, a counter-claim began floating on social media via a screenshot of a person\u2019s voter information taken from the website of the Election Commission of India (ECI). The name on the screenshot matches the shooter\u2019s name. The state (Uttar Pradesh) and the constituency (Jewar) also match with his residence. The document states his father\u2019s name as \u2018Deepchand Sharma\u2019.", "Among the ones who shared the screenshot was one Dr Azim Khan who wrote that this serves as \u2018proof\u2019 that the shooter is an adult.", "Academic Ashok Swain also claimed that the accused is an adult based on the screenshots.", "However, he later took down his tweet.", "On January 3. Firstpost published a report titled, \u201cJamia shooter\u2019s age row: CBSE certificate shows him as \u2018minor\u2019, EC document shows he\u2019s registered voter since April 2019.\u201d The report states, \u201cWhile several media reports after the 30 January incident confirmed that Sharma was a \u201cminor\u201d, new details based on details fished out of the Election Commission website show that the shooter is not a minor after all. However, verification of these details are still underway.\u201d", "Several users have also shared a screenshot of voter details from the website electoralsearch.in.", "On January 30, TV9 Bharatvarsh published a report on the shooter\u2019s age where the media outlet attached a photocopy of his Aadhaar card. His date of birth on the card \u2013 April 8, 2002 \u2013 matches with the one stated on the CBSE mark sheet (which has also been included in TV9 Bharatvasrh report). However, there is a mismatch in the father\u2019s name. The viral ECI document states the father\u2019s name as \u2018Deepchand Sharma\u2019, which does not match with the shooter\u2019s father\u2019s name reported by TV9 Bharatvarsh.", "The names of the accused\u2019s family members are not revealed in this report to protect the identity of a minor under Indian law.", "Another report by Dainik Bhaskar carries the father\u2019s name which matches with the one reported by TV9 Bharatvarsh.", "A YouTube channel \u2018Janjwar \u091c\u0928\u091c\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0930\u2019 uploaded a ground report from Jewar where the channel spoke with neighbours and family members of the shooter, including his father who introduces himself at 6:35 minutes into the broadcast. The man does not refer to himself as \u2018Deepchand Sharma\u2019. The report also shows the shooter\u2019s CBSE mark sheet where his father\u2019s and mother\u2019s names are visible. The father\u2019s name matches with the one provided by TV9 Bharatvarsh and Dainik Bhaskar.", "For further corroboration, Alt News rummaged through voter data on the ECI website.", "To check an individual\u2019s voter data, one has to provide mandatory details such as his/ her name, father\u2019s or husband\u2019s name, age or date of birth and state. Details about district and assembly constituency are optional but truncate the search results. A search on the ECI website with the accused\u2019s details (both mandatory and optional), as reported in the media, throws no results. This means that there is no registered voter with those details.", "Alt News also scoured the ECI website without providing specific details of district and constituency and only the mandatory details. We found only one voter (highlighted in red below) whose name and father\u2019s name are the same as the shooter\u2019s details. He is 19 years of age however, hails from Saharanpur unlike the shooter who hails from Gautam Buddha Nagar\u2019s Jewar. For the rest, the father\u2019s name was not an exact match as it carried a middle name.", "The screenshot of the voter details viral on social media thus, do not match with the information available about the Jamia shooter, as reported in the media. His father\u2019s name is not Deepchand Sharma, as corroborated via the father\u2019s interview on the YouTube channel \u2018Janjwar \u091c\u0928\u091c\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0930\u2019.", "Donate Now", "Pooja Chaudhuri is a senior editor at Alt News.", "A video showing three women tackling several men who were apparently trying to harass them\u2026", "On November 15, Israeli forces raided the al-Shifa Hospital in the Gaza Strip as part\u2026", "Trigger Warning: Graphic Image Amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas war, a collage of two pictures is\u2026", "A video of a Palestinian woman allegedly saying that she \u2018prefers the Jews\u2019 in Arabic\u2026", "A 13-second clip from Gaza is viral on social media where a seemingly injured man\u2026"]
