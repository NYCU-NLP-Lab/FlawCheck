But Florida legislators show no sign of backing away from it.", "The\u00a0Florida\u00a0House Criminal Justice Subcommittee rejected a repeal of the law during a five-hour meeting Nov. 7, 2013. The hearing was led by Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fort Walton Beach, who had previously vowed not to change \"one damn comma\" of the law.", "At the hearing, supporters and critics lined up to speak about the law. Among the supporters are sheriffs, said Okaloosa County Sheriff Larry Ashley.", "\"Florida sheriffs unequivocally support this, the right to stand your ground,\" said the sheriff from northwest Florida. Ashley said that the \"stand your ground\" law expanded the \"castle doctrine\" -- the right for people to defend themselves at home -- to other places, including their neighborhood and the mall.", "\"Florida sheriffs stand behind this law and oppose the repeal of it,\" said Ashley, who served on the task force formed by Gov. Rick Scott to examine the law after Trayon's death.", "The dictionary defines \"unequivocal\" as \"admitting of no doubt or misunderstanding; clear and unambiguous.\"", "Ashley\u2019s statement could leave listeners with the impression that Florida sheriffs\u2019 have no doubts about the stand your ground law. Is that correct?", "Sheriffs\u00a0association vote on \u2018stand your ground\u2019", "The \"stand your ground\"\u00a0law, which was approved overwhelmingly by the Legislature and signed by Gov.

The \"stand your ground\" law was cited in the jury instructions, and in July 2013, the jury found Zimmerman not guilty of second-degree\u00a0murder. The law became a touchstone in the debate about Trayvon's death.", "About a month after the acquittal, the Florida Sheriffs Association issued a press release\u00a0expressing support for the law.", "\"The right to self-defense is well-established in law,\" stated the Aug. 9 press release. \"The Florida Sheriffs confirmed this position by voting unanimously, at the 2013 Florida Sheriffs Association Summer Conference, to support the 'stand your ground' law as it is currently written. Our current judicial system is comprised of multiple checks and balances to ensure fair and equitable application of all laws, including 'stand your ground.' \"", "Ashley, who participated in the vote, told PolitiFact Florida that none of the sheriffs voiced opposition to the law during the association\u2019s meeting at Marco Island in August.", "\"As with any issue you can only measure support or opposition to a position when it is voiced at the time of its measurement,\" Ashley told PolitiFact Florida in an email.", "But some news reports about the association\u2019s announcement questioned whether it was accurate to describe the vote as \"unanimous.\"", "For starters, it was unclear how many sheriffs voted. The association reported that 57 of its\u00a066 sheriffs registered for the conference, but the association didn\u2019t record the number who participated in the vote -- some may have left before the vote or didn\u2019t participate in it.", "\"It was a large number of sheriffs,\" Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd, the association president, told PolitiFact Florida. \"I can\u2019t tell you if it was 57, 52, 55. It is a well-attended session because that\u2019s where we discuss things among ourselves that are of some importance.\"", "News reports indicated that some sheriffs -- including from large urban counties including Broward, Hillsborough and Orange -- didn\u2019t participate in the vote and that a few sheriffs had some reservations about the law.", "Judd told PolitiFact that there was no written agenda that notified sheriffs ahead of time that they would take a vote on the \"stand your ground\" law. Judd said that sheriffs had heard that House Speaker Will Weatherford wanted input from law enforcement about the law, and that that\u2019s what prompted the vote. Judd couldn\u2019t recall for certain if he was the sheriff who brought up the topic, but he added that it might have been him. (Judd was elevated to the group\u2019s presidency during the conference.)", "There was no written motion about the vote, but Judd said the wording was essentially: \"Do you support Florida\u2019s 'stand your ground' law?\"", "\"It was a unanimous vote and there was not a voice in opposition,\" Judd said.", "Judd said he was frustrated that news reports questioned his description of the vote as \"unanimous.\"", "\"Some reporters say \u2018you didn\u2019t have 100 percent of Florida sheriffs.\u2019 You are missing the issue. We had 100 percent vote of the ones in the room that voted. ...

Here\u2019s a summary of our findings:", "Broward County: The Sun-Sentinel reported that Sheriff Scott Israel wasn\u2019t at the Florida Sheriffs Association conference due to National Night Out events in Broward.", "Israel told the Sentinel in August that had he attended, \"I would have voted against the FSA statement on the 'stand your ground' law. I support an individual's right to use armed self-defense when faced with the immediate threat of death or serious bodily injury, and without requiring any duty to retreat in one's own home. However, if there is a safe opportunity in other settings to retreat and de-escalate potentially deadly violence, it should be done. For this reason, I support legislative changes to more narrowly restrict the use of the 'stand your ground' defense.\"", "Israel expressed support for \"fixing serious flaws\" in the law in an October op-ed in the Sun-Sentinel.", "Pinellas County: Sheriff Bob Gualtieri told PolitiFact Florida in an email, \"I was unclear as to exactly what was being asked in the motion,\" at the association meeting. \"I did not verbalize a response when the voice vote was called.\"", "Gualtieri said that he \"unequivocally\" supports the broad concept of the \"stand your ground\" law. However, he said there is room for discussion about some adjustments.", "\"I do not support the application of SYG immunity in circumstances where the person against whom deadly force was used was totally unarmed with any type of weapon when the force was used,\" Gualtieri said. \"I also do not believe that someone deemed to be a 'primary aggressor'\u00a0should be able to assert SYG \u2014 one does not get to pick the fight and then end it with deadly force.\"", "Hillsborough: The Tampa Tribune reported that Sheriff David Gee attended the conference but left before the vote. (We confirmed that directly with a spokeswoman.) He said he \"wouldn't have voted that way without hearing the state attorneys out on that issue.\"", "In July 2012, Gee sent a response to an NRA questionnaire in which he declined to provide his personal opinion about self defense.", "\"The Legislature has spoken on this issue,\" he wrote. \"HCSO deputies always follow the law.\"", "Orange: A spokesman for Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings told PolitiFact Florida that Demings attended the meeting but had to leave early to attend National Night Out events.

As a member of the Citizen Safety and Protection Task Force appointed by Governor Scott last year, I stand by the recommendations of the Task Force.\"", "Volusia and Flagler counties: The News Service of Florida reported that the sheriffs in Volusia and Flagler counties expressed reservations about the law.", "A spokesman for Volusia Sheriff Ben Johnson told PolitiFact Florida in an email that Johnson was in the room for the vote but did not participate in it. Johnson, a past president of the association, stands behind the association\u2019s position on the law, but added that \"his personal position differs slightly from that of the association. The sheriff supports the right of citizens to employ deadly force with no duty to retreat in order to defend themselves while in their homes or vehicles. However, when out in the open and facing a threat, the sheriff believes citizens should attempt to retreat if possible before using lethal force. He has consistently stated this position and supports the law, but believes it would be improved with the addition of three words (retreat if possible) as it relates to locations other than homes or vehicles.\"", "Meanwhile, Flagler County Sheriff Jim Manfre, according to the News Service of Florida, \"said the association's take doesn't exactly match his personal view. Manfre said he thinks the castle doctrine should remain on the books and the rest be repealed.\" (Manfre had no additional comment for PolitiFact Florida, his spokesman said.)", "Miami-Dade: Miami-Dade is the most populous county in the state and home to Trayvon, but J.D. Patterson -- the county\u2019s appointed police director, the equivalent of an elected sheriff -- does not appear to have commented publicly about \"stand your ground.\" According to Huffington Post, a spokesperson for Patterson confirmed that he attended the conference but couldn\u2019t say if he voted.", "\"Director J.D.
