["A dramatic TV ad featuring an employee of a plant shuttered by Bain Capital is getting new life in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Colorado, Virginia and Florida.\n\nIt claims Mitt Romney \"made over a hundred million dollars\" by shutting down a paper products factory in Marion, Ind.\n\nPriorities USA Action, a pro-Obama super PAC, created the TV ad, which has also been viewed more than 2.7 million times on YouTube since its debut in June.\n\nThe ad, designed to portray Romney as an enemy of the middle class, tells the story of employees who built a stage \u2014 only to watch company officials announce they had all lost their jobs.\n\n\"Turns out that when we built that stage, it was like building my own coffin. And it just made me sick,\" says Mike Earnest, one of the workers.\n\nNear the end of his story, Earnest claims: \"Mitt Romney made over a hundred million dollars by shutting down our plant, and devastated our lives.\"\n\nIt\u2019s a heart-wrenching story. We wondered: Is it true that Romney \"made over a hundred million dollars\" by shutting down the plant?\n\nAs it turns out, there are several things wrong with this claim.\n\n Bain, Ampad and SCM Office Supplies\n\nRomney was CEO of a private equity firm, Bain Capital. A Bain company called Ampad did buy the Marion paper plant in 1994, while he was on leave running for Senate, and shut it down in 1995.\n\nAt the time, Ampad was profitable. But there\u2019s disagreement about the health of the Marion plant, known as SCM Office Supplies. Workers argued it was fine before Ampad came along, and the super PAC and the Romney camp marshal various documents to argue it made a profit, and that it didn\u2019t.\n\nEither way, it was quickly in trouble when workers, who had to reapply for their jobs after the Ampad purchase, decided to strike rather than accept lower-paid positions.\n\nBut what is clear is that no one made \"made over a hundred million dollars\" from shutting down a paper plant.\n\nBain and its investors made over a hundred million dollars from their entire investment in Ampad, which they purchased in 1992, before the company was liquidated in 2001. (They sold off most of their investment and gave up control of the company with a public offering in 1996, according to Bain spokeswoman Charlyn Lusk.)\n\nA chart from the Boston Globe shows Bain and its investors made their money primarily through two main events: as part of Ampad\u2019s borrowing to buy an envelope and stationery maker in 1995, and by selling Ampad stock in 1996. Under Bain, Ampad grew to generate hundreds of millions of dollars in sales, far beyond the scale of the single Marion plant.\n\nWe contacted Priorities USA Action for support for its ad\u2019s claim.\n\nSpokesman Brennan Bilberry pointed us to evidence that Romney was directly involved with the decision to shut down the Marion plant, and to prospectuses and news articles showing Bain earned a more than 2,000 percent return in its Ampad investment \u2014 at least $102 million.\n\nHe argued that reducing costs from the Marion plant helped drive Ampad\u2019s profit.\n\nStill, the evidence he provided shows that was the profit for a much larger investment involving multiple acquisitions over years.\n\n Our ruling\n\nA former plant employee in an ad from Priorities USA Action says, \"Mitt Romney made over a hundred million dollars by shutting down our plant.\"\n\nThe Marion plant\u2019s purchase and closure was part of a larger investment in paper products manufacturing that earned Bain and its investors over $100 million. It\u2019s a sad tale for Marion workers: Their plant was sold. They lost their jobs, had to reapply to make less, and went on strike. Ultimately Bain closed the plant.\n\nBut shutting down the plant didn\u2019t make Romney $100 million. That was the profit made by Bain and its investors, only some of which would have been earned by Romney. And it was earned for the entire Ampad investment \u2014 not as a result of closing a single manufacturing site.\n\nWe rate the ad\u2019s claim Mostly False.", "Priorities USA Action, \"Stage,\" June 23, 2012, via YouTube\n\nPriorities USA Action, \"The Real Romney Record: Ampad,\" accessed Nov. 2, 2012\n\nEmail interview with Brennan Bilberry, spokesman for Priorities USA Action, Nov. 2, 2012\n\nEmail interview with Robert Terra, spokesman for the Romney campaign, Nov. 2, 2012\n\nEmail interview with Charlyn Lusk, public relations for Bain Capital, Stanton Public Relations & Marketing, Nov. 2, 2012\n\nEmail interview with Josh Kosman, reporter at the New York Post, author of book \"The Buyout of America: How Private Equity is Destroying Jobs and Killing the American Economy,\" May 30, 2012\n\nInterview with Theo Francis, senior reporter, footnoted*, Nov. 5, 2012\n\nNPR, \"How Mitt Romney's Firm Tried \u2014 And Failed \u2014 To Build a Paper Empire,\" Feb. 23, 2012\n\nBoston Globe, \"As Bain slashed jobs, Romney stayed to side,\" Jan. 27, 2008\n\nPOLITICO, \"The Bain of Mitt's campaign,\" July 14, 2011\n\nLos Angeles Times, \"To assess Romney, look beyond the bottom line,\" Dec. 16, 2007\n\nBoston Globe, \"WORKERS PRESS ROMNEY ON LAYOFFS AS IN '94, BAIN IMPACT AT ISSUE,\" Oct. 29, 2002, via Nexis\n\nBoston Globe, \"Ampad: A controversial deal,\" accessed Nov. 2, 2012\n\nNew York Times, \"THE 1994 CAMPAIGN: LABOR; Bitter Strike in Indiana Echoes in Massachusetts,\" Oct. 10, 1994\n\nDaily Caller, \"Strongest case against Romney a few sheets short of a ream,\" Jan. 18, 2012\n\nBoston Globe,\"'Their mission is to make money'; But in doing so, Romney did more building than slashing,\" Oct. 9, 1994, via Nexis\n\nBoston Globe, \"Business record helps, hinders Romney,\" Oct. 24, 2002, via Nexis\n\nAssociated Press, \"Kennedy Ads Feature Workers Laid Off In Romney-Engineered Takeover,\" Oct. 10, 1994, via Nexis\n\nWashington Post, \"Democratic leaders back Obama\u2019s Bain strategy vs. Romney, acknowledge risks,\" May 27, 2012\n\n New York Magazine, \"The Romney Economy,\" Oct. 23, 2011\n\nWall Street Journal, \"Romney at Bain: Big Gains, Some Busts,\" Jan. 9, 2012", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
