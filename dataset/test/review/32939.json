The next stop on his African trip was South Africa where he delivered the annual Mandela Lecture in Johannesburg.", "The clip from the grand opening of the center in Kogelo shows him saying, \"Three years ago, I visited Kenya as the first sitting American president to come from Kenya.\"", "He\u2019s talking about a July 2015 trip to Kenya and Ethiopia for the annual Global Entrepreneurship Summit.", "Obama did use those words (check the 5:50-minute mark of this video). But it doesn\u2019t support the impression the article gives, which is that birther claims should be re-investigated because Obama admitted he \"comes from Kenya.\" The article frames his comment as a \"slip.\"", "The article goes on to cite an Economist/YouGov.com poll\u00a0\u2014 from Decembrer 2016 \u2014 that found one-third of Americans don\u2019t believe Obama was born in Hawaii.

We debunked this back in 2009 with a fact-check where a Kenyan official confirms the certificate is phony.", "The article doesn\u2019t consider that the former president is describing his heritage rather than alluding to his father\u2019s home country being his actual place of birth. (We reached out to Obama\u2019s adviser Eric Schultz for a comment and received no response.)", "The article takes his statement of being \"from\" somewhere to mean that he literally grew up there. Obama has denied being born outside of the United States on several occasions.", "Part of our process is to reach out to the author of claims we\u2019re checking. The author of this story, Alex Hall, has authored nine other stories for Supreme Insider but none of them have contact information.
