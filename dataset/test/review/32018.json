["About this rating", "On 21 August 2018, President Donald Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to eight criminal charges, including multiple counts of tax evasion and violations of federal campaign finance laws. Cohen also appeared to implicate his former client in possible criminal wrongdoing, alleging that Trump, while a candidate, directed Cohen to pay hush money to two women who claimed to have had affairs with the future president.", "Those bombshell revelations came on the same afternoon that a jury in Virginia convicted President Trump's former 2016 presidential campaign chairman Paul Manafort on eight counts of banking fraud and filing false tax returns, while failing to agree on a verdict for ten other charges.", "Both the Manafort and Cohen cases came about due to investigative work undertaken as part of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe into potential Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election  and the possibility of Russian collusion with the Trump campaign.", "Understandably, much of the news media in the United States gave these major developments extensive coverage that day, in print, online, and on the major television news networks.", "Some observers accused the conservative-leaning Fox News of downplaying the Cohen and Manafort stories, or of deliberately focusing on other issues of lesser import. Elements of this criticism were accurate and proportionate in pointing out the striking differences between how most TV news networks reported on the developments and how Fox News covered them.", "However, one viral Twitter post appeared to contain a screen shot of Fox News contributor Tomi Lahren discussing the 'War on Christmas,' while other networks covered Cohen's guilty pleas. The chyron in the image read \"TOMI: OBAMA CREATED FESTIVUS TO DESTROY CHRISTMAS.\"", "(Festivus is an unofficial holiday which acts as an alternative to Christmas, and originated in an episode of the sitcom \"Seinfeld.\")", "CNN: Michael Cohen to plead guilty.\nABC: Michael Cohen to plead guilty.\nNBC: Michael Cohen to plead guilty.\nFOX News: pic.twitter.com/JR4uAnyCQn", "\u2014 Diane N.
