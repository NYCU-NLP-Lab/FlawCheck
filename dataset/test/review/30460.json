["About this rating", "A February 2020 tweet posted to the account of U.S. President Donald Trump in which he truly congratulated the wrong state (i.e., Kansas rather than Missouri) for the Kansas City Chiefs' Super Bowl win drew attention to another purported Trump tweet that appeared online in mid-2018. The latter complained that the president had been turned away by Arthur Bryant's, a famous Kansas City barbecue restaurant:", "Trump had indeed been in Kansas City, Missouri, at that time to deliver a speech at the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) convention and to attend a fundraiser for Republican U.S. Senate candidate Josh Hawley, but the notion that Trump went out looking for barbecue and ended up getting turned away by Arthur Bryant's was a false one, as the restaurant confirmed:", "The Trump tweet about Arthur Bryant's was a fabricated one that never actually appeared in the timeline of Trump's tweets. It incorporated several satirical in-jokes and references that might not be obvious to everyone reading it today:", "As noted in contemporaneous news reports, the restaurant's PR team at the time issued a statement countering the fake tweet that read in part:", "We would have graciously welcomed President Trump in the same manner we have welcomed many other Presidents and legislators. At Arthur Bryant\u2019s we respect the office of the Presidency and we value all of our customers: Republican, Democrat, Libertarian, or other. Our barbeque transcends political parties! I guess we got our own little piece of Fake News going on.", "KMBC-TV. \u00a0 \"Arthur Bryant's Burnt Over Fake Social Media Post Claiming Trump Was Turned Away.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 25 July 2018.", "Durkheimer, Michael. \u00a0 \"The Trump-Ketchup Controversy.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Forbes. \u00a0 22 May 2017.", "Riotta, Chris. \u00a0 \"Fox News Was Attacking Barack Obama for Using Dijon Mustard at This Point in His Presidency.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Newsweek. \u00a0 9 June 2017.", "Jackson, David. \u00a0 \"Obama Dines at Arthur Bryant's.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 USA Today. \u00a0 30 July 2014.", "Plake, Sarah. \u00a0 \"Arthur Bryant's Turned Away Trump?
