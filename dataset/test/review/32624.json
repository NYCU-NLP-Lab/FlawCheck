["Comparisons between the current president and first lady and Barack and Michelle Obama have not ceased since the 2016 election. A viral meme, made by conservative group Turning Point USA and posted by the Facebook page \u201cDonald Trump Fan Club,\u201d claims the Obamas threw around taxpayer dollars, in the form of salary and payroll, more freely than the Trumps.", "The post, which depicts the couples, alleges that Barack Obama donated \u201cnone\u201d of his salary, while Donald Trump donates all of his, and Melania Trump reportedly has a staff of four, but Michelle Obama had a staff of 23.", "More:Fact check: Former US presidents vary in their public statements about Trump", "Donald Trump has made a similar claim before, arguing that he\u2019s the first president to give away his salary.", "\u201cI give away my presidential salary,\u201d Trump told reporters at a gathering of his Cabinet, according to POLITICO. \u201cThey say no other president has done it. I'm surprised, to be honest with you. They say George Washington may have been the only other president to do that. See whether or not Obama gave up his salary. See whether or not all of the other of your favorites, your other favorites gave up their salary. The answer is no.\u201d", "The Facebook page \u201cDonald Trump Fan Club\u201d did not respond to USA TODAY\u2019s request for comment and clarification.", "\"This meme was reposted by another page that TPUSA obviously doesn't control and TPUSA hasn\u2019t posted anything like this in a very long time,\" said Andrew Kolvet, a spokesperson for Turning Point USA.", "U.S. presidents make $400,000 a year.", "It\u2019s true that Trump donates his salary. Though presidents are required to be compensated for their work, Trump\u00a0takes just $1 each year from his paychecks. He has donated a quarter of his annual\u00a0salary to a different government agency each fiscal quarter. Most recently, he donated his salary from the fourth quarter of 2019 to the Department of Health and Human Services in effort to support the fight against COVID-19.", "More:Fact check: President Donald Trump donates his salary, but he still makes money", "While Obama did not convert his whole salary into donations, it\u2019s false to say he donated none of it.

Both Herbert Hoover and John F. Kennedy donated their salaries, as they entered office wealthy like Trump.", "According to the 2020 annual report to Congress on White House office personnel, there are eight roles directly tied to the first lady via title. But there are other staffers who work for the first lady and do not have that phrase in their title. Forbes confirmed in June that the first lady has 11 people on her staff.", "In 2017, the same annual report listed four roles directly tied to the first lady via title, but at the time the report was released, Melania Trump had lived in the White House for a little over two weeks.

It\u2019s true that the current president donates his salary, but Obama donated about $2.5 million to charities while in office. Michelle Obama\u2019s staff was about 25, but Melania Trump\u2019s is about 11.", "Thank you for supporting our journalism.
