["By Eugene Kiely and Robert Farley", "Posted on November 15, 2019", "On April 21, the White House issued a statement saying President Donald Trump called to congratulate Volodymyr Zelensky on becoming president of Ukraine. Trump \u201cexpressed his commitment to work together with President-elect Zelenskyy and the Ukrainian people to implement reforms that strengthen democracy, increase prosperity, and root out corruption,\u201d the statement said.", "But Trump did not discuss his commitment to help root out corruption, or any of the other policy issues mentioned in the April 21 statement, according to the official White House memo of that phone call, which was released today via tweet.", "In his phone call, according to the call memo, Trump talked about the strength of the U.S. economy since his own election, how he will send someone \u201cat a very, very high level\u201d to Zelensky\u2019s inauguration, and the Miss Universe Pageant, which Trump used to own. Trump put off any discussion of issues, saying that in the future they will have \u201ca lot of things to talk about.\u201d", "We asked the White House about the discrepancy between the April 21 statement and the call memo released today, and it sent us an email that read, in part: \u201cIt is standard operating procedure for the National Security Council to provide readouts of the President\u2019s phone calls with foreign leaders. This one was prepared by the NSC\u2019s Ukraine expert.\u201d", "The call memo is not a transcript of the phone call. There is a note on all such memos that says, \u201cA Memorandum of a Telephone Conversation (TELCON) is not a verbatim transcript of a discussion. The text in this document records the notes and recollections of Situation Room Duty Officers and NSC policy staff assigned to listen and memorialize the conversation in written form as the conversation takes place.\u201d", "We have written about the \u201ccaution\u201d note several times when Trump has falsely claimed that the call memo of his July 25 phone call with Zelensky was an \u201cexact transcript.\u201d For example, in his closed deposition before the House committees conducting the impeachment inquiry, Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman, a National Security Council staffer who listened in on Trump\u2019s July 25 call with Zelensky, testified that certain words and phrases were omitted from the White House-released memo of the call.", "Specifically, Vindman said his notes of the meeting indicated that Trump said \u201cthere are recordings\u201d of Vice President Joe Biden bragging about stopping the prosecution of Burisma Holdings, the energy company whose board employed Biden\u2019s son, Hunter. But the call memo did not include a mention of the recordings. (As we\u2019ve written, Biden did not brag about stopping the prosecution; Trump distorts the facts of that recording.)", "Vindman also said in his deposition that Zelensky mentioned \u201cBurisma\u201d in his July 25 phone call, although the call memo showed Zelensky referring only to \u201cthe company,\u201d without mentioning the firm\u2019s name.", "So, some details of the issues discussed were lacking in that call memo. However, the issues themselves were referenced \u2014 contrary to the vast discrepancy between the White House statement and call memo of the April 21 phone conversation.", "The White House released the April 21 statement \u2014 known as a \u201creadout\u201d \u2014 via an email from Jack Fitzpatrick of Bloomberg Government, who was the pool reporter covering the president that day in Washington, D.C.", "White House statement, April 21: Readout of President Trump\u2019s Call With Ukrainian President-Elect Volodymyr Zelenskyy.", "President Donald J. Trump spoke today with President-elect Volodymyr Zelenskyy to congratulate him on his victory in Ukraine\u2019s April 21 election. The President wished him success and called the election an important moment in Ukraine\u2019s history, noting the peaceful and democratic manner of the electoral process. President Trump underscored the unwavering support of the United States for Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity \u2013 within its internationally recognized borders \u2013 and expressed his commitment to work together with President-elect Zelenskyy and the Ukrainian people to implement reforms that strengthen democracy, increase prosperity, and root out corruption.", "In addition to the White House readout of the call, unnamed White House officials also have told reporters the president mentioned his concerns about corruption in that April call with Zelensky.", "For example, a Nov. 14 Wall Street Journal article cited \u201ctwo officials with direct knowledge\u201d who described the call as \u201cvery brief\u201d and said that in addition to offering introductory pleasantries, \u201cTrump also encouraged Ukraine\u2019s president-elect to follow through on his commitments to tackle corruption.\u201d", "The same day, CNN reported that a \u201cperson familiar with its [the phone call\u2019s] contents\u201d said that in addition to congratulations offered on Zelensky\u2019s election victory, \u201cTrump also encouraged Zelensky to continue going after corruption in Ukraine, but didn\u2019t specifically mention the Bidens or the 2016 elections.\u201d", "But there is no evidence in the call memo that Trump brought up the issue of corruption with Zelensky in the April 21 call.", "Trump did congratulate Zelensky and indicated U.S. support for Ukraine, according to the call memo. \u201cWe\u2019re with you all the way,\u201d Trump told Zelensky, the memo shows.", "But instead of committing to help Ukraine with its reforms, democracy, prosperity and corruption \u2014 as the media statement said \u2014 Trump talked about the U.S. economy since he took office and the Miss Universe Pageant.", "After congratulating Zelensky on his \u201cincredible achievement,\u201d Trump went on to say, \u201cI guess, in a way, I did something similar. We\u2019re making tremendous progress in the U.S. [United States] \u2014 we have the most tremendous economy ever.\u201d", "After Zelensky described Ukraine as a \u201cwonderful country,\u201d Trump agreed. \u201cWhen I owned Miss Universe, they always had great people. Ukraine was always very well represented.\u201d", "Zelensky invited Trump to Ukraine for his inauguration, but Trump was noncommittal. Trump said he would send \u201csomebody, at a minimum, at a very, very high level\u201d to the inauguration.", "According to the Aug. 12 whistleblower report, which triggered the impeachment inquiry, Vice President Mike Pence was scheduled to attend Zelensky\u2019s swearing-in ceremony, but Trump canceled those plans on May 14 \u2014 just six days before the inauguration. Instead, Energy Secretary Rick Perry led the White House delegation to the May 20 inauguration.", "The House committees investigating the president are seeking to determine if the cancellation of Pence\u2019s trip to Ukraine in May was related to the president\u2019s efforts to pressure Zelensky to investigate the Bidens and unsupported allegations of Ukrainian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.", "The committees are also gathering evidence that Trump withheld congressionally authorized security aid to Ukraine in exchange for Zelensky\u2019s public declaration that he will undertake those investigations.", "Trump has maintained that one of the reasons he withheld security aid to Ukraine was because of concerns about corruption in the country. He\u00a0told\u00a0reporters on Sept. 23, \u201cWe want to make sure that country is honest. It\u2019s very important to talk about corruption. If you don\u2019t talk about corruption, why would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt?\u201d", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
