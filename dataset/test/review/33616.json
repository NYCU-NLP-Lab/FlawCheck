["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on May 13, 2020", "Viral posts on social media falsely claim that a House bill would \u201cgive the government the power to forcibly remove\u201d children from their homes. That\u2019s not true. The bill actually provides $100 billion to\u00a0fund COVID-19 contact tracing efforts.", "A House bill that would fund organizations to trace and prevent COVID-19 infections has fueled a number of false and misleading claims on social media.", "One of the most egregious misrepresentations is the suggestion that it would implement forced removals of children from their homes.", "A bogus Facebook post, for example, claims the bill \u2014 unfortunately numbered H.R. 6666 \u2014 \u201cwill give the government the power to forcibly remove your family members from your home and quarantine them[.] That includes your children.\u201d", "A viral YouTube video similarly claims the legislation would \u201callow individuals to come into your house\u201d and, if you have COVID-19 symptoms or test positive, \u201cpull you or your loved ones, especially your children, away under pretense of public safety.\u201d", "But there is nothing in the bill\u2019s current language dealing with forced removals, or giving anyone the authority to simply enter people\u2019s homes without consent to conduct tests.", "The bill \u2014 the COVID-19 Testing, Reaching, And Contacting Everyone (TRACE) Act \u2014 outlines a $100 billion program to be managed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to award grants to \u201celigible entities,\u201d such as health centers and clinics, universities and nonprofit organizations.", "The federal money would be used by those organizations \u201cto conduct diagnostic testing for COVID-19, to trace and monitor the contacts of infected individuals, and to support the quarantine of such contacts, through\u2014 (1) mobile health units; and (2) as necessary, testing individuals and providing individuals with services related to testing and quarantine at their residences.\u201d", "Those provisions support the concept of contact tracing, a public health technique that, as we\u2019ve previously explained, involves identifying those who have had contact with an infected person so that those people can be warned and ideally tested or quarantined.", "According to the bill, the funds would be used by the recipient organizations \u201cto hire, train, compensate, and pay the expenses of individuals\u201d and to \u201cpurchase personal protective equipment and other supplies.\u201d Organizations in hot spots \u2014 areas with cases of the novel coronavirus higher than the national average \u2014 and those in \u201cmedically underserved communities\u201d would be given priority.", "David Studdert, a Stanford University professor of law and medicine, told us in an email that \u201cthere is nothing in the text of the bill\u201d supporting the claim about forced removals. He pointed to the bill\u2019s language that explicitly supports \u201ctesting individuals and providing individuals with services related to testing and quarantine at their residences.\u201d (Emphasis ours.)", "The CDC calls contact tracing a \u201ckey strategy for preventing further spread of COVID-19,\u201d and many public health experts have cited it as an important component, too.", "An April report by the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, for example, said a \u201ccase-based intervention approach \u2026 will be impossible to achieve for COVID-19 without a new national initiative that combines a massive expansion of rapid diagnostic tests in every community with an unprecedented growth in a public health workforce and adoption of new technologies dedicated to case identification and contact tracing in each state.\u201d", "\u201cIn order to trace all contacts, safely isolate the sick, and quarantine those exposed, we estimate that our public health workforce needs to add approximately 100,000 (paid or volunteer) contact tracers to assist with this large-scale effort,\u201d the report says.", "It\u2019s worth noting that existing state laws \u2014 and, to a lesser extent, federal law and regulations \u2014 already provide the government the authority to mandate quarantine or isolation to curb the spread of communicable diseases. But they\u2019re not without limits or challenges.", "\u201cIn broad strokes, the state can involuntarily isolate a person who is both sick and dangerous to the community,\u201d Nicole Huberfeld, a Boston University professor of health law, ethics and human rights, told us in an email. \u201cA number of judicial decisions have been issued over time that pertain to isolating a person who has, for example, drug-resistant TB, and they consistently have held that the person must have both characteristics to be lawfully held.\u201d", "\u201cAdditionally, courts consistently have held that government must meet both procedural requirements and substantive requirements to involuntarily isolate a person,\u201d she said.", "Huberfeld said \u201ccourts apply procedural due process standards\u201d afforded under the Constitution to ensure they have a right to understand and oppose the decision before commitment. She added that the state must meet the \u201csubstantive standards\u201d under the Fourth Amendment, too \u2014 \u201cmeaning that government bears the burden of proving a person is both ill and dangerous to the community before she could be involuntarily isolated to avoid running afoul of the prohibition against \u2018unreasonable seizure.'\u201d", "Someone forced to isolate retains the right to refuse medical treatment, Huberfeld noted, though that could potentially prolong the isolation.", "None of this is changed by the current language in H.R. 6666 \u2014 which was introduced May 1 and is still before a House committee. As we said, there is no language in the bill proposing to \u201cforcibly remove\u201d individuals or children. And Huberfeld said the legislation does not affect the Fourth Amendment\u2019s protection against unreasonable search and seizures \u2014 meaning contact tracers wouldn\u2019t be able to just enter homes without consent to conduct tests, as the YouTube video suggests.", "The bill\u2019s sponsor, Democratic Rep. Bobby Rush of Illinois, has attempted to counter misconceptions about the bill on Twitter.", "In a radio and Facebook Live interview on May 12, Rush said (at 1:17:12): \u201cIt\u2019s all volunteer. There\u2019s nothing about this bill that says that the government is going to come into your home and snatch your children \u2026 or snatch you out of the home. There\u2019s nothing that remotely even hints at that.\u201d", "Another erroneous post claims the bill will give funding only to entities that \u201cagree by contract that they will only allow people in their facilities that have the covid 19 vaccination, are tested and tracked.\u201d There is no mention of vaccines, let alone contracts stipulating mandatory vaccinations, in the bill.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
