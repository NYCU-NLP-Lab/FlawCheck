A large majority \u2014 77% \u2014 said stricter controls were needed.", "The other key flaw in the post is that it assumes all of the negative results \u2014 which themselves are subject to interpretation \u2014 were caused by the wearing of masks. There was no effort to standardize the description of the kids\u2019 reactions, and no control group.", "Some of the children might have always been reluctant to go to kindergarten. Some of them might always have had trouble concentrating.", "Without standards on capturing data on how the children reacted, and without a matched group of children who didn\u2019t wear masks, there\u2019s no way to say that the masks caused the children\u2019s reactions.", "The result is a jumble of numbers, not valid data.", "This Instagram post recycled a claim made in early January.
