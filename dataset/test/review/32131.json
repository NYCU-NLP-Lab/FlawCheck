["Joyous New Berlin Eisenhower High School graduates tossed their mortar boards toward the sky at the end of graduation ceremonies Saturday, June 11, 2016", "Few states top Wisconsin\u2019s K-12 graduation rate -- and the rate has gone up in recent years.", "State School Superintendent Tony Evers boasted on his Facebook page on Feb. 13, 2017 that \"Wisconsin\u2019s graduation rates have grown to over 90 percent\" since his election.", "Evers is seeking a third term in the April 2017 election against challenger Lowell Holtz, a former school superintendent and principal.", "When asked to back up the Facebook claim, the Evers campaign pointed to graduation rates published by the agency Evers oversees, the Department of Public Instruction.", "The reports, they say, show a rate of 85.7 percent in 2009-10 (Evers\u2019 first year) that rose to more than 90 percent in subsequent years.", "Case closed?", "No. Let\u2019s put our red pencil and green eye shade to work.", "How rates are tracked", "The state and federal governments employ two methods to track changes in the four-year graduation rate.", "The first method -- dating to the 1960s -- estimates the four-year graduation rate from aggregate figures on enrollment and graduate counts.", "It shows Wisconsin\u2019s rate was above 90 percent before Evers even took office. The latest figure reported under that method: 92 percent, in 2011-12.", "The second method, which is newer and more accurate, tracks detailed student-level data.", "That method dates to 2009-10 in Wisconsin. It shows a rising rate from 85.7 percent in Evers\u2019 first year up to 88.4 percent in 2014-15.", "So neither approach backs up Evers\u2019 claim.", "For the record, the state\u2019s rate of 88.4 percent for on-time graduation (four years) ranked 6th-highest nationally by the latest numbers, which is actually a drop from No. 2 four years earlier.", "Behind the claim", "So where do the numbers cited by the Evers campaign come from?", "Those numbers look at how many students from a 9th-grade class graduate over five or six years, not four years.", "Wisconsin began tracking so-called \"extended-year graduation\" in Evers\u2019 first year; dozens of other states also collect it.", "Viewed this way, Evers campaign says, the class of 2009-10 four-year graduation rate for the class of 2009-10 was 85.7 percent. It rose to 89.5 percent after five years and to 90.4 percent after six years.", "A similar growth pattern appears in later years, when you track an individual class.", "But we can\u2019t judge if the same thing was happening before Evers, because the collection of the extended-year graduation rate didn\u2019t start until his second year.", "So we can\u2019t fully evaluate whether these figures show that \"Wisconsin\u2019s graduation rates have grown to over 90 percent\" since he took over.", "But, even if they did, it would apply to the less-used \"extended-year rate,\" not the more conventional 4-year rate that is better known to the average person.", "Our rating", "Evers claimed on Facebook: \"Wisconsin\u2019s graduation rates have grown to over 90%\" since he became state school superintendent.", "By the traditional measure -- graduation in four years -- Wisconsin\u2019s rate is one of the best in America, but still below 90 percent using one approach. Using the other, it topped that mark before Evers even took office.", "Meanwhile, the extended-year graduation rate provides an element of truth to the claim.", "That puts it at \u00a0Mostly False.", "Evers campaign Facebook post, Feb. 13, 2017", "Interview with Thomas McCarthy, Department of Public Instruction spokesman, Feb. 22, 2017", "Interview with Amanda Brink, Evers campaign spokesperson, Feb. 22, 2017", "Interview with Mark Glander, U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, Common Core of Data Surveys, Feb. 23, 2017", "Interview with Joseph Murphy, National Center for Education Statistics, Feb. 23, 2017", "Interview with Robert Stillwell, Administrative Data Division: Elementary and Secondary Branch, \u00a0National Center for Education Statistics, Feb. 23, 2017", "Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction, high school completion data files, accessed Feb. 23, 2017", "U.S. Department of Education, Trends in High School Dropout and Completion Rates in the United States: 1972\u20132012, June 2015", "National Center for Education Statistics, Public High School Graduation Rates, May 2016", "National Center for Education Statistics, Dropouts, Completers and Graduation Rate Reports, Common Core of Data", "National Center for Education Statistics, Table 1.
