["By Robert Farley and Eugene Kiely", "Posted on March 19, 2020", "President Donald Trump touted two drugs \u2014 including one currently on the market for other uses \u2014 that he said show \u201creally good promise\u201d as therapies to COVID-19. But he left the misleading impression that the drugs were \u201capproved\u201d to treat the coronavirus and available for \u201cimmediate delivery.\u201d", "In fact, neither of the drugs the president highlighted at a press conference on March 19 have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use as therapy for COVID-19, though the FDA is moving forward rapidly with clinical trials.", "The FDA is \u201clooking at drugs that are already approved for other indications,\u201d and that doctors can currently prescribe off-label. The FDA plans to study the results of those drugs in hopes that they can be offered as \u201cbridge\u201d therapies as they await completion of clinical trials for a vaccine, which may take a year, FDA Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn said.", "\u201cWe need to make sure that these \u2014 this sea of new treatments will get the right drug to the right patient at the right dosage at the right time,\u201d Hahn said, speaking just after Trump. \u201cAs an example, we may have the right drug, but it may not be in the appropriate dosage form right now, and that may do more harm than good.\u201d", "In a press release, Hahn said that while some of the therapies being investigated show \u201cpromise,\u201d the FDA \u201calso must ensure these products are effective; otherwise we risk treating patients with a product that might not work when they could have pursued other, more appropriate, treatments.\u201d", "Trump first mentioned chloroquine, an old drug used to prevent and treat malaria, as well as to treat rheumatoid arthritis and lupus.", "Trump said it has shown \u201cvery, very encouraging early results\u201d for use in people who have contracted the novel coronavirus. An article published in February in Nature found that the drug limited infection of the virus in cells grown in the lab, and the authors recommended it be assessed in human patients. It is currently being tested in clinical trials in China, where it is included in government guidelines for treating coronavirus patients.", "Trump noted that because it has been around for a long time, its side effects are well known \u201cso we know that \u2026 if things don\u2019t go as planned, it\u2019s not going to kill anybody.\u201d The president described the drug as \u201ca tremendous breakthrough\u201d and a potential \u201cgame-changer.\u201d", "But he got a bit ahead of himself on the process.", "\u201cAnd we\u2019re going to be able to make that drug available almost immediately,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s where the FDA has been so great. They\u2019ve gone through the approval process; it\u2019s been approved. And they took it down from many, many months to immediate. So we\u2019re going to be able to make that drug available by prescription.\u201d", "\u201cThere\u2019s tremendous promise. And normally the FDA would take a long time to approve something like that, and it\u2019s \u2014 it was approved very, very quickly and it\u2019s now approved, by prescription,\u201d Trump said.", "To be clear, chloroquine is not approved by the FDA for use on people with the coronavirus.", "Hahn said chloroquine is approved \u201cfor the treatment of malaria as well as an arthritis condition.\u201d The FDA is considering an \u201cexpanded use\u201d trial of patients in the U.S. \u201cto actually see if that benefits patients. And again, we want to do that in the setting of a clinical trial \u2014 a large, pragmatic clinical trial \u2014 to actually gather that information and answer the question that needs to be answered and \u2014 asked and answered.\u201d", "According to an FDA press release issued after the press conference, \u201cThe FDA has been working closely with other government agencies and academic centers that are investigating the use of the drug chloroquine, which is already approved for treating malaria, lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, to determine whether it can be used to treat patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 to potentially reduce the duration of symptoms, as well as viral shedding, which can help prevent the spread of disease. Studies are underway to determine the efficacy in using chloroquine to treat COVID-19.\u201d", "Hahn declined to speculate how long it might take before chloroquine \u2014 provided everything goes well in the clinical trials and the drug is deemed \u201csafe and effective\u201d \u2014 might be approved for use for COVID-19.", "\u201cWe want to make sure that this is done well and right for the American people,\u201d Hahn said. \u201cThe president is right. With an off-the-shelf drug, we do have a lot of information about the side effects of the drug.\u00a0 So that really helps, in terms of expediting.\u00a0 But \u2014 but I want to assure you that we\u2019re working as quickly as we can.\u00a0 I don\u2019t want to speculate about a timeline at this point.\u201d", "In the meantime, if the drug show promise, the FDA says it will \u201cengage with domestic manufacturers to ramp up production of this product to mitigate any potential supply chain pressures.\u201d", "As for remdesivir, Trump misleadingly said \u201cthat drug also has been approved or very close to approved, in that case, by the FDA.\u201d", "That drug has only been approved for a clinical trial, not for consumer use.", "On Feb. 25, the National Institutes of Health announced that it had begun a clinical trial \u201cto evaluate the safety and efficacy of the investigational antiviral remdesivir in hospitalized adults diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)\u201d at the University of Nebraska.", "The trial participants will be randomly assigned without their knowledge either remdesivir or a placebo.", "\u201cIt was previously tested in humans with Ebola virus disease and has shown promise in animal models for treating Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which are caused by other coronaviruses,\u201d NIH said.", "As the president said, remdesivir was developed by Gilead Sciences Inc.\u00a0Daniel O\u2019Day, chairman and CEO of Gilead Sciences,\u00a0said\u00a0at a March 2 White House meeting that the company hopes to know by April if the drug works.", "Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has said that \u2014 if all goes right \u2014 the drug could be ready for mass production by June.", "\u201c[I]f the trial that Daniel is talking about proves efficacy, which you likely might know in a few months whether it\u2019s \u2026 effective or not,\u201d Fauci said. \u201cIf you know by June that it\u2019s effective, then you just scale up and manufacture it, and you\u2019re good to go.\u201d", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
