["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on December 17, 2019", "There\u2019s no evidence for a meme that quotes President Donald Trump\u2019s late mother as once making a disparaging remark about her son and predicting he would not do well in politics.", "A meme posted repeatedly on Facebook in recent days attributes a supposed quote about President Donald Trump to his late mother, Mary Anne MacLeod Trump, but there\u2019s no evidence she ever said it.", "\u201cYes, he\u2019s an idiot with zero common sense, and no social skills, but he IS my son,\u201d the dubious statement reads. \u201cI just hope he never goes into politics. He\u2019d be a disaster.\u201d", "The meme offers no citation for the quote, and we couldn\u2019t find anything to lend it credibility: We searched online and through news archives and found no such statement from Mary Trump, who died in August 2000.", "Trump\u2019s mother criticizing her son and forecasting his potential entrance into politics \u2014 not to mention calling such a move a \u201cdisaster\u201d \u2014 would have no doubt made the quotation newsworthy, if she had said it, at the time and again later. Before Mary Trump died, Donald Trump already had become a wealthy developer and casino owner who gained celebrity status and publicly considered running for president in the late 1990s, before deciding not to run. The supposed quote also would have likely resurfaced during his 2016 presidential campaign.", "\u201cA mothers choice words,\u201d wrote one user whose post of the meme earned about 1,000 shares. Another user remarked in a comment: \u201cShe knew full well what she gave birth to.\u201d", "We\u2019ve written about many bogus quotes relating to politics that have gained virality on social media.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media. Our previous stories can be found\u00a0here.", "Kruse, Michael. \u201cThe Mystery of Mary Trump.\u201d Politico. December 2017.", "\u201cMary MacLeod Trump Philanthropist, 88.\u201d New York Times. 9 Aug 2000.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
