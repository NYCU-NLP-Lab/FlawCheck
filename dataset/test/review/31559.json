["About this rating", "In the wake of Prince's death on 21 April 2016, a\u00a0variety of rumors regarding his\u00a0life and career immediately\u00a0sprang up and began floating\u00a0around the internet. Among them was the claim that his half-brother was Haywood Nelson, an actor best known for his role on the television show\u00a0What's Happening!!:", "While most of these rumors were simply made up out of whole cloth (such as Prince's reported involvement with bringing Michael Jordan to Nike and his alleged devotion to the Republican party), the claim that Haywood Nelson and Prince\u00a0were half-brothers appears to have stemmed from genuine confusion.", "The internet was inundated with information about Prince shortly after his death. For instance, the web site\u00a0Heavy.com\u00a0published an article stating the \"five facts you need to know\" about the musician,\u00a0which included the names of all eight\u00a0of Prince's siblings:", "Prince has eight\u00a0brothers and sisters. Tyka Nelson is his only full-blooded sibling. He has five half-brothers and half-sisters from his dad, John L. Nelson, and Vivian Nelson. They are\u00a0Lorna Nelson, Norrine Nelson, Sharon Nelson, Duane Nelson, and John R. Nelson.", "Duane Nelson, Prince\u2019s half brother, was Prince\u2019s head of security and he passed away when he was only 52.\u00a0Lorna Nelson, Prince\u2019s sister, passed away when she was only 63, in 2006.", "Prince also has two lesser-known half-brothers, born to his mom, Mattie.", "Omarr Baker was\u00a0born to his mom, Mattie Della Baker, after she married Hayward Baker following her divorce from Prince\u2019s dad. Not much is known about Omarr, except he may have been born in 1970, according to an online ebook about Prince.", "Alfred Jackson, Prince\u2019s older half-brother, was\u00a0born to his mom\u00a0Mattie Della Baker.", "While Haywood Nelson is not listed above, Prince did have a sibling named Duane Nelson, which was also the name of the character Haywood Nelson played on the show\u00a0What's Happening!! (Although in that case, it was spelled \"Dwayne\".)", "There's no chance that Duane Nelson and Dwayne Nelson could be the same person for two reasons:\u00a0Dwayne Nelson is a fictional character, and Prince's half-brother Duane passed away in 2013; the actor who played Dwayne \u2014 Haywood Nelson \u2014 is still alive.", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
