Chris Christie said was leaving to better support his family. The comptroller's salary was $140,000. Corfield commended the comptroller's accomplishments, adding that the position's salary is a \"comfortable\" one for a family of four in the Garden State.", "Corfield then called out Christie -- \"the governor of the state with the highest unemployment rate in the region, stagnant job growth\" and a low minimum wage \u2013 as pompous, for suggesting that Boxer may have been struggling on such a salary.", "For this fact check, though, we\u2019re looking only at the claims about New Jersey\u2019s unemployment rate and job growth.", "First, unemployment rates.", "The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics lists unemployment rates for the nation, each state, Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico on its website.", "We looked at unemployment rates from November \u2013 the most recent data available \u2013 to see how New Jersey ranked against Connecticut, Delaware, New York and Pennsylvania.", "New Jersey\u2019s rate was the highest among that group, at 7.8 percent.

Arizona\u2019s rate was the same as New Jersey\u2019s. Also, the states are evenly split between Democratic and Republican leadership.", "Now let\u2019s turn to the claim about \"stagnant\" job growth. Here, Corfield is off base.", "New Jersey\u2019s unemployment rate barely moved downward for the first half of Christie\u2019s first term in office, but experts have told us that the governor doesn\u2019t bare all the blame.

In addition, New Jersey\u2019s job growth rate of 1.8 percent for that time period exceeded that of New York and Connecticut, both with 1.3 percent growth, and Pennsylvania, which had job growth rates of 0.9 percent, Seneca said.", "Seneca told us that much of the state\u2019s job growth during the period he analyzed was in education, health services, leisure and hospitality, trade, transportation and utilities.", "It\u2019s important to note that Seneca and the BLS have told us it\u2019s best to measure year-over-year job data that has been seasonally adjusted in order to get the most accurate picture of job growth within a 12-month span.\nUsing that methodology, New Jersey has increased its number of private-sector jobs by 130,700 from November 2012 to November 2013.", "There have been some job losses in recent months, but on the whole, the state is gaining private-sector jobs.", "Corfield said she used the same BLS data as us to determine New Jersey\u2019s unemployment rate, and looked at an analysis on www.governing.com that showed the Garden State excels in giving tax incentives but lags in job growth. She also pointed us to a Wall Street Journal article that address New Jersey\u2019s slow job growth.\nFurther, Corfield said that while she was out campaigning for an Assembly seat, she spoke with many unhappy and unemployed constituents who \"are having a tough time finding a job.\"", "Our ruling", "Corfield claimed in a recent column that Christie is \"the governor of the state with the highest unemployment rate in the region, (and) stagnant job growth.\"", "She\u2019s right that the unemployment rate is the highest in this region, but wrong on whether New Jersey\u2019s job growth has been sluggish.", "BLS data shows clearly that while the Garden State\u2019s unemployment rate is the highest among its neighboring states, it\u2019s not the worst in the country.
