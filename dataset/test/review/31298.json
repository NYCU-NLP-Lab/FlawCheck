["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on August 7, 2019", "A social media post misleadingly claims that Republicans\u00a0\u201cvoted to allow people with pre-existing mental illness to buy firearms.\u201d The measure blocked the Social Security Administration from reporting to the U.S. background check system some disability beneficiaries who are unable to manage their finances. Federal law still prohibits people with certain conditions from buying guns.", "The mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, in a single weekend have reignited the debate over gun control, Second Amendment rights, and where mental health fits into the equation.", "On social media, a popular post muddies that debate\u00a0when referencing legislation signed by President Donald Trump in February 2017 relating to mental health and access to firearms.", "\u201cAt the next mass shooting, remember\u2026it was REPUBLICANS who voted to allow people with pre-existing mental illness to buy firearms, yet denied them health insurance to treat their pre-existing mental illness,\u201d reads the meme shared Aug. 5 by a page called \u201cGo Left.\u201d", "It\u2019s not that simple.", "The vote in question was on a 2017 House joint resolution, which we\u2019ve written about before. It didn\u2019t \u201callow\u201d everyone with a \u201cmental illness\u201d to buy firearms: Federal law still\u00a0prohibits\u00a0someone \u201cwho has\u00a0been adjudicated as a mental defective or has been committed to any mental institution\u201d from buying or possessing a gun.", "The law defines \u201cadjudicated as a mental defective\u201d as someone found by a \u201ccourt, board, commission, or other lawful authority\u201d \u2014 \u201cas a result of marked subnormal intelligence, or mental illness, incompetency, condition, or disease\u201d \u2014 to be a \u201cdanger to himself or to others\u201d or to lack \u201cthe mental capacity to contract or manage his own affairs.\u201d It also includes people found insane by a court in a criminal case, found incompetent to stand trial, or who are \u201cfound not guilty by reason of lack of mental responsibility.\u201d", "The 2017 legislative measure did, however, block the Social Security Administration from going forward with an Obama-era\u00a0rule that would have had the agency report to the FBI\u2019s\u00a0National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) certain\u00a0disability applicants \u2014 those with certain mental impairments whose benefits are handled by a representative.", "The NICS is used to determine whether an individual can buy a firearm from a federally licensed dealer, and the rule would have informed the \u201cFBI of the fact that the individual meets the criteria for inclusion in the NICS \u2026 due to a mental health prohibitor.\u201d", "Opponents of that SSA rule \u2014 including the National Rifle Association, the American Civil Liberties Union\u00a0and many\u00a0disability rights\u00a0groups \u2014 argued that it risked violating the rights of some beneficiaries by unduly preventing them from being able to buy firearms.\u00a0Some also questioned the range of\u00a0mental disorders\u00a0\u2014 including\u00a0schizophrenia, anxiety, autism, bipolar disorder and eating disorders \u2014 that could have led to reporting to the NICS, if applicants were approved for disability benefits and had someone else managing their finances.", "\u201cThe current public dialogue is replete with inaccurate stereotyping of people with mental disabilities as violent and dangerous, and there is a real concern that the kind of policy change encompassed by this rule will reinforce those unfounded assumptions,\u201d the American Association of People with Disabilities wrote at the time. It also cited the \u201cabsence of any data suggesting that there is any connection between the need for a representative payee to manage one\u2019s Social Security disability benefits and a propensity toward gun violence.\u201d", "Gun-control advocates who supported the rule, on the other hand, argued the repeal\u00a0undermined\u00a0efforts to improve the federal background check system.\u00a0It was estimated that the rule would have affected 75,000 beneficiaries annually \u2014 and compliance would have started at the end of 2017.", "It\u2019s possible that some of those Social Security beneficiaries may still be reported, as we\u2019ve explained, because laws in 47 states require or authorize the reporting of some with mental illness to the NICS or similar state databases used for background checks. According to the Giffords Law Center, 16 states \u201cspecifically mandate the reporting of individuals appointed a guardian because they lack the capacity to manage their own affairs.\u201d", "As of December 2018, the FBI\u2019s background check system\u00a0contained nearly 5.7 million \u201cactive records\u201d for individuals with \u201cadjudicated mental health.\u201d", "The social media post also makes reference to health care, claiming that Republicans \u201cdenied\u201d people with mental illness \u201chealth insurance to treat their pre-existing mental illness.\u201d", "That may be a reference to unsuccessful attempts by Republicans to replace the Affordable Care Act. Republicans in 2017 introduced several potential replacements plans \u2014 which we\u2019ve written about before. The bills did not provide the same level of protections for preexisting conditions as Obamacare, but the specifics of each plan varied.", "For instance, one House proposal \u2014 the\u00a0American Health Care Act\u00a0\u2014 required insurance companies to offer coverage regardless of preexisting conditions but also allowed them to charge more in some cases. And it also would have let states decide on their own essential benefits, whereas the Affordable Care Act requires insurers to cover\u00a010 essential benefits\u00a0(including mental health services).", "A Congressional Budget Office report on that proposal said that mental health was a service \u201clikely to be excluded from\u201d essential health benefits in some states and that out-of-pocket spending \u201ccould increase by thousands of dollars in a given year for the nongroup enrollees who would use those services.\u201d", "The National Alliance on Mental Illness said the replacement plan would \u201chave a devastating impact on mental health coverage for the 60 million children and adults in our country who are affected by mental health conditions.\u201d", "For more on this, see\u00a0\u201cThe Preexisting Conditions Debate Isn\u2019t Over.\u201d", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
