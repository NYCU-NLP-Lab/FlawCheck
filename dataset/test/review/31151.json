Put the major parties last at the Queensland election. They've betrayed us to corrupt global organisations who essentially want to turn Australia into a new type of Nazi state where you have the vaccinated (racially pure) and the unvaccinated (racially impure). The latter do not have the same rights as the former.\u201d", "The post includes a purported screenshot of a post allegedly from the verified Facebook page of Karen Andrews, a Liberal National Party MP.", "The purported post from Andrews provided details about a planned 2021 Covid-19 vaccine scheme and additional text overlaid in the image that reads: \u201cTHOSE WHO DON'T WANT IT ARE THE NEW \u2018RACIALLY IMPURE\u2019. THEY WEAR A YELLOW STAR.\u201d", "The image features a person getting an injection and the Jewish badge, a form of identification for the Jews during the Nazi era, according to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.", "The image was also shared on Facebook here, here and here alongside a similar claim.", "However, the claim is false.", "A keyword search on Facebook found the original post published here on Andrews\u2019 Facebook on September 7, 2020.
