On April 25, another judge within the 9th Circuit granted a nationwide preliminary injunction against a different Trump order, one aiming to cut federal funding to so-called sanctuary cities.", "Given Trump\u2019s record in the 9th Circuit, we wondered if his tweet was accurate \u2013 does the circuit have an overturn rate close to 80 percent?

By another, it\u2019s far less than 1 percent.", "The 9th Circuit", "Broadly speaking, the 9th Circuit includes the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals and district and bankruptcy courts in 15 federal judicial districts (among them Hawaii, and districts in Washington, California).", "It was a district judge in Hawaii who on March 15 blocked Trump\u2019s revised travel ban.", "On Feb. 3, a district judge in Seattle granted a nationwide temporary restraining order on the first version of Trump's travel ban.

On Feb. 9, in a 3-0 decision the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the Seattle judge's decision.", "An overturned record is a reflection of cases in which the Supreme Court ruled contrary to a lower court. The 80 percent Trump tweeted about was in reference to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals\u2019 record, and does not exactly apply to the district courts.", "The Supreme Court typically only hears 100 to 150 of the estimated 7,000 cases it\u2019s asked to review per year. At least four of the nine Supreme Court judges must agree to hear a case, which come from the 50 state courts and 13 federal appeals courts, known as circuit courts.", "The cases that the Supreme Court chooses to take on are often disputed among the lower courts, complex, and problematic, so there\u2019s a reasonable chance that the Supreme Court will decide that the lower court\u2019s decision was wrong.", "We previously looked at the 9th Circuit\u2019s record when Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity falsely claimed it was the most overturned in the country.", "Here\u2019s what we found then, using data from SCOTUSBlog\u2019s Supreme Court statistics archive on circuit scorecards.", "The Supreme Court reversed about 70 percent of cases it took between 2010-15.
