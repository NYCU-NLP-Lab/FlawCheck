In 1984, for example, the Democratic primary turned out about three times more voters than the Republican primary. Nonetheless, President Ronald Reagan won re-election with almost 60 percent of the popular vote.", "In the six elections where there were contests on both sides, the party with the higher primary voter turnout won the popular vote just three times. In 1976, 1992 and 2008, Democratic primary turnout surpassed that of the GOP nominating race, and the Democratic candidates won the general election.", "Here\u2019s a chart showing this, compiled with data from the Federal Election Commission and a few other sources.

Bush won the election with about 7 million more votes.", "And in 2000, about 3 million more voters turned out for the Republican primary, but George W. Bush lost the popular vote to Al Gore.

He pointed out that the Democrats, while not turning up at the primary polls in droves, are still highly engaged.", "\"Those numbers have got to be pleasing and there are good reasons why the Republicans will be able to leverage the turnout. But I don\u2019t think it means they\u2019re going to win,\" he said. \"I would have to agree with (Brooks) on this.\"", "Our ruling", "Brooks said, \"There\u2019s no correlation between primary turnout and wins in the fall in the last 11 elections.\"", "There were competitive primaries on both sides in six out of the past 11 elections.
