Follow our post-election coverage here.", "While tensions mounted over the presidential election results in early November 2020, former U.S. President Donald Trump campaign adviser Steve Bannon called for a second Trump term to kick off with some firings.", "During the Nov. 5, 2020, edition of the Breitbart News executive\u2019s podcast, \"War Room Pandemic,\" Bannon made jabs at National Institutes of Health (NIH) Director Dr. Anthony Fauci and FBI Director Christopher Wray and appeared to endorse violence against them when he said the following:", "Second term kicks off with firing Wray, firing Fauci.", "Now I actually want to go a step farther but I realize the president is a kind-hearted man and a good man.", "I'd actually like to go back to the old times of Tudor England, I'd put the heads on pikes, right, I'd put them at the two corners of the White House as a warning to federal bureaucrats. You either get with the program or you're gone -- time to stop playing games.", "By the following day, the video had been deleted from all of Bannon\u2019s official platforms, but was still floating around social media, including the below snippet shared on Twitter.", "A longer version of the podcast video was shared by Media Matters, a web-based, not-for-profit research and information center dedicated to monitoring misinformation in the U.S. Media. (The video has been archived here for reference.)", "A Twitter spokesperson confirmed to Snopes in an email sent Nov. 6 that, \"the @WarRoomPandemic account has been permanently suspended for violating the Twitter Rules, specifically our policy on the glorification of violence.\u201d The platform went on to add that statements made by Bannon went against policies in place that address clear threats of violence, abuse and harassment, and hateful conduct.", "As of Nov. 6, Bannon\u2019s official Facebook page and YouTube channel were both still available online, though it appeared that the video in question had since been deleted.

We will update the article accordingly if we hear back.", "Bannon and some of his followers have been described as \u201cTrump loyalists,\u201d and it was not uncommon for such groups to go after those whom the president had expressed dislike toward. While testifying in front of the U.S. House Homeland Security Committee on Sept. 17, Wray said that the FBI had \u201cnot seen, to date, a coordinated national voter fraud effort in a major election. We have certainly investigated \u2026 if I just may finish. We\u2019ve certainly have investigated a voter fraud committed by mail. It\u2019s typically been at the local level.\u201d", "When Wray appeared to question and place doubt in Trump\u2019s claims that mail-in ballots would lead to fraud in the 2020 general election, the administration publicly went after the former attorney.", "The Washington Post reported on Oct. 21 that Trump and his advisers had \u201crepeatedly discussed whether to fire\u201d Wray after Election Day because of his inability to produce incriminating evidence against Democratic candidate Joe Biden. In an Oct. 8 interview with Fox News Business, Trump furthered that Wray was \u201cdisappointing\u201d in that he didn\u2019t \u201csee the voting ballots as a problem.\u201d", "Trump has also publicly expressed dismay at the actions of Fauci, who spearheaded the COVID-19 pandemic response since March. In an editorial published by The Hill, opinion contributor Gregory Wallance wrote that Fauci \u201cgets in the way\u201d of Trump\u2019s economic revival strategy following unprecedented nationwide business closures by \u201ctelling Americans the truth about the pandemic.\u201d Since the onset of the pandemic, Fauci warned that the worst is yet to come, and urged local leaders to continue to heed the advice of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in spite of what the president said.", "During a campaign rally in Arizona in October, Trump made fun of Fauci, adding that he was a \u201cwonderful man\u201d but a \u201cbad arm\u201d (around the 15-minute mark).", "I saved thousands of lives. He admitted that two months later. Two months later. And Dr. Fauci said, \u201cDon\u2019t put on masks.\u201d You see the thing. And now, he says put on masks, and they say he\u2019s a wonderful guy, and he is a wonderful guy. I like him. He just happens to have a very bad arm. He has a bad arm, but he\u2019s a good guy. He is a good guy. A lot of our people don\u2019t like him. I like him. You have to understand him. He\u2019s a promoter. What can he do? And it\u2019s a choice between the American dream or a totally socialist nightmare. That\u2019s what you\u2019ll have. You\u2019ll be a socialist country. And I said, \u201cOur country will never be a socialist country. We\u2019re not going to let it happen.
