If you look at China and India, they're the greatest polluters in the world. Fifteen out of the 20 most polluted cities in the world are in one of those two countries. We need to solve this in a global way.

It was assembled by the World Health Organization in 2014.", "It compares cities based on how much fine particulate matter they have in the air. This measurement is called PM 2.5, standing for particulate matter that is 2.5 microns in width or smaller. (There are about 25,000 microns per inch, so these particles are very small.)", "Such pollutants at the ground level pose such immediate health risks as eye, nose, throat and lung irritation, and they can elevate the risk for lung and heart ailments over the longer term. These small particles typically come from exhaust from cars, trucks, buses and other vehicles, though they can also come from natural sources such as forest and grass fires.", "Here\u2019s the list:", "Rank", "CIty and country", "PM 2.5 pollution level", "1", "Delhi, India", "153", "2", "Patna, India", "149", "3", "Gwalior, India", "144", "4", "Raipur, India", "134", "5", "Karachi, Pakistan", "117", "6", "Peshawar, Pakistan", "111", "7", "Rawalpindi, Pakistan", "107", "8", "Khormabad, Iran", "102", "9", "Ahmedabad, India", "100", "10", "Lucknow, India", "96", "11", "Firozabad, India", "96", "12", "Doha, Qatar", "93", "13", "Kanpur, India", "93", "14", "Amritsar, India", "92", "15", "Ludhiana, India", "91", "16", "Idgir, Turkey", "90", "17", "Narayonganj, Bangladesh", "89", "18", "Allahbad, India", "88", "19", "Agra, India", "88", "20", "Khanna, India", "88", "So, 13 of the 20 cities on the most-polluted list are located in India (they\u2019re highlighted in bold).

This reflectiveness may have made the earth warm more slowly than it might otherwise have.", "That said, experts agreed that there\u2019s likely a reasonably high correlation between cities that have high particulate counts and those that have high emission levels for carbon dioxide, particularly when you look beyond advanced industrialized nations like the United States.", "While \"the two lists will not necessarily line up perfectly, the 20 most polluted cities are certainly also top contributors of carbon emissions,\" Soden said.", "And experts said that Webb does have a point about the need for international cooperation if carbon levels are to be cut. While the United States is a bigger carbon emitter right now, other nations like India are seeing their emissions rise more rapidly. Emissions are only going to fall worldwide if most major emitters reduce their output together.", "\"Yes, it is absolutely a global problem, but someone needs to lead,\" Soden said.", "Our ruling", "Webb said that \"15 out of the 20 most polluted cities in the world\" are in India and China.", "He\u2019s close -- 13 are in India, though none are in China.
