Kamala Harris, D-Calif., speaks at the Hotel DuPont in Wilmington, Del., Thursday, Aug. 13, 2020. (AP)", "\u2022 There is no evidence Sen. Kamala Harris ever said this.", "\u2022 When she was a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, Harris pledged to act on gun control within 100 days of being in office, but she did not say she would sign an executive order if elected that would force people to surrender their guns.", "\u2022 Other fact-checking organizations have debunked this claim.", "Sen. Kamala Harris has taken a strong stance on gun control, but has she actually threatened to send police to your house to take your guns?", "The short answer is no. But that hasn\u2019t stopped social media users from spreading a fabricated quote attributed to her that suggests otherwise.", "\"If elected & you don\u2019t surrender your guns, I will sign an executive order & the police will show up at your door,\" reads a post attributed to Harris, the newly selected running mate for presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden.", "Harris didn\u2019t say this. And there is no evidence Harris plans to force people to surrender their guns. The post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

What\u2019s more, a commitment to use \"executive action\" can refer to more than just executive orders, as the Washington Post reported.", "At another campaign event in August 2019 in Las Vegas, Harris reiterated her pledge to take action on guns within 100 days of taking office. At that event, she said she would also use executive action to implement \"a ban on the importation of assault rifles into our country.\"", "In a follow-up question, Harris was asked what enforcement of an assault rifles ban might look like. A reporter is heard off-camera asking, \"Does it involve law enforcement essentially going to people\u2019s houses looking for specific banned guns? Does it involve perhaps creating a database of people who are legal gun owners? What kind of process are we talking about here?\"", "Harris answered by referencing her experience as attorney general in California, when she said law enforcement was permitted to confiscate guns by going to the doors of people who were both \"found by a court to be a danger to themselves and others\" and were also \"on a list where they were precluded and prohibited from owning a gun because of a conviction.\"", "\"I have to stress, lawful gun ownership, that is one thing. We\u2019re talking about something else and we have to stop conflating and blending all these issues,\" Harris said.", "Harris did not say she planned to send law enforcement officers to the homes of all gun owners, as the post suggests.", "When we first spotted the false quote being shared Aug. 11 on a Facebook page called YET-iheart-NRA, PolitiFact reached out to the page administrator to ask what evidence they had to support the claim. Someone with the Facebook page responded, pointing us to an article from the blog Law Enforcement Today. That article referenced an exchange between Biden and Harris in the September 2019 Democratic presidential primary debate, found here.", "In it, debate moderator David Muir of ABC\u2019s World News Tonight pointed out that Harris said she planned to use executive action to ban imports of AR-15 assault weapons if Congress did not act quickly enough. Muir explained that Biden had expressed doubts about the future president\u2019s \"constitutional authority\" to ban assault weapons via executive order, which Harris had not committed to doing.", "When asked if Biden\u2019s stated concern had a point, Harris jokingly replied, \"I mean I would just say, \u2018Hey Joe, instead of saying no we can\u2019t, let\u2019s say yes we can.\u2019\" Here again, there is no evidence she made the statement that is being attributed to her. (The post made by YET-iheart-NRA appears to have been removed since we inquired about it.)", "Other fact-checking organizations debunked similar claims that circulated online in 2019, but Harris\u2019 new role as vice presidential candidate caused the claim to reemerge.
