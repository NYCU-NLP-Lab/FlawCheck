According to the Bimek SLV web site, the first clinical trials will be conducted later this year:", "The SLV has\u00a0not yet been officially approved. As with all medical devices, the SLV first has to undergo extensive clinical trials in which volunteers are tested to determine its effects and safety, before it can be modified\u00a0and released to the market. In addition, there are technical checks and the manufacturing certification, packaging, sterilisation and further matters are required in order to obtain a CE mark. Only then will the SLV be ready and released on the market.", "The Bimek SLV is a small valve that is fitted to the spermatic duct. The valve can then be closed or opened to regulate release of sperm cells. According to the web site, the procedure would only take about a half hour:", "Bimek SLV is a small valve fitted to the spermatic duct that can regulate the release of sperm cells. When the valve is closed the SLV\u2019s principle function is to obstruct the release of sperm cells during ejaculation. The result of this function is that the seminal fluid released is sterile. With the SLV you are able to regulate when you can procreate. After the valve is inserted, and after the waiting period, you will only be fertile when the valve is opened again.", "While the SLV could conceivably pass clinical trials with flying colors and quickly get approved by the FDA, some experts are skeptical about the device.", "Wolfgang B\u00fchmann, spokesman for the Professional Association of German Urologists, told the\u00a0Telegraph\u00a0that he had his doubts about the sperm switch. For one,\u00a0B\u00fchmann said that implanting a valve could scar the vas deferens, which would render the switch useless since sperm could still flow through even in the closed position.\u00a0B\u00fchmann also said that he feared that the valve could be become clogged if it was left in the \"closed\" position for too long:", "\u201cMy assessment is that implanting the valve could cause scarring where it meets the vas deferens.\"", "While it's true that a\u00a0\"sperm switch\" has been invented, this form of male contraception\u00a0has not been tested or approved by the FDA.\u00a0As of January 2016,\u00a0Clemens Bimek is the only man who has undergone\u00a0the procedure.", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
