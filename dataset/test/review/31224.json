["President Barack Obama, first lady Michelle Obama, daughters Malia and Sasha, and dog Bo in Bar Harbor, Maine, on July 17, 2010.", "Readers recently forwarded us an email that\u2019s been making the rounds for several years. Because it appears to have returned to heavy rotation, we decided to do a few fact checks from among its dozens of claims, all of which are critical of President Barack Obama.", "Here, we\u2019ll check the claim that Obama is paying a pretty penny in taxpayer money -- specifically $102,000 a year -- to keep a dog trainer on retainer. The White House didn't respond to our inquiry, but we were able to piece the story together on our own.", "Presidents have a long history of family pets, dating all the way back to George Washington, who kept dogs, horses and even a parrot. During his presidency, Theodore Roosevelt housed enough animals to run a small petting zoo on the south lawn, including 13 horses, six dogs, several cats, and even such exotic animals as a zebra.", "The Obama White House is certainly pet-friendly, but a little more tame: The Obamas have two Portuguese water dogs, Bo and Sunny. Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., gave Bo as a gift to the Obamas in 2009 (fulfilling one of the newly inaugurated president\u2019s campaign promises), and Sunny joined in August 2013.", "It\u2019s obvious that the family adores Bo, but do they spend more than $100,000 per year to have a dog handler at their beck and call?", "Suggestions that the Obamas were spending lavishly on Bo circulated at least as far back as 2010. That\u2019s when bloggers claimed that Bo had flown solo to Maine in a private jet when the family took a trip there, based on an article in a local newspaper, the Morning Sentinel, which had reported that Bo had arrived \"in a small jet before the Obamas\" along with \"the president's personal aide, Reggie Love.\"", "We and others debunked the claim that Bo flew on his own airplane. In reality, the airport in Waterville, Maine, could not accommodate Obama\u2019s usual airplane, so Obama and his staff flew into a different airport on separate jets, one of which carried several members of Obama\u2019s presidential staff and Bo.", "The Sentinel later issued a correction: \"Today's story about the arrival of the Obamas said the Obamas' dog and one aide arrived on a small jet before the First Family, but there were other occupants on the plane, including several other staffers.\"", "But this wasn\u2019t enough to stop pieces of the rumor from morphing into another outrageous claim about Bo.", "Some of these rumors focused on Love, who holds a job known informally as the presidential \"body man\" -- a position that combines aspects of scheduler, valet, and conversational partner. Love began to work for Obama in 2006 and served as the president\u2019s personal aide from 2009 until 2011. That meant that he was at Obama\u2019s side almost constantly.", "Because the Morning Sentinel listed Love as Bo\u2019s one and only traveling companion, some bloggers incorrectly assumed (or willfully spread the fiction) that his job was \"dog trainer.\" Meanwhile, a 2011 report to Congress confirmed that Love was paid $102,000 a year. Love\u2019s salary matches that listed in the chain email.", "But Love was far from a dog trainer. His job was to provide any necessary personal assistance and arrangements for the leader of the Free World. The notion that Obama was keeping a dog trainer on retainer for $102,000 a year is nonsense.", "In tracking Bo\u2019s history, we did find references to one trainer, Dawn Sylvia-Stasiewicz, who trained the dog before his introduction to the presidential lifestyle.", "Sylvia-Stasiewicz was known for training dogs who lived among Washington\u2019s politicians, including Kennedy\u2019s family, who took Bo to her before giving the dog to the Obamas. According to the Washington Post, the Kennedy\u2019s worked with Sylvia-Stasiewicz to determine \"whether the dog would be suitable for a very busy family with two young daughters.\" By her own admission, Sylvia-Stasiewicz was unaware that the dogs\u2019 final destination would be the White House.", "However, according to the \"Annual Reports to Congress on White House Staff,\" she was never paid by the Obama administration.", "Our Ruling", "The chain email said that \"Obama is the first president to keep a dog trainer on retainer for $102,000 a year at taxpayer expense.\" The claim stitches together a few pieces of accurate information in a way that makes them inaccurate.", "A dog trainer, Dawn Sylvia-Stasiewicz, has been associated with Bo, but she was used briefly and was never paid by the administration. Meanwhile, Reggie Love was an Obama aide who earned $102,000, but to the extent that dog handling took any of his time, it was a small fraction of his total duties, and \"dog handler\" certainly wasn\u2019t his title.", "We rate this claim Pants on Fire.", "Red Flag News, Updated: The Comprehensive List of Obama\u2019s Accomplishments As First Black President Of The United States Of America, Jan. 25, 2014", "Morning Sentinel, White House wanderers tour Acadia, by Rebekah Metzler, July 17, 2010", "Washington Post, Dawn Sylvia-Stasiewicz, trainer of Bo, the Obamas' White House dog, dies at 52, Jan. 14, 2011", "White House Historical Association, \"Top Dogs\" at the White House, accessed June 17, 2014", "Presidential Pet Museum, List of White House Pets, accessed June 17, 2014", "Presidential Pet Museum, List of U.S. Presidents, accessed June 17, 2014", "White House, 2011 Annual Report to Congress on White House Staff", "PolitiFact, The ObamaMeter: Get his daughters a puppy, by Bill Adair, April 13, 2009", "PolitiFact, Bloggers Claim Bo Flies His Own Plane, by Lukas Pleva, July 22, 2010", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
