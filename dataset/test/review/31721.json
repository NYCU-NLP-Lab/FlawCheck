When the cost of paying interest on the debt is added, the increase comes to $1.9 trillion.", "Did Cramer claim he would cut Social Security and Medicare in order to fund the tax plan?", "His words were not so clear cut.", "The Senate Majority PAC pointed to two interviews with Cramer two days before Trump signed the tax cuts into law.", "A caller asked Cramer the following question on the Rob Report on Dec. 20, 2017: \"It looks like the tax bill could result in a debt increase that could lead to cuts in Medicare and Social Security. Congressman Cramer, can you commit today to not cutting Social Security or Medicare in the future? Yes or no?\"", "Cramer responded, \"Well, the two are not related at all. That\u2019s been one of the scarier tactics of\u2014\"", "\"Well,\" the caller pressed, \"if we have debt increase, they might rationalize that we have to cut Medicare and Social Security.\"", "Cramer said the tax law would spur the economy and that the deficit was already an issue, but he added that reform to the social safety net was also necessary.", "\"We need to reform all of our programs, not just to make sure people keep them but to make sure they can be kept for the long haul because both Medicare and Social Security, as you talked about, are on a path to insolvency,\" Cramer said. \"So we need to shore up both of them, not to cut them, we need to shore them up for the long haul.\"", "Steve Ellis, Taxpayers for Common Sense vice president, said Cramer has a point.", "\"With or without the revenue loss from the tax law, the major entitlement programs were on an unsustainable trajectory,\" Ellis said. \"Changes or \u2018cuts\u2019 to Medicare and Social Security are not simply because of a $1.9 trillion deficit increase, which would \u2018only\u2019 be roughly $200 billion a year, when we\u2019re looking at a total deficit of $800 billion this year and $1 trillion annual deficits soon.\"", "This is a point Cramer has been making for years, before the tax law.", "\"Social Security ought to be preserved and made available as promised to seniors and soon-to-be seniors who have paid in with an expectation of receiving benefits,\" Cramer told the political website On the Issues on Oct. 30, 2012. \"We should implement a program to reform and save it for future generations. Included in the reforms should be means testing, raising retirement age and allowing workers to invest more of their own money.\"", "Cramer offered a slightly more clear plan for reform in order to make Medicare and Social Security more sustainable in another interview on Dec. 19, 2018, on Valley News Live\u2019s \"Point of View.\"", "\"Are you on board with this for entitlement reform in 2018?

If we don't deal with that, not only do we not deal with the debt if we don\u2019t deal with it, but the entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare are going to go broke.

The people at the 25-year-old generation might have a little different program than the people that are 75 today.\"", "Cramer suggests vague changes to the way age and need for government assistance is determined, both of which Chris Hayden, spokesman for the Senate Majority PAC, told us qualify as \"cuts\" to Medicare and Social Security.", "Vanessa Williamson, a governance fellow at Brookings with a focus on taxation, agreed with Hayden\u2019s characterization.", "\"It seems clear to me that from these remarks that Mr. Cramer is calling for benefit cuts, both by means testing the programs (i.e. reducing or eliminating benefits for non-poor people) and by increasing the age at which you qualify,\" Williamson said.", "Other experts said the phrasing gave Cramer more leeway.", "Ellis said the word \"cut\" could be interpreted as an elimination, which Cramer did not suggest.
