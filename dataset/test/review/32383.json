These people are taking pictures of your kids and then having a vehicle pull up and kidnap them, then send them to another country.", "Rumors of \"serial kidnappings\" in Collin County were one of several localized trafficking claims to circulate on social media (without much in the way of facts to back them)\u00a0in 2015 and 2016.", "In May 2015, a Facebook user caused a stir with a subsequently viral claim of kidnappers in an\u00a0Oklahoma Hobby Lobby store; in June 2015, Twitter users circulated tales of\u00a0sex slavery rings targeting college kids during\u00a0summer job interviews; in the\u00a0same month, an old\u00a0theme park abduction urban legend resurfaced; later that summer,\u00a0a harrowing\u00a0tale of\u00a0purported teenaged assailants drugging teens in\u00a0the bathroom of a Denton, Texas, Dillards department store proliferated on social sites; then a Hickory, North Carolina woman claimed\u00a0human trafficking rings\u00a0were menacing\u00a0the parking lots of Walmarts\u00a0in search of new victims; finally,\u00a0a Long Island Target was briefly cited as the stomping grounds\u00a0of similar kidnappers in August 2015.", "We contacted the Collin County Sheriff's Office and spoke to several people there,\u00a0none of whom were aware of even one such kidnapping in the jurisdiction.", "As with the prior claims, the rumors were\u00a0inconsistent with legitimate\u00a0reports\u00a0and law enforcement understanding of the mechanics of human\u00a0trafficking.
