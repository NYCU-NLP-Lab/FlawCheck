One of the commentators stated that the video is infact not from Bandipora, but from Uri town in Kashmir.", "Based on this comment, we searched Youtube for incidents of accidental fire in Uri. In our search, we came across a video with the title, \u201cFour residential houses were gutted in a massive fire incident at Lachipora Uri\u201c. This video was same as the one viral on social media, but rotated by ninety degress and with a higher definition.", "To further confirm the veractiy of our findings, Alt News contacted Peerzada Waseem, a photo journalist from Jammu and Kashmir to check if the visuals are familiar to him.

The fire first broke out in a cowshed and later spread to the houses in the vicinity. An article published by Rising Kashmir on March 27, 2018, stated, \u201cThe local residents, however, said that the fire completely destroyed the houses as there is no fire service station in the area. The nearest and only fire service station is at Uri town, some 18 kilometres away from Lachipora village.\u201d", "Thus, a video of an accident in Lachipora in Kashmir was passed off as Indian army burning houses in Bandipora, Kashmir and was shared aggressively in the Pakistani social media ecosystem. We have observed a pattern in which attempts are made to malign the Indian army in the Pakistani social media ecosystem through misleading social media campaigns. In the past as well, a training video of SSG commandos from Pakistan was shared by Pakistani journalists and media houses as of Kashmiri being tortured by the Indian army.", "[This article was updated on August 8, 2019.]", "Donate Now", "Jignesh is a writer and researcher at Alt News.
