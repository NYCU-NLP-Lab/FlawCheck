The FDA will now require sealed ice cream cartons. Yes, there will be a plastic skin tight seal on ice cream cartons now.

The plastic sealing material will now find its way to already stuffed Landfills thus taxing the garbage system even more. So remember when you see the seal on ice cream and a higher price it was her fault and her fault alone. This is what being a dumbass does to the rest of us who are not dumbasses.
