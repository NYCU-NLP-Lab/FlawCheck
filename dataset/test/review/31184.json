["President Donald Trump raised the specter of shady bureaucratic doings that allowed a whistleblower\u2019s complaint to move forward when ordinarily it wouldn\u2019t have.", "\"Who changed the long standing whistleblower rules just before submittal of the fake whistleblower report?\" Trump tweeted Sept. 30. \"Drain the swamp!\"", "WHO CHANGED THE LONG STANDING WHISTLEBLOWER RULES JUST BEFORE SUBMITTAL OF THE FAKE WHISTLEBLOWER REPORT? DRAIN THE SWAMP!", "Trump was far from the only one saying the rules were changed \"just before\" the report that ignited an impeachment inquiry was filed Aug. 12. House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy tweeted the same thing Sept. 28.", "\"Whistleblowers were required to provide direct, first-hand knowledge of allegations,\" McCarthy wrote. \"But just days before the Ukraine whistleblower came forward, the IC (Inspector General of the Intelligence Community) secretly removed that requirement from the complaint form.\" Trump\u2019s lawyer Rudy Giuliani echoed the same point Sept. 29.", "All three tweets lead back to the same article on the conservative website Federalist.", "All three are wrong.", "\u2022 First-hand knowledge by a whistleblower has never been required since the law protecting intelligence community whistleblowers was enacted.", "\u2022 Inspector General staff, who investigate a charge, need first-hand information to move a complaint forward \u2014 as they did in this case.", "\u2022 The current complaint was based on both first- and second-hand information.", "The Sept. 27 article claimed, \"Between May 2018 and August 2019, the intelligence community secretly eliminated a requirement that whistleblowers provide direct, first-hand knowledge of alleged wrongdoings.\"", "The evidence comes from a tweet thread started by Stephen McIntyre on the morning the Federalist article appeared. McIntyre is a former mining company director who created the Climate Audit blog, which questions the official data behind climate change.", "From the thread, a few key points emerge:", "As of May 24, 2018, the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community\u2019s Urgent Concern disclosure form \u2014 the form whistleblowers fill out\u00a0 \u2014 offered three choices to describe how the whistleblower got his/her information: personal knowledge, heard from other people, and other sources.", "The current form offers just two choices: personal knowledge or \"heard about it from others.\" That form dates from August 2019.", "The previous form also included a section under the subhead \"First-hand information required.\"", "\"In order to find an urgent concern \u2018credible,\u2019 the IC IG (Intelligence Community Inspector General) must be in possession of reliable, first-hand information. The IC IG cannot transmit information via the ICWPA (Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act) based on an employee\u2019s second-hand knowledge of wrongdoing. This includes information received from another person, such as when a fellow employee informs you that he/she witnessed some type of wrongdoing. (Anyone with first-hand knowledge of the allegations may file a disclosure in writing directly with the IC IG.) Similarly, speculation about the existence of wrongdoing does not provide sufficient basis to meet the statutory requirements of the ICWPA. If you think wrongdoing took place, but can provide nothing more than secondhand or unsubstantiated assertions, IC IG will not be able to process the complaint or information for submission as an ICWPA.\"", "The current reporting form lacks that section.", "Based on these facts, Trump and other Republicans asserted that the rules for whistleblowers were changed \"just before\" the current complaint was filed. Actually, only the forms were changed. The rules stayed the same.", "The whistleblower who triggered the impeachment inquiry filled out the earlier version of the form, and no rules were changed.", "The Office of Inspector General issued a statement Sept. 30 saying that \"the Disclosure of Urgent Concern form the Complainant submitted on August 12, 2019, is the same form the IC IG has had in place since May 24, 2018.\"", "The inspector general\u2019s office underscored that the whistleblower received the section about the need for first-hand evidence before a claim would go on to the next step.", "So changes to the form took place after the whistleblower filed.", "As for the rules on what is required, those have been the same since 2014 under an order issued by the Director of National Intelligence. Intelligence Community Directive 120 defines a protected disclosure as one that the employee \"reasonably believes evidences a violation of any law, rule or regulation.\"", "The statement from the Inspector General\u2019s office emphasized the reasonable belief standard.", "\"By law the Complainant \u2013 or any individual in the Intelligence Community who wants to report information with respect to an urgent concern to the congressional intelligence committees \u2013 need not possess first-hand information in order to file a complaint,\" the statement said. \"The IC IG cannot add conditions to the filing of an urgent concern that do not exist in law.\"", "The section about the need for first-hand information has to do with the investigation that follows a whistleblower\u2019s report, not a requirement for the report itself.", "\"This is their way of tempering the whistleblower\u2019s expectations,\" said analyst Irvin McCullough, with the nonprofit Government Accountability Project. (McCullough\u2019s father served as inspector general until 2017 and now represents the whistleblower.) \"It says we might not find enough to support your complaint.\"", "The latest IG statement says it changed its forms after the current affair unfurled, because it understood some parts \"could be read \u2014 incorrectly \u2014 as suggesting that whistleblowers must possess first-hand information in order to file an urgent concern complaint.\"", "The statement noted that the whistleblower checked both boxes to indicate he/she had both first and second-hand information.", "It also notes that its investigation found the report credible and urgent.", "The White House had no comment.", "Trump said, \"Longstanding whistleblower rules (were changed) just before submittal of the fake whistleblower report.\"", "The current rules have been in place since 2014. Whistleblowers can provide either first or second-hand information, or both. The current whistleblower filled out a form that dates from May 2018. Whatever changes existed on that form date from 14 months before the present claim was filed.", "Investigators require more than second-hand information in order to move a complaint forward, but that is not a requirement before a complaint can be filed.", "The Inspector General\u2019s office changed its forms after the whistleblower filed, but those changes had no bearing on the rules under which a claim would be processed.", "We rate this claim False.", "Donald Trump, tweet, Sept. 30, 2019", "Federalist, Intel Community Secretly Gutted Requirement Of First-Hand Whistleblower Knowledge, Sept. 27, 2019", "Office of Inspector General of the Intelligence Community, \u00a0Statement on Processing of Whistleblower Complaints, Sept. 30, 2019", "Office of Inspector General of the Intelligence Community, Urgent concern disclosure form, May 24, 2018", "Office of Inspector General of the Intelligence Community, Disclosure of urgent concern form, August 2019", "Office of the Director of National Intelligence, Intelligence Community Directive 120: Intelligence community whistleblower protection, March 20, 2014", "Stephen McIntyre, tweet, Sept. 27, 2019", "Kevin McCarthy, tweet, Sept. 28, 2019", "Rudy Giuliani, tweet, Sept. 29, 2019", "U.S. Congress, INTELLIGENCE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 1999, Oct. 20, 1998", "Office of the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community, Semi-annual report October 2017-March 2018, 2018", "Daily Beast, GOP Shows Russian Trolls How It\u2019s Done With Whistleblower Smear, Sept. 30, 2019", "Office of Inspector General of the Intelligence Community, Lawful IC Whistleblowing - October 2018, captured Oct. 25, 2018", "Interview, Irvin McCullough, security analyst, Government Accountability Project, Sept 30, 2019", "Email exchange, Sean Davis, co-founder, Federalist, Sept. 30, 2019", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
