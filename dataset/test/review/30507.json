At one point, he lamented the economic hardship in his city.", "The mayor distributed a list that showed the ratio of city poverty to suburban poverty in the nation\u2019s 51 largest metropolitan areas, those with a metro population above 1 million. Then he said of Milwaukee:", "\"We are the only metropolitan area in the entire country where you\u2019ve got that ratio higher than four, meaning that the poverty rate is four times greater in the city than it is in the suburbs. Only one. Only one.\"", "There\u2019s no question the city of Milwaukee has had some of the highest poverty rates in the country. Let\u2019s see if the measure Barrett uses -- a city-to-suburban poverty ratio -- is accurate.", "Barrett\u2019s numbers", "The list Barrett provided came from NewGeography.com, which is \"devoted to analyzing and discussing the places where we live and work.\" It was included with a July 2012 article by Wendell Cox of Demographia, a Belleville, Ill., public policy firm.", "Using 2010 census data, Cox provided a ratio to show how much greater the poverty rate is in the city vs. the suburbs in the 51 largest metro areas.", "For Milwaukee, the poverty rate was 29.5 percent in the city and 6.9 percent in the suburbs -- a ratio of 4.3. In other words, the city\u2019s poverty rate was 4.3 times higher than the suburban rate.", "And, as Barrett said, Milwaukee was the only large metro area with a ratio above 4.", "The three next-highest ratios behind Milwaukee, along with the city poverty rate vs. the suburban rate were:", "Metro area", "City poverty rate", "Suburban rate", "Ratio", "Hartford, Conn.", "31.2%", "7.8%", "3.99", "Baltimore", "25.6%", "6.7%", "3.80", "Rochester, N.Y.", "33.8%", "9.3%", "3.62", "Newer numbers", "Nearly a week before Barrett made his claim, the U.S. Census bureau released new poverty figures -- for 2012.

The report didn\u2019t list ratios like those in the report Barrett had cited.", "But a simple calculation of Brookings\u2019 city and suburban poverty rates shows that both the Milwaukee and Hartford, Conn., metro areas had a poverty ratio above 4:", "Metro area", "City poverty rate", "Suburban rate", "Ratio", "Hartford, Conn.", "38%", "7.9%", "4.81", "Milwaukee", "29.9%", "7.3%", "4.10", "Our rating", "Barrett said that among the nation\u2019s 51 largest metropolitan areas, Milwaukee is the \"only one\" where the poverty rate is more than \"four times greater in the city than it is in the suburbs.\"", "Barrett was correct in citing 2010 census figures showing Milwaukee was the only large metro area with a poverty ratio above 4, but his claim went a bit too far in that the just-released 2012 figures show two areas with that ratio.
