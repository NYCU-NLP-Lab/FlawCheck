Are some players asking the league to host a month of anti-police activism? Will Fox Sports stop airing NFL games?", "A: No. Three of those stories were made-up, and one is a gross misrepresentation.", "Facebook has been flush with stories about the National Football League since President Donald Trump called on team owners to fire any player who \u201cdisrespects our flag\u201d by making political demonstrations on the field during the national anthem.", "The president\u2019s appeal drew criticism from the league\u2019s commissioner, Roger Goodell \u2014 who called for a \u201csense of unity\u201d \u2014 and various teams and players, who mostly either locked arms, took a knee or stayed off the field as the anthem played prior to games on Sept. 24 and 25.", "However, several of the stories that have been circulated widely, and flagged as potentially fake news on Facebook, are not true.", "Claim: The NFL fined Steelers players who weren\u2019t on the sidelines for the anthem.", "Flagged on: The Last Line of Defense, World News, The Trumppers and others.", "More than a dozen websites posted a bogus story claiming the league fined the Pittsburgh Steelers $1 million for every player who wasn\u2019t present for the national anthem.", "Prior to the game against the Chicago Bears, Pittsburgh Steelers coach Mike Tomlin announced that his team would remain off the field for the anthem so that players wouldn\u2019t have to decide whether to stand or take a knee.", "\u201cIt was a bad decision,\u201d says the story that originated at thelastlineofdefense.org. \u201cNFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, who donated to Donald Trump\u2019s election campaign, announced shortly after the game began that every player who \u2018protested\u2019 the National Anthem and showed \u2018immense disrespect to our nation\u2019 would be fined a cool million dollars.\u201d", "However, no such fine has been imposed, Brian McCarthy, vice president for corporate communications at the NFL, confirmed to FactCheck.org. Goodell also didn\u2019t contribute to Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, according to Federal Election Commission records.", "The story was completely fabricated.", "A disclaimer on the thelastlineofdefense.org says: \u201cAmerica\u2019s Last Line of Defense is a satirical publication that may sometimes appear to be telling the truth.

However, it doesn\u2019t ask the league to engage in anti-police activism.", "Instead, the memo urges the league to use November \u201cto serve as a month of Unity for individual teams to engage and impact the community in their market.\u201d", "Specifically, that would mean addressing issues of economic growth, education and police and community relations \u2014 which would emphasize work that some players have already begun by doing ride-alongs with police, partnering with officers to participate in players\u2019 community-related projects (like camps, events, and outreach), and town hall meetings to discuss issues facing the black community and come up with solutions.", "FactCheck.org Rating:", "Claim: The Cleveland Browns fired a player for kneeling during the anthem.", "Flagged on: The Last Line of Defense, 365 US news and The USA Conservative.", "This fake story claims that the Cleveland Browns fired one of its linebackers for taking a knee during the national anthem.", "\u201cJerry Haslam,\u201d the team\u2019s alleged owner, according to the story, is quoted saying: \u201cI felt powerless to fire them before\u2026 But now that I know my President is behind me, I will gladly fire every player who does this, starting with [Franklin] Lewis.\u201d", "But the team\u2019s real owners are Jimmy and Dee Haslam, and no one named Franklin Lewis plays for the Browns.", "The actual statement released by the Haslams on Sept. 24 said, in part: \u201cWe must not let misguided, uninformed and divisive comments from the President or anyone else deter us from our efforts to unify.
