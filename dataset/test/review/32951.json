Let\u2019s revisit the facts.", "The \"most truant\" award goes to Rubio if we\u2019re looking at the past year.

Rubio remains fully engaged in the issues important to Florida and helping Floridians, and as he travels the country to talk about his agenda to help the middle class, there will be no doubt where he stands on any important issues before the Senate.\"", "Overall attendance", "Cruz and Rubio, as of March 3, both have a career absentee rate of 14.8 percent.", "Senator", "Votes missed (career)", "Absentee rate", "Cruz", "152 out of 1,026", "14.8 percent", "Rubio", "224 out of 1,512", "14.8 percent", "Hillary Clinton (D-N.Y., 2001-2009)", "249 out of 2,616", "9.5 percent", "Sanders", "131 out of 2,865", "4.6 percent", "But beyond the current field, neither Cruz or Rubio are the worst-ever offenders, according to a May 2015 Washington Post analysis.", "For example, President Barack Obama missed 24.2 percent of votes in his brief Senate career.
