["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "Newark Mayor Cory Booker drew national attention last week for criticizing a campaign ad from President Barack Obama, but even praising the president was problematic for the Brick City leader.\n\nBefore weighing in on the campaign ad, Booker argued May 20 in a roundtable discussion on NBC\u2019s \"Meet The Press\" that Obama needs to remind Americans of his accomplishments, such as overseeing the lowest level of discretionary spending in decades.\n\n\"First of all, I think it\u2019s a race for President Obama to remind the American public (of) the kind of things he\u2019s been doing and stop letting the other side steal his narrative,\" said Booker, a Democrat and a representative for the Obama campaign. \"He\u2019s a guy that\u2019s cut taxes on small business, the lowest discretionary spending we\u2019ve had in decades in the United States.\"\n\nIt\u2019s actually the other way around, PolitiFact New Jersey found.\n\nAs a percentage of gross domestic product -- which is a measure of the nation\u2019s economy -- discretionary spending under Obama reached its highest level in about two decades, according to figures released by the White House\u2019s Office of Management and Budget.\n\nDiscretionary spending is projected to drop to a level not seen at any point in the last several decades, but that would not occur for a few more years.\n\nBooker spokeswoman Anne Torres acknowledged that the mayor\u2019s statement was wrong.\n\n\"You\u2019re correct,\" Torres told us. \"He misspoke.\"\n\nFirst, let\u2019s explain discretionary spending.\n\nThere are two main categories of federal spending: discretionary and mandatory. Discretionary spending is controlled by lawmakers through annual appropriation acts. Mandatory spending is generally based on program parameters, such as those for Social Security and Medicare, without specific amounts being appropriated each year.\n\nDiscretionary spending represents nearly 40 percent of all federal outlays, and is comprised of defense and non-defense items.\n\nOver the last decade, military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan have largely contributed to the growth in defense spending, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Non-defense spending has increased during Obama\u2019s tenure, in part, because of the stimulus bill he approved in February 2009, the budget office said.\n\nSince Booker\u2019s claim refers to discretionary spending in general, we\u2019ll look at the total amount.\n\nIn fiscal year 2010 -- Obama\u2019s first complete fiscal year as president -- discretionary spending hit 9.4 percent of GDP, marking the highest amount since fiscal year 1987. In fiscal year 2011, which ended last September, discretionary spending dropped to 9 percent.\n\nBefore fiscal years 2010 and 2011, discretionary spending had not reached 9 percent since fiscal year 1991.\n\nIn a deal to raise the nation\u2019s debt ceiling, Obama and Congress agreed last summer to set caps on certain types of future discretionary spending. Due in large part to those caps, discretionary spending is projected to reach historic lows in the years ahead.\n\nAccording to the White House, discretionary spending would fall to 5.9 percent of GDP in fiscal year 2016, marking the lowest level since at least the early 1960s. The Congressional Budget Office has offered slightly different estimates, placing discretionary spending at 6.5 percent in fiscal year 2016 and 5.9 percent in fiscal year 2019.\n\nOur ruling\n\nIn his May 20 appearance on NBC\u2019s \"Meet The Press,\" Booker cited a couple of Obama\u2019s accomplishments, including \"the lowest discretionary spending we\u2019ve had in decades in the United States.\"\n\nBut during Obama\u2019s tenure, discretionary spending hit 9 percent of GDP for the first time in about two decades. Discretionary spending is projected to drop significantly in the years ahead, but Booker made it sound like that had already occurred.\n\nWe rate the statement False.", "To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.", "The Star-Ledger, Newark Mayor Cory Booker slams Obama campaign ad, defends private equity firm Romney worked at on 'Meet the Press', May 20, 2012\n\nMeet The Press, Roundtable Discussion, May 20, 2012\n\nMeet The Press, Transcript of Roundtable Discussion, May 20, 2012\n\nPolitiFact, Obama says domestic spending headed to lowest level since Eisenhower, Feb. 16, 2011\n\nCongressional Budget Office, Testimony before the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, U.S. Congress, Oct. 26, 2011\n\nCongressional Budget Office, The U.S. Federal Budget: A Closer Look at Discretionary Spending, April 2012\n\nCongressional Budget Office, Updated Budget Projections: Fiscal Years 2012 to 2022, March 2012\n\nWhite House Office of Management and Budget, Fiscal Year 2013 Budget: Cutting Waste, Reducing the Deficit, and Asking All to Pay Their Fair Share, accessed May 21, 2012\n\nWhite House Office of Management and Budget, Historical Tables, accessed May 21, 2012\n\nFactCheck.org, Obama Bungles Budget Line, Feb. 23, 2011\n\nCongressional Budget Office, Discretionary Spending Under the Budget Control Act of 2011, Aug. 8, 2011\n\nCongressional Budget Office, The Budget and Economic Outlook: Fiscal Years 2012 to 2022, January 2012\n\nPolitiFact, Barack Obama says debt ceiling deal lowers domestic spending to lowest level since Eisenhower, Aug. 2, 2011\n\nE-mail interview with Jason Peuquet, The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, May 21, 2012\n\nPhone and e-mail interviews with Anne Torres, spokeswoman for Mayor Cory Booker, May 21-23, 2012", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
