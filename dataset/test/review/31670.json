["About this rating", "For several years as of this writing, stories have circulated on the internet about an odd, perhaps comical idea: a machine that spins a woman in circles, thus using centrifugal force to aid in childbirth. For example, in 2011, the feminist blog Jezebel reported:", "The sole purpose of the \"APPARATUS FOR FACILITATING THE BIRTH OF A CHILD BY CENTRIGUGAL FORCE\" (AFFTBOACBCF, perhaps, for short?) is as such:", "\"to provide an apparatus which will assist the under-equipped woman by creating a gentle, evenly distributed, properly directed, precision-controlled force, that acts in unison with and supplements her own efforts.\"", "GENTLE?!

A patent for the so-called \"Apparatus for Facilitating the Birth of a Child By Centrifugal Force\" was granted to New York residents George and Charlotte Blonsky on Nov. 9, 1965. The purpose of the device was to provide \"gentle\" aid to a woman in giving birth by swirling her around fast enough to create enough force to help propel the baby out.", "A rather not-gentle-looking sketch of a nude woman strapped spread-legged into a large piece of machinery accompanied the patent.", "Jefferson, Whitney.\u00a0\"Can We Interest You in a 'Centrifugal Birthing Machine?'\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Jezebel.\u00a01 June 2011.", "Keller, Jared.\u00a0\"Old, Very Weird Tech: An Apparatus for Centrifugal Birthing.\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a0The Atlantic.\u00a05 October 2011.", "Bethania Palma is a journalist from the Los Angeles area who started her career as a daily newspaper reporter and has covered everything from crime to government to national politics.
