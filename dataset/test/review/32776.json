["The claim was published in\u00a0this\u00a0Facebook post\u00a0on February 16, 2020, alongside a photo of a copy of this Ministry of Health advisory on preventing novel coronavirus.", "Below is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:", "The post\u2019s Hindi-language caption translates to English as: \u201cThe festival of Holi will be celebrated on March 10, where Chinese made items like toy guns, colours, face mask, artificial hair are used heavily. Today, hundreds of thousands of Chinese are affected by Coronavirus. In India, only a couple of cases have been found and in view of the Holi festival, please boycott these Chinese items to safeguard your family and children. Please tell local dealers to avoid buying these items from China. Stay alert, share this message widely and make it viral across India.\u201d", "Holi is an Indian festival\u00a0that signifies the start of spring and is often celebrated by covering people in colored powder.", "As of February 26, 2020, the novel coronavirus\u00a0has killed over 2,700\u00a0people and infected more than 80,000 in 34 countries, the vast majority of whom\u00a0are in China, AFP reported.", "A similar claim was also shared in posts\u00a0here, here, here and here on Facebook and here and here on Twitter.", "This claim is misleading; a regional WHO representative said that the virus does not last long on surfaces of objects, so it is unlikely that imported goods would remain infectious on arrival to India.", "\u201cResearch as far as we know seems to indicate that the virus does not survive for very long on objects. For toys, the risk is only if the toy is contaminated with the virus and for the toy to be contaminated there are special conditions. So it is very unlikely that a toy will be contaminated with the virus simply because it was manufactured in China,\"\u00a0the WHO's\u00a0representative for India, told AFP by phone\u00a0on February 24, 2020.", "The WHO\u00a0also issued a similar advisory here on their website that says it is \u201csafe\u201d to receive goods from China.", "\u201cPeople receiving packages from China are not at risk of contracting the new coronavirus.
