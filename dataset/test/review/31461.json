But the worst in the nation? Elaine Phillips says that\u2019s the case. The Republican is running for a vacant State Senate seat on Long Island, and she has made public corruption in Albany the centerpiece of her campaign.", "She outlined her plan for state ethics reform in a Facebook post, in which she claimed New York State leads the nation in lawmakers in trouble with the law.", "\"Over the past decade in Albany, more than 30 current and former state officeholders have been convicted, sanctioned or accused of wrongdoing \u2014 more than any other state,\" Phillips said in the post. She referenced the number from an article in the New York Times. Phillips took that\u00a0claim a step further by saying New York led the pack in corruption among other states.", "In Albany, running afoul of the law is bipartisan, and not just for backbenchers. Two of the state\u2019s legislative leaders were convicted of corruption charges, former Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, and former Senate Majority Leader Dean Skelos, a Long Island Republican.", "Phillips, mayor of the Nassau County village of Flower Hill, faces Adam Haber, a Democrat who most recently served with the Nassau Interim Finance Authority Board, which monitors the county\u2019s finances.", "So is Phillips right?

They tracked bribery, influence peddling and theft of public funds among other charges.", "Other studies have looked solely at federal convictions or public officials at all levels of government.
