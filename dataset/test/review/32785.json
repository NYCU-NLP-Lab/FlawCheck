["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "As President Barack Obama toured Virginia last week touting his jobs plan, Republicans countered that his previous effort -- the stimulus -- did not create a single job.\n\nThe National Republican Senatorial Committee posted a web ad\u00a0inking Obama and former Gov. Tim Kaine, who served as the president\u2019s hand-picked chairman of the Democratic National Committee from 2009 until early this year. Kaine resigned the post when he announced he would run for the U.S. Senate next year.\n\nThe 31-second NRSC ad has footage of Kaine strongly endorsing the president and predicting the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 \"will save or create 2.4 million jobs.\"\nThree people appear in quick order on the screen, saying, \"Zero jobs, zero jobs, zero jobs were created.\"\n\nZilch?\n\nWe thought we\u2019d look into this familiar claim once again, noting that Republican George Allen, Kaine\u2019s likely opponent in next year\u2019s U.S. Senate race, is featuring the ad on his campaign web site\u00a0and sent out a \u00a0tweet\u00a0heralding it.\n\nChris Bond, press secretary for the NRSC, told us the zero-jobs claim is not about the stimulus. \"The part of the ad you\u2019re referring to clearly shows news clips about unemployment reports\" by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, he said in an email.\n\nBut we think anyone seeing the ad would conclude the zero-jobs claim is tied to the stimulus. The commercial makes no apparent reference to unemployment reports. It clearly mentions the stimulus, however.", "PolitiFact is no stranger to claims that the Recovery Act was a complete dud. In June, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-7th, received a \u00a0False\u00a0rating on his claim that the stimulus \"failed to get people back to work.\" His office argued it was a broad statement that the Recovery Act failed to improve the economy, not a claim that no one benefited from it.\n\nEchoing Cantor, the NRSC\u00a0\u00a0later in June put out a news release saying the stimulus \"failed to create jobs,\" and that also received a \u00a0False\u00a0rating from PolitiFact.\n\nTexas Gov. Rick Perry said during a Republican presidential debate Sept. 12, 2011, that the stimulus \"created zero jobs.\" He earned a Pants on Fire\u00a0from our national PolitiFact colleagues.\n\nThere was also smoke in the air after U.S. Sen. Scott Brown, R-Mass., said in February 2010 that the stimulus \"didn\u2019t create one new job,\"\u00a0and after Florida Republican Rick Scott claimed in September 2010 while successfully campaigning for governor that the stimulus \"has not created one private sector job.\" \n\nThe zero-job claim is not credible for a simple reason: The stimulus did put people to work.\n\nVirginia\u2019s public schools and higher education institutions have reported the Recovery Act allowed them to create 996 jobs through the end of June 2011 and save 6,042 positions, according to Charles Pyle, communications director for the state Department of Education.\n\nThe White House has posted on its stimulus website\u00a0a listing of jobs funded by the stimulus, breaking it down by state and congressional district. For the quarter that ended June 30, the nation had reported 545,262 full-time equivalent jobs funded by the Recovery Act -- including 11,604 in Virginia..\n\nThe president\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, in a report\u00a0released in March, estimated that between 2.5 million and 3.6 million jobs were created or saved by the stimulus through the fourth quarter of 2010.\n\nSeparately, the council\u2019s report cited four independent analyses by the Congressional Budget Office and three private economic analysis companies. Here\u2019s what the groups found:\n\n\u2022 CBO: Between 1.3 million and 3.6 million jobs saved or created.\n\n\u2022 IHS/Global Insight: 2.45 million jobs saved or created.\n\n\u2022 Macroeconomic Advisers: 2.3 million jobs saved or created.\n\n\u2022 Moody\u2019s Economy.com: 2.5 million jobs saved or created.\n\nOur ruling:\n\nThe stimulus may not have been the success everyone hoped for, but there\u2019s an abundance of evidence it did create jobs and saved many more. Just look at the figures from the Virginia Department of Education.\n\nThe NRSC added its name to a list of Republican candidates who claim the the stimulus created \"zero jobs.\"\u00a0\u00a0When we asked for proof, the campaign organization provided none. Instead, a spokesman said the ad \"clearly\" referred to federal unemployment reports -- not the Recovery Act. We don't buy that explanation; the commercial is undoubtedly focused on the stimulus.", "Not one job anywhere?
