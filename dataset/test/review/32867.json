["The title of the Facebook post published on March 5, 2021, reads: \u201cA Missing Plane From 1955 Landed After 37 Years. Here\u2019s What Happened.\u201d", "The text is accompanied by a video that claims Pan Am Flight 914 took off from New York in 1955, slipped from radar\u00a0and then vanished, until its unexplained return\u00a037 years later when it landed in Miami, Florida.", "The story originated in\u00a0an article published in May 1985 in the Weekly World News, an American print-based tabloid that was in circulation between 1979 and 2007. It relaunched online in 2009.", "However, the story of Pan Am Flight 914, much like other tales published by The Weekly World News, is bogus.", "Snopes previously debunked the story in 2019, the same year that a YouTube page called \u201cBright Side\u201d breathed new life into the myth when it published a viral video\u00a0that has been viewed more than 19.2 million times.", "Even the video itself casts doubt, with the\u00a0narrator noting after seven minutes of rehashing the claim that \u201cthe story just seems to be an elaborate fabrication\u201d.", "The Weekly World News published its story twice more (here and here)\u00a0in the years that followed, using two different photographs of two different men named as\u00a0\u201ceyewitness\u201d air traffic controller, Juan de la Corte.", "A reverse image search shows that the picture of the plane used by the Weekly World News is actually a stock photograph\u00a0on Alamy of a DC-4\u00a0 sporting the livery of rival airline TWA\u00a0in about 1935.", "And not only are there no credible news reports to support the claim, but there is also no mention of the flight in the US department of transport\u2019s records of investigations\u00a0into aircraft accidents from 1934 to 1965.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
