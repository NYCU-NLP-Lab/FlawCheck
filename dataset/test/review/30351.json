["By Eugene Kiely and D'Angelo Gore", "Posted on October 25, 2018", "Editor\u2019s Note: For weeks, President Donald Trump has been campaigning in states that are key to the Republican Party\u2019s chances of maintaining control of the House and Senate. We have reviewed seven speeches he gave from Oct. 10 to Oct. 22. This is the first in a series of stories on his speeches.", "President Donald Trump is trying to make illegal immigration a key issue in the midterm elections. In Montana, which borders Canada, Trump tells supporters that \u201cit\u2019s going to be an election of the caravan,\u201d referring to the several thousand Central American emigrants who are traveling to Mexico and the U.S. in search of refugee status.", "In seeking to motivate his supporters to vote Republican, Trump makes\u00a0wildly inaccurate and baseless immigration claims about the \u201cradical\u201d Democrats \u2014 a term he used 38 times in seven speeches (36 times in referring to Democrats and twice in referring to \u201cIslamic terrorists\u201d).", "Trump warns his supporters that the \u201cradical Democrat mob\u201d has become the \u201cparty of crime\u201d and wants to \u201cthrow your borders wide open to deadly drugs and ruthless gangs.\u201d He accuses the Democrats \u2013 without evidence \u2013 of funding the migrant caravan, and falsely claims they want to give \u201cillegal immigrants the right to vote.\u201d", "His claims about the Democrats have become increasingly exaggerated. In Arizona, he jokes, \u201cNext thing you know, they want to buy them a car.\u201d And then he states, as a fact, the next day in Nevada: \u201cThey want to give them cars.\u201d", "Here we look at some of the false, misleading and unsupported claims the president has made about immigration in seven speeches over 12 days, from Erie, Pennsylvania, to Missoula, Montana.", "To a predictable chorus of boos, Trump makes the baseless claim that Democrats \u201cwant to give illegal immigrants the right to vote.\u201d", "Trump, Nevada, Oct. 20: That\u2019s why Democrats want to give illegal immigrants the right to vote. I\u2019ll tell you, we\u2019ll go down fighting for that one. Can you imagine? People \u2014 you know, the vote was always so sacred. Now you see these things where they want the right to vote. They want the right to vote. There\u2019s one town in California where they want to take over the \u2014 illegal immigrants want to take over the control of the board that runs the town, all illegal immigrants. And, you know, you would think they\u2019re kidding. Seriously, would you even believe this? And they are serious.", "It is against the law for noncitizens to vote in federal elections, and the Democratic leadership in the House and Senate have not proposed to change that.", "At the local level, voters in San Francisco approved a measure in 2016 that will allow noncitizen residents with children to vote in school board elections. The city council of College Park, Maryland, also came close in 2017 to allowing noncitizen residents to vote in citywide elections, but the measure didn\u2019t receive enough votes to pass.", "That still isn\u2019t evidence of a national or even statewide push to allow immigrants in the country illegally to vote. We also aren\u2019t aware of a California town where the board members are \u201call illegal immigrants,\u201d and the White House did not identify one when we asked.", "In 2015, Jhonny Pineda, a Huntington Park, California, council member, who is now mayor, appointed two of the city\u2019s longtime residents, who are both living in the U.S. illegally, to two city commissions. Pineda issued\u00a0a statement\u00a0that said the men, Julian Zatarain and Francisco Medina, \u201care eligible to serve on the city commissions as long as it is solely volunteer work and both individuals do not receive financial benefits from the city.\u201d", "Zatarain was appointed to the Parks and Recreation Commission and Medina was appointed to the Health and Education Commission. Those are just two of the city\u2019s six commissions that advise the five-person city council on a number of issues.", "It was\u00a0in Nevada,\u00a0too, where Trump fabricated the claim that Democrats want to give \u201cillegal immigrants\u201d cars.", "A staple of the president\u2019s stump speech is his distorted tale of\u00a0Sayfullo Saipov \u2014 the\u00a0Uzbekistan national who has been charged with killing eight people when he drove his truck into a crowd of pedestrians, bicyclists and joggers along the Hudson River in New York City\u00a0on Oct. 31, 2017, according to the\u00a0indictment.", "In speeches on Oct. 22 in Texas, Oct. 19 in Arizona and Oct. 13 in Kentucky, the president claims \u2014 without evidence \u2014 that Saipov used \u201cchain migration\u201d to bring 22 relatives to the United States.\u00a0There\u2019s no evidence that Saipov brought even one relative to the country.", "Trump, Kentucky, Oct. 13: He came in, and then he took chain migration, and he brought his mother, and his father, and his brother, and his sister, and his aunt, and his grandfather. None of them working. It ended up being approximately 22 people who came in. It\u2019s called a chain. Isn\u2019t that wonderful? A chain.", "Trump, Texas, Oct. 22:\u00a0So he has 22 people that came in, because he\u2019s here. So he\u2019s here, it\u2019s called chain, a chain, nice name, chain migration. He\u2019s here. His mother comes with him, his father then comes, his uncle, his aunt, his brother, his nephew, his sister. 22 people. No jobs. Just 22 people.", "Trump is referring to a family-based immigration program that allows U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents, or green-card holders, to sponsor family members for permanent U.S. residency \u2014 as First Lady Melania Trump did in sponsoring her parents, who later became naturalized U.S. citizens. Melania Trump became a U.S. citizen in 2006.", "But there is no evidence that\u00a0Saipov brought any family members to the U.S.\u00a0Trump claims that Saipov\u2019s \u201cmother comes with him, his father then comes,\u201d but that\u2019s not true.\u00a0Saipov\u2019s father and mother \u2014 Habibullo Saipov and Muqaddas Saipova \u2014 were living in Uzbekistan at the time of the attack, as reported by the Daily Mail and\u00a0the Wall Street Journal.", "Princeton University Professor\u00a0Marta Tienda, a demographer who has studied family sponsorship,\u00a0called Trump\u2019s claim an \u201cimplausible exaggeration\u201d when\u00a0we wrote\u00a0about it earlier this year.", "As we wrote in April, Saipov arrived in the U.S. through the\u00a0Diversity Immigrant Visa Program\u00a0in 2010, and he was a green-card holder, or legal permanent resident, at the time of the attack, according to state and federal officials. Green-card holders \u201cmay petition for certain family members to immigrate to the United States as permanent residents,\u201d according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. But those \u201ccertain family members\u201d include only a spouse and children. Saipov married after he came to the United States, so it is possible he did not sponsor any family members. DHS has declined to comment, citing privacy laws, and Saipov\u2019s court-appointed attorney did not respond to our request for information.", "At his rallies, Trump routinely mocks the\u00a0Diversity Immigrant Visa Program as a \u201cvisa lottery,\u201d falsely claiming that other countries abuse the visa program \u201cto dispose of their problems,\u201d as he said in Texas.", "Trump,\u00a0Texas, Oct. 22:\u00a0That\u2019s why they support visa lottery. You know what visa lottery is? Countries put names in a batch and you pick \u2019em. You pick \u2019em. You keep picking them. And then you got nothing but problems, because you think those countries are putting their finest? I don\u2019t think so. It\u2019s a great way to dispose of their problems. Visa lottery.", "Trump, Ohio, Oct. 12:\u00a0Right now, we have a system, lottery, a lottery. Think of it, lottery. Oh, pick \u2019em, I wonder? What people do you think these countries are putting in? Do you think they\u2019re putting in their finest? I don\u2019t think so. I don\u2019t think so. So we\u2019re going to end it.", "Trump grossly misrepresents\u00a0the\u00a0Diversity Immigrant Visa Program, which uses a computer lottery system to randomly issue up to 50,000 immigrant visas each year to qualified applicants from countries with low rates of immigration to the United States.", "As we wrote\u00a0last year, the visa applicants \u2014 not their governments \u2014 submit the applications to the U.S. Also, the applicants are vetted by numerous U.S. agencies and officials \u2014 as are those applying for other visa programs.", "Eligible diversity visa applicants\u00a0must demonstrate\u00a0to the U.S. that they have a high school education or its equivalent or \u201ctwo years of work experience within the past five years in an occupation that requires at least two years of training or experience to perform.\u201d\u00a0There are more than a\u00a0dozen grounds\u00a0of inadmissibility, including health issues, criminal activity, national security concerns and the \u201clikelihood of becoming a public charge,\u201d meaning \u201ca person who is primarily dependent on the government for subsistence.\u201d", "\u201cThe diversity lottery is a true lottery,\u201d Stephen W. Yale-Loehr, who teaches immigration law at Cornell Law School, told us for our previous story. \u201cThere is no way a foreign government can game the lottery to offload the worst of their citizenry.\u201d", "As we mentioned earlier, Trump portrays the Democratic Party as being taken over by \u201cradicals\u201d who want to \u201cabolish ICE\u201d and \u201chave open borders.\u201d In Ohio, Trump said, \u201cThe new platform of the Democrat Party is to abolish ICE.\u201d In Texas, he said, \u201cThey\u2019re for open borders, which means crime, and for massive tax cuts.\u201d", "But, as we wrote,\u00a0Democrats are not advocating open borders. Yes, some liberal Democrats have called for abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement \u2014 angered by the administration\u2019s \u201czero tolerance policy,\u201d which caused the separation of children and parents crossing the border illegally. But these rank-and-file Democrats \u2014 not the party leaders \u2014 have also called for transferring many of ICE\u2019s functions to other government agencies. Rep. Mark Pocan of Wisconsin sponsored a bill \u2014 \u201cEstablishing a Humane Immigration Enforcement System Act\u201d \u2014 that would do just that. It has eight cosponsors.", "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi have both called for the immigration functions to be restructured and not abolished. \u201cNo one can watch ICE play such a central role in the heartbreak and horror of family separation without reasonably concluding that a drastic overhaul of its immigration functions is desperately needed, and soon,\u201d\u00a0Drew Hammill, Pelosi\u2019s spokesman, said in a statement.", "In his speeches, the president also falsely blames the Obama administration for the rise of the transnational gang Mara Salvatrucha, or MS-13, in the United States, and exaggerates his efforts to deport gang members.", "Trump, Ohio, Oct. 12: These towns are being liberated of the MS-13 garbage that came into our country. Under the previous administration, by the way. And they came in by the tens of thousands \u2014 well, we have set every record on getting them out.", "Trump, Texas, Oct. 22:\u00a0They came in through the wonderful Obama administration. We removed thousands and thousands of these people.", "The fact is MS-13, which is a\u00a0\u201cprimarily El Salvadoran\u201d gang, formed long before the Obama administration, and there\u2019s no evidence that its membership grew during the Obama years. The gang originated in Los Angeles\u00a0in the 1980s, according to a\u00a02005 National Gang Threat Assessment\u00a0report\u00a0funded by the Justice Department. Attorney General Jeff Sessions estimated its members number more than 10,000 \u2014 a figure the department has been using since 2006. We covered all of this in our article \u201cTrump\u2019s MS-13 Miss.\u201d", "Trump also exaggerates when he claims his administration has \u201cremoved thousands and thousands\u201d of MS-13 gang members. The administration has put a priority on the gang \u2014 but cannot provide any evidence that \u201cthousands and thousands\u201d have been removed from the country.", "Alysa Erichs, acting deputy executive associate director of Homeland Security Investigations, told a Senate subcommittee\u00a0that there have been 1,450 criminal and administrative arrests of MS-13 members from the beginning of fiscal year 2017, which started Oct. 1, 2016, through May 3, 2018. That time span includes nearly four months under President Obama and nearly 16 under Trump. A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson told us that those are the most current figures available. The spokesperson also said ICE does not track how many MS-13 members are deported.", "There are roughly 7,000\u00a0Honduran and Guatemalan emigrants traveling to Mexico and the U.S. in the hopes of seeking refugee status. The United Nations says that, as of Oct. 23, 1,500 of them\u00a0have applied for refugee status in Mexico.", "Trump portrays this \u201ccaravan\u201d as a threat to national security and accuses the Democrats of financing the caravan, repeatedly reminding his supporters that this midterm is \u201cgoing to be an election of the caravan,\u201d as he put it in Montana.", "While making a gesture of money being handed out, Trump claimed in Texas \u2014 without any evidence \u2014 that the Democrats \u201chad something to do with\u201d funding the Central American emigrants. He not only has made this claim at rallies, but also in a tweet.", "Trump, Nevada, Oct. 20: The Democrats want caravans. They like the caravans. A lot of people say, I wonder who started that caravan?", "Trump, Texas, Oct. 22:\u00a0Do you know how the caravan started? Does everybody know what this means? I think the Democrats had something to do with it.", "This unfounded conspiracy theory, as we have written,\u00a0began with an Oct. 17 tweet by Rep. Matt Gaetz, who posted a grainy video of the Central American emigrants receiving something \u2014 money? \u2014 from two men. Gaetz, who said he received the video from a \u201cHonduran government official,\u201d questioned if the money came from mega Democratic donor George Soros. But\u00a0Gaetz provided no evidence for his claim about Soros during an appearance\u00a0on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union,\u201d\u00a0saying only it would be a problem if it were happening.", "Trump implemented his \u201czero tolerance policy\u201d for families crossing the border illegally because he was frustrated with federal laws that allow some of them to seek refugee status and stay in the U.S. until their cases are heard. But the president goes too far when he claims the U.S. is required to accept all people who illegally cross the border into the U.S.", "Trump, Montana, Oct. 18:\u00a0We have the worst laws anywhere in the world. We have the dumbest laws anywhere in the world. Somebody comes in and we say, excuse me, a foot hits the ground. You know, if a foot hits the ground, we\u2019re not allowed to say, hey, go back. Every other country in the world, they say go back. Can\u2019t come in. Sorry.", "A foot hits the ground, we have to by law, with these horrible people that are making their own rulings, having nothing to do with our Constitution, we have to take those people in, even if they\u2019re, criminals and we have hardened criminals coming in. You think those people are perfect? They\u2019re not perfect.", "It\u2019s inaccurate for the president to claim the U.S. is required to \u201ctake those people in\u201d who illegally set foot in the U.S.", "\u201cIt\u2019s not true that we have to take them in, but we do have to allow them the opportunity to apply for asylum,\u201d said Sarah Pierce, a policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a misleading statement at the very least,\u201d Pierce said of Trump\u2019s claim.", "As the Congressional Research Service explains in an August 2018 report, \u201cthe Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) establishes a number of avenues by which various categories of aliens can be denied entry or removed from the United States.\u201d", "Typically, the report says, officials will place unauthorized immigrants found in the interior of the U.S. into formal removal proceedings, which involve going before an immigration judge within the Justice Department\u2019s Executive Office of Immigration Review. But officials can also use an expedited removal process \u201cwithout a hearing or further review\u201d for certain individuals stopped at or near the U.S. border who do not have \u201cvalid entry documents or [have] attempted to procure [their] admission by fraud and misrepresentation.\u201d", "However, expedited removal is not allowed, as Pierce indicated, if the person wishes to apply for asylum, a form of protection for those who can\u2019t or won\u2019t return to their home country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution. In that case, they are granted an interview with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to determine if they meet the requirements for a credible fear exemption. If they do, they are placed in formal removal proceedings where they are able to apply for asylum or related protections.", "Another CRS report from September notes that \u201cexpedited removal accounts for a substantial portion of the alien removals each year,\u201d and that Trump issued an executive order in January 2017 directing DHS to up its use of expedited removal. \u201cThe agency has yet to promulgate regulations implementing this directive,\u201d CRS says.", "The same report explains that the U.S. does not have to allow certain non-Canadian nationals arriving from Canada to apply for asylum. Instead, they are to be returned to Canada, where they can apply for protection in that country.", "Trump repeats his assertion that a proposed wall along the U.S.-Mexico border will stop the flow of illegal drugs coming from Mexico. That\u2019s not realistic, experts say, because\u00a0the vast majority of illicit drugs comes through legal ports of entry.", "Trump, Montana, Oct. 18:\u00a0You don\u2019t have the wall, you don\u2019t have a border. What you have is you have infiltration of drugs like you\u2019ve never seen.", "The fact is that Mexican cartels \u201ctransport the bulk of their drugs over the Southwest Border through ports of entry (POEs) using passenger vehicles or tractor trailers,\u201d the Drug Enforcement Administration said in a\u00a02015 report. \u201cThe drugs are typically secreted in hidden compartments when transported in passenger vehicles or comingled with legitimate goods when transported in tractor trailers.\u201d", "John Kelly, Trump\u2019s chief of staff, acknowledged at a\u00a0congressional hearing in April 2017,\u00a0when he was Department of Homeland Security secretary,\u00a0that\u00a0illegal drugs from Mexico \u201cmostly comes through the ports of entry.\u201d\u00a0At the hearing, Kelly said \u201cthe big issue really right now in drugs coming into the United States is the ports of entry.\u201d He\u00a0talked about the need to improve technology \u2013 such as\u00a0density meters\u00a0\u2013 that can \u201clook\u201d into vehicles for signs of drugs packed into tight areas.", "Experts we interviewed last year for our story \u201cWill Trump\u2019s Wall Stop Drug Smuggling?\u201d didn\u2019t think the wall would make much of a dent in the drug trade.
