Pompeo then went on to discuss the impact of the Trump administration\u2019s efforts on China (at about 50 seconds into the video).", "Pompeo, Aug. 13:\u00a0My hats off to the president, Secretary Tillerson, Ambassador Haley. They have united the world with [U.N.] sanctions against North Korea, 15-0 vote. That\u2019s real progress.", "We\u2019ve seen the Chinese now say for among the first times that they believe the correct answer has to be a denuclearized peninsula. And that\u2019s exactly the policy of the Trump administration.", "The director is right about the 15-0 U.N. Security Council vote on Aug. 5, but he gets the facts wrong about China\u2019s support for a denuclearized Korean Peninsula.", "China is a member of the six-party talks \u2013 which are \u201ca series of multilateral negotiations held intermittently since 2003 and attended by China, Japan, North Korea, Russia, South Korea, and the United States for the purpose of dismantling North Korea\u2019s nuclear program,\u201d as described by the Arms Control Association.

Acton, co-director of the Nuclear Policy Program\u00a0at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told us. \u201cThis was spelled out explicitly in, for example, the 2005 joint statement\u201d issued after the fourth round of six-party talks held in China.", "Six-party talks joint statement, Sept. 19, 2005:\u00a0The Six Parties unanimously reaffirmed that the goal of the Six-Party Talks is the verifiable denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula in a peaceful manner.", "Kelsey Davenport, director for nonproliferation policy at the Arms Control Association, said there has been no change \u201cin China\u2019s positioning on denuclearization\u201d since then.", "\u201cThere are countless examples of China condemning North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons program as illegal and reiterating that denuclearization of North Korea remains the ultimate objective,\u201d she told us in an email. \u201cChina\u2019s support for the goal of denuclearization is not new and not inspired by Trump\u2019s approach to North Korea.\u201d", "The U.N. Security Council, which includes China, has adopted seven major resolutions\u00a0in response to North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons ambitions since 2006, Davenport said.

Security Council\u2019s support for a verifiable denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.", "Resolution 1718 \u2014 the first of the seven \u2014 called for resumption of the six-party talks \u201cwith a view to the expeditious implementation of the Joint Statement issued on 19 September 2005 by China, the DPRK, Japan, the Republic of Korea, the Russian Federation and the United States, to achieve the verifiable denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\u201d", "In\u00a0Resolution 2371 \u2014\u00a0the most recent one cited by Pompeo, the U.N.
