["The claim appears in the form of a meme archived in multiple Facebook posts here, here and here.", "The posts have been shared more than\u00a02,000 times and include an image of what appear to be two rhino horns, along with the following statement: \u201cIt\u2019s believed the corona virus is possibly caused due to the use of rhino horn.\u201d", "Former international cricket star\u00a0Kevin Pietersen, an active campaigner in the fight to end rhino\u00a0poaching, added some celebrity fuel to the fire by posting the meme on his verified Twitter account on January 26, 2020\u00a0-- asking his 3,9 million followers to \u201cPLS RT?!?!?!!\u201d [Please Retweet].", "The response was mixed and covered\u00a0in this news report, with some praising Pietersen and\u00a0assuming the intention was to further rhino conservation.", "Others, however, believed the misinformation was damaging to the conservation cause, especially without evidence to back up the claim.", "James Borrell, a research fellow and conservation scientist, replied: \u201cYou seriously want to spread this rubbish? Undermines pretty much everyone working towards evidence based conservation!\u201d", "South Africa is home to the world's largest population of\u00a0rhino and for years has tried to combat rampant\u00a0poaching. The animals' horns are prized in the Far East where they are traded illegally for vast sums of money.", "The novel coronavirus emerged from the central Chinese city of Wuhan in early December 2019, as reported by\u00a0AFP here, but the exact source of the outbreak -- traced to a local \"bush meat\" market -- remains\u00a0unknown.", "The World Health Organisation (WHO) says the virus, officially known as \"2019-nCoV,\"\u00a0 is in the \"family of viruses that include the common cold, and viruses such as SARS and MERS.\"", "And the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says\u00a0public health officials were hard at work trying\u00a0to identify the source of the 2019-nCoV.", "\u201cCoronaviruses are a large family of viruses, some causing illness in people and others that circulate among animals, including camels, cats, and bats. Analysis of the genetic tree of this virus is ongoing to know the specific source of the virus.\u201d", "Researchers think the new virus probably came from bats, as the SARS virus did, with which it shares 80 percent of its genetic makeup, as reported by AFP here.", "On Monday, January 3, 2019, China's ambassador to South Africa, Lin Songtian added his voice to the debate over the origins of the virus.", "\u201cThe source of infection from this new coronavirus up to today in Wuhan, has not been discovered, including [by] America, [by] all the countries in the world, the WHO as well, up to today did not discover where the infection came from,\u201d said Songtian at a press briefing in Pretoria.", "Even with the surrounding uncertainty of where the virus came from, it could not have been rhino horn, said pathologist and head of medical virology for the University of Stellenbosch, Professor Wolfgang Preiser.", "\"Viruses need live cells, live organisms for themselves to replicate, so even the rhino horn as such, even if it\u2019s still on the rhino, would not be able to be infected with the virus because the rhino horn is dead, it's like our fingernails. A virus cannot grow in your fingernails,\u201d said Preiser in a phone call with AFP.", "He added that by the time a horn is traded in the Far East, it has been detached for weeks, months or even years, making it even less viable\u00a0as a host for\u00a0infectious viruses.", "\"There are a lot of rumours being spread, it's many fools jumping on the bandwagon and I think they are doing a lot of harm by confusing people and confusing the message,\u201d said Preiser.", "At least 425\u00a0people have died since the outbreak began, with more than 20,400\u00a0confirmed cases worldwide, as reported by AFP.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
