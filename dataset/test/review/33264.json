Is it real, or another online hoax?", "The story features screenshots from a video clip from a Ghanaian television show aired on Royal Television Ghana, also known as RTV.

The interviewer, a well-known television and radio presenter known as Otwinoko, does not identify the man.", "The original interview with the so-called Satanic leader is nearly 30 minutes long, and is part two of a series entitled \"DARKNESS IN CHURCHES.\" The interview is conducted in Akan, a language native to Ghana. It has been summarized in English by Ghanaian news site Yen.", "According to the translation, the man claimed he lived with Satan for 17 years, and would conduct routine sacrifices to sustain his power. Evil doctors gave him these sacrifices, he said, many of whom were children.

In one video, titled \"PASTOR\u2019S EVIL DEEDS EXPOSED,\" the thumbnail is a fiery 666. In another, he discusses the signs of the Antichrist. Debunking false prophets appears to be a routine feature on the show.", "As an individual, Otwinoko maintains a mystical persona. He is visually impaired, and he claims that jealous fellow journalists used voodoo to cause his blindness.", "The article by Neon Nettle claimed that \"a Satanic cult leader has confessed to carrying out more than 600 child sacrifices.\" A man did confess this on a Ghanaian television show.", "The article does acknowledge that there have been no reports of mass child killings in Ghana, Satanic or otherwise.
