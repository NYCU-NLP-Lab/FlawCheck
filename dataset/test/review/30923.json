That downward pattern is also being mirrored in many states.", "\u2022 However, some states are bucking that general pattern and seeing a rising number of new daily cases over time. This suggests a patchwork pattern where the coronavirus is accelerating in some places even as its spread is slowing overall.", "\u2022 In the states that are seeing a rising number of new daily infections, the rise is not as rapid as it was earlier in the pandemic.", "As the number of coronavirus deaths neared 100,000, President Donald Trump struck an optimistic note about the state of the pandemic.", "\"Cases, numbers and deaths are going down all over the Country!\" Trump tweeted May 24.", "Broadly, Trump has a point that the known spread of the virus has slowed in much of the United States. That said, the virus does continue to spread in some places, even if its rate of spread has declined from its level a few weeks ago.", "Let\u2019s start with the big picture.", "Coronavirus deaths shot up quickly in March, peaked in April, and have been falling, though fairly slowly, in May. (The trend line in the following charts is jagged because the daily numbers for both measures tend to be smaller on the weekends before catching up early in the week.)", "The same pattern can be found in data for the daily increases in positive coronavirus tests nationally:", "In other words, the pandemic is easing, but not disappearing. The velocity of the spread is slowing, but it hasn\u2019t stopped. The number of cases continues to grow.", "And the national picture hides substantial variation within states.", "\"The U.S. is a patchwork of local epidemics right now, and looking at an overall national trend will mask sub-national trends,\" said Joshua Michaud, associate director for global health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation. \"Some places have seen significant declines in case numbers and shrinking epidemics. Some places have not yet seen significant numbers of cases at all. Still other places see ongoing transmission and, in certain locations, epidemics that are growing, albeit slowly.\"", "Let\u2019s look at a few states where the daily number of new cases has declined steadily. Here is the data for New York and New Jersey.", "And New York and New Jersey aren\u2019t the only states that have seen clear declines. Using the Kaiser Family Foundation\u2019s data tracker, we found several other states that saw a distinct pattern of declining cases over time: Colorado, Connecticut, Kansas, Massachusetts, Michigan, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island.
