["\u201c\u2018If you\u2019ve gotten flu shots during the past ten years, you will test positive for the Wuhan strain of the Covid-19 flu\u2019 -Dr. Rashid Buttar,\u201d a Facebook post says.", "The claim can also be found on Facebook here and here, on Instagram here and on Twitter here, and has been circulating since at least April 18, 2020.", "\u201cI\u2019m happy to say this is unsubstantiated rubbish,\u201d said Dr. John Sanders, chief of infectious diseases at Wake Forest Baptist Health.", "\u201cBoth the molecular (viral detection) tests and the serologic (antibody) tests have been and are being validated and have demonstrated no cross-reactivity with antibodies generated from previous influenza vaccination,\u201d Sanders told AFP via email.", "Dr. Jacco Boon, an infectious disease professor at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, agreed that the claim is false.", "\u201cCOVID-19 is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 and this virus is unrelated to the influenza virus,\u201d he said.", "The physician cited in the posts, Dr. Rashid Buttar, has been reprimanded multiple times by the North Carolina Medical Board (NCMB) and received a warning letter from the US Food and Drug Administration for peddling unapproved, misbranded and adulterated drugs.", "Among Buttar\u2019s disputed treatments was intravenous administration of hydrogen peroxide for cancer patients, who later died.", "\u201cDr. Buttar charged exorbitant fees for his ineffectual therapies,\u201d a 2007 NCMB notice of charges and allegations reads.", "Buttar claims that flu vaccines cause false positive results for COVID-19 in multiple videos, many of which have been removed for violating YouTube\u2019s content standards.", "However, these false claims on flu vaccination are still available online, as others have recorded them.", "\u201cThe studies clearly show that if you\u2019ve had a flu shot, you\u2019re gonna test positive for COVID-19,\u201d Buttar says in audio included with this clip.", "In another clip, Buttar cites two studies as evidence for the claim. The first is a study on cats, not people, from 1984 -- 35 years before the novel coronavirus was discovered and any COVID-19 tests were carried out.", "Testing technology has improved significantly since the study was conducted, and the false positives were the result of vaccine contamination from the cell culture itself, not interaction between viruses, Sanders and Boon said.", "The second study, published in March 2012, found an \u201cincreased risk of virologically-confirmed non-influenza infections\u201d for recipients of trivalent (TIV) flu shots -- vaccines that contain three types of influenza virus.", "Sanders noted that the second study was published seven years prior to the emergence of COVID-19, and only evaluated children.", "\u201cThe majority of the noninfluenza respiratory virus detections were rhinoviruses and coxsackie/echoviruses, not coronaviruses,\u201d and the study\u2019s findings \u201chave not been repeated or expanded upon,\u201d he said.", "The current tests for COVID-19 have been validated, Sanders said, and \u201cthe receipt of TIV should not be and has not been shown to be associated with COVID-19 nor false positive testing.\u201d", "Approved 2019-2020 flu season immunizations are listed on the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website here.", "AFP Fact Check previously addressed false or misleading claims about flu shots here and here, and has debunked more than 420 examples of false and misleading information about the novel coronavirus.
