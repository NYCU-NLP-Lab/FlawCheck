["President Joe Biden has faced questions during the 2020 campaign and since his inauguration from conservative media and supporters of former President Donald Trump who claim that he is mentally unfit for office.", "Now, they are pointing to a letter that a group of Democrats in the House of Representatives sent the president this week to question whether members of Biden's own party trust him with the power over U.S. nuclear codes.", "The letter, first reported by Politico and signed by more than 30 House Democrats, urges Biden to consider alternatives to \u201cvesting one person\u201d with the authority to launch a nuclear attack. Rep. Jimmy Panetta, D-Calif., tweeted on Tuesday that he was calling on Biden \u201cto install checks & balances in our nuclear command-and-control structure. Past presidents have threatened nuclear attacks on other countries or exhibited concerning behavior that cast doubt on their judgment.\u201d", "Fox News host Sean Hannity teased a segment about the letter on his show by asking in a tweet \u201cDo the Democrats trust Biden?\u201d", "BizPacReview, which bills itself as a \u201cpolitical news website that provides breaking news and analysis unfiltered by the liberal bias that has eroded the media\u2019s credibility,\u201d connected the letter to the claims about Biden\u2019s \u201cmental status.\u201d", "BizPacReview senior managing editor Michelle Kirk said in an email that the outlet stands behind its story and that \"I am sure you will find the facts of our story 100% accurate.\"", "\"President Biden's mental state has been a prominent and open discussion\u00a0for the last few years. We have made no medical claims nor have we 'linked' the letter in this story to any specific claims,\" she said.", "Fact check:USPS investigation disproved claim of backdated ballots in Wisconsin", "Panetta and Rep. Ted Lieu, D-Calif., led the letter\u2019s 31 signatories. They wrote to raise concerns about a system that concentrates the power to launch a nuclear attack with one individual and to offer alternatives.", "And they note Biden\u2019s \u201cdistinguished record and leadership on nuclear arms control and nonproliferation as senator and vice president\u201d in asking him to dismantle that system and \u201cinstall additional checks and balances.\u201d", "\u201cYou alone possess the authority to order the use of nuclear weapons, which assures that nuclear weapons remain under civilian control,\u201d the letter said. \u201cHowever, vesting one person with this authority entails real risk. Past presidents have threatened to attack other countries with nuclear weapons or exhibited behavior that caused other officials to express concerns about the president\u2019s judgment.\u201d", "The letter cites Trump\u2019s 2018 tweet about commanding a more powerful nuclear arsenal than North Korea\u00a0and a report that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi asked the Joint Chiefs of Staff about Trump\u2019s nuclear command authority\u00a0soon after the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol building.", "It also points to a report that former Secretary of Defense James Schlesinger ordered military commanders to check first with him before launching any nuclear attack ordered by President Richard Nixon near the end of Nixon's presidency.", "\u201cWhile any president would presumably consult with advisors before ordering a nuclear attack, there is no requirement to do so,\u201d they wrote, noting that the military would be obligated to carry out a lawful order, potentially within minutes.", "They offered several alternatives, such as concurrence from others in the presidential line of succession, or requiring certification of an order\u2019s legality from both the secretary of defense and the attorney general, with concurrence from the chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff or secretary of state.", "Congressional authorization, including a declaration of war, or a \u201cpermanent active council of congressional leaders\u201d also could be used as alternatives to the president alone holding that power, they wrote.", "BizPacReview connected Democrats sending the letter to Biden\u2019s \u201cmental state,\u201d saying that it came as \u201cconcerns increase\u201d about the president\u2019s mental status. Its headline reads \"House Dems urge Biden to give up sole control of nuclear codes as mental status concerns brew.\"", "Kirk disputed that the report linked the two, though, saying that the writer segued \"into several paragraphs describing, again, how outside observers continue to show concern over the president's mental status.\"", "\"The reporter speculated that the letter could be linked to a decline in mental acuity,\" she wrote in an email to USA TODAY.", "The post on the website pointed to observations from Hannity and Grant Stinchfield, a host on the conservative outlet Newsmax TV.", "\u201cThe president\u2019s mental state was a topic of discussion in mostly conservative media circles for months ahead of the 2020 elections, while left-leaning outlets mostly avoided the subject,\u201d according to the post.", "Trump supporters claimed during the campaign that Biden was suffering from dementia, but fact checks\u00a0debunked those claims.", "Fact check:Biden didn't mangle proverb about teaching someone to fish", "The National Institute of Aging notes that a medical assessment for dementia includes medical history, physical exam and neurological tests along with brain scans and other tests. But no such information about those tests of Biden exists in the public record.", "The president also has been public about a lifelong struggle with a stutter that sometimes affects his speech patterns.", "Fact check:Joe Biden did not botch the Pledge of Allegiance in speech", "Democrats who signed the letter also made no mention of Biden\u2019s mental state and instead raised concerns about an institutional problem with giving power to launch a nuclear attack to one person, now Biden.", "Fact check:Viral video of Joe Biden on running for Senate is missing context", "The claim that dozens of House Democrats are calling on President Joe Biden to relinquish his sole control over launching a nuclear attack is MISSING CONTEXT, because without additional information it could be misleading. A group of about 30 House Democrats sent Biden a letter asking him to consider alternatives, citing concerns with past presidents, including President Donald Trump. Some posts have connected the letter to questions from Trump supporters and conservative media about Biden\u2019s mental state, but previous fact checks have debunked claims that Biden is suffering from dementia, and the letter never raises those questions.", "Thank you for supporting our journalism.
