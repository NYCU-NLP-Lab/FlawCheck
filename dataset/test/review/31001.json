["President Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally in Fayetteville, N.C., on Sept. 9, 2019. (AP/Seward)", "President Donald Trump exaggerated China\u2019s economic slowdown during a recent rally for congressional candidate Dan Bishop in Fayetteville, N.C.", "\"I want China to do well, and I hope they do well, but they\u2019ve had now the worst year in 57 years,\" he said during the Sept. 9 speech.", "It\u2019s true that China\u2019s economy is slumping, but 57 years ago, the country was still suffering from a massive famine brought on by Mao Zedong\u2019s economic policies that historians say killed as many as 45 million people. We found it impossible to believe that today\u2019s China is just as bad.", "In reality, China\u2019s economy is growing at its slowest rate in about 27 or 29 \u2014 not 57 \u2014 years.", "The Trump campaign did not say what Trump was referring to, but based on similar statements he\u2019s made in the past, it\u2019s likely that he was talking about economic growth.", "China\u2019s gross domestic product grew 6.2% in the second quarter, marking its slowest pace since the first quarter of 1992, the earliest quarterly data available on record. But that\u2019s the slowest quarterly growth in 27 years, not 57.", "The slowdown matched analysts\u2019 predictions, as the International Monetary Fund projected that China\u2019s GDP would grow 6.2% over the course of 2019. The last time China\u2019s GDP grew less than 6.2% in a year\u2019s time was in 1990 \u2014 29 years ago \u2014 when it grew just 3.9%.", "But China saw much harder times before that. For a number of years during the 1960s and \u201870s, the economy was in far worse shape than it is now, according to data from the World Bank.", "\"In the past 57 years China has had some very bad years in terms of growth and social development,\" said David Dollar, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution\u2019s China Center. \"The current situation is nowhere near as dire as any of those other periods.\"", "The Trump campaign pointed to a Wall Street Journal report suggesting China\u2019s growth could be weaker than its official data lets on.", "\"Some economists who have dissected China\u2019s GDP numbers say more accurate figures could be up to 3 percentage points lower, based on their analysis of corporate profits, tax revenue, rail freight, property sales and other measures of activity that they believe are harder for the government to fudge,\" the report said.", "But even if China\u2019s GDP growth rate was closer to 3.2%, Trump\u2019s 57-year figure would remain a stretch, since China\u2019s GDP was contracting as recently as 1976, 43 years ago.", "Oddly enough, the president accurately described China\u2019s economic slide as the \"worst in 27 years\" several times in July and August before experimenting with other timelines.", "Recently, Trump had said China\u2019s economy was at its worst point in \"30, 40 years,\" \"54 years,\" \"52 or 54 years,\" \"30 to 50 years\" and \"61 years.\"", "Reports in the Wall Street Journal have also made note of China\u2019s falling currency and diminishing industrial production. But as the New York Times noted, those economic metrics show China struggling, but not to the point of breaking 57-year records.", "In August, the Chinese yuan tumbled to its lowest value in 11 years. And in July, China\u2019s industrial output growth slowed to 4.8% from a year earlier, a 17-year low.", "Mary Lovely, professor of economics at Syracuse University and a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said China\u2019s economic slump is not particularly shocking to those who track economic growth data.", "\"As an economy develops, growth rates come down,\" she said. \"Over the long term, we have seen China\u2019s average growth rate decline, which is what we would expect.\"", "In the United States, for example, the growth rate is much lower \u2014 it was 2.8% in 2018, according to the World Bank \u2014 because growth is more dependent on technological advances than making efficient use of existing resources, Lovely said.", "Trump said China has \"had now the worst year in 57 years.\"", "China\u2019s GDP recently grew at its slowest quarterly rate in 27 years, and it is projected to grow at its slowest yearly rate in 29 years. So China\u2019s economy is slowing. But it\u2019s not at its worst point in 57 years.", "We rate this statement Mostly False.", "Aaron Rupar on Twitter, Sept. 9, 2019", "International Monetary Fund, \"People\u2019s Republic of China,\" accessed Sept. 10, 2019", "The World Bank, \"GDP growth (annual %),\" accessed Sept. 10, 2019", "History.com, \"What was the Cultural Revolution?\" Aug. 9, 2019", "The White House, \"Remarks by President Trump Before Marine One Departure,\" Aug. 30, 2019", "The White House, \"Remarks by President Trump Before Marine One Departure,\" Aug. 24, 2019", "The White House, \"Remarks by President Trump Before Marine One Departure,\" Aug. 21, 2019", "The White House, \"Remarks by President Trump and President Iohannis of Romania Before Bilateral Meeting,\" Aug. 20, 2019", "The White House, \"Remarks by President Trump Before Air Force One Departure,\" Aug. 18, 2019", "The White House, \"Remarks by President Trump Before Marine One Departure,\" Aug. 9, 2019", "The White House, \"Remarks by President Trump Before Marine One Departure,\" Aug. 1, 2019", "The White House, \"Remarks by President Trump After Marine One Arrival,\" July 31, 2019", "The White House, \"Remarks by President Trump Before Marine One Departure,\" July 30, 2019", "C-Span, \"Donald Trump White House Interview,\" July 30, 2019", "Donald J.
