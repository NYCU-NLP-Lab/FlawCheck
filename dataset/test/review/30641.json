["By Eugene Kiely", "Posted on May 22, 2019 | Updated on May 24, 2019", "President Donald Trump, in a lengthy interview on Fox News, made several statements that were false, misleading or not supported by the evidence:", "In a wide-ranging interview that aired May 19 on \u201cThe Next Revolution,\u201d Trump and the show\u2019s host, Steve Hilton, discussed foreign policy, international trade, the economy, politics and more.", "At one point, Hilton raised Trump\u2019s campaign promise to \u201cdrain the swamp,\u201d asking the president whether former White House aides should be allowed to lobby for foreign companies. The president pivoted to 2020 \u2014 implying that a potential 2020 rival, Joe Biden, intervened while he was vice president to halt an investigation in Ukraine of his son, Hunter.", "Trump twisted the facts when he said that the then-vice president threatened to withhold $2 billion in U.S. loan guarantees unless Ukraine dropped its investigation into Hunter and fired the prosecutor.\u00a0There\u2019s no evidence that Hunter was under investigation.", "Trump:\u00a0Biden, he calls them and says, \u201cDon\u2019t you dare prosecute, if you don\u2019t fire this prosecutor\u201d \u2014 the prosecutor was after his son. Then he said, \u201cIf you fire the prosecutor, you\u2019ll be OK. And if you don\u2019t fire the prosecutor, we\u2019re not giving you $2 billion in loan guarantees,\u201d or whatever he was supposed to give. Can you imagine if I did that?", "Let\u2019s review what we know \u2014 and don\u2019t know \u2014 about the Bidens and Ukraine.", "As vice president, Biden went to Ukraine and told the government that the U.S. would withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees if Ukraine failed to address corruption and remove its prosecutor general, Viktor Shokin. We know this because Biden boasted about it last year during an appearance at the Council on Foreign Relations.", "The former vice president, who is now running for president, said the incident occurred during a visit to Kiev.", "Biden, Jan. 23, 2018:\u00a0I was supposed to announce that there was another billion-dollar loan guarantee. And I had gotten a commitment from [then-Ukraine President Petro] Poroshenko and from [then-Ukraine Prime Minister Arseniy] Yatsenyuk that they would take action against the state prosecutor. And they didn\u2019t.", "So they said they had \u2014 they were walking out to a press conference. I said, nah, I\u2019m not going to \u2014 or, we\u2019re not going to give you the billion dollars. They said, you have no authority. You\u2019re not the president. The president said \u2014 I said, call him. I said, I\u2019m telling you, you\u2019re not getting the billion dollars. I said, you\u2019re not getting the billion. I\u2019m going to be leaving here in, I think it was about six hours. I looked at them and said: I\u2019m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you\u2019re not getting the money. Well, son of a bitch. He got fired.", "The U.S. wasn\u2019t the only one critical of Ukraine\u2019s anti-corruption efforts.\u00a0A month earlier, the International Monetary Fund threatened to withhold $40 billion unless Ukraine undertook \u201ca substantial new effort\u201d to fight corruption.", "At the time, Hunter Biden was a board member for the\u00a0Burisma Group, one of the biggest private gas companies in Ukraine. He joined the board in May 2014, instantly raising concerns about a potential conflict of interest. An Associated Press article called Biden\u2019s hiring \u201cpolitically awkward.\u201d", "\u201cHunter Biden\u2019s employment means he will be working as a director and top lawyer for a Ukrainian energy company during the period when his father and others in the Obama administration attempt to influence the policies of Ukraine\u2019s new government, especially on energy issues,\u201d the\u00a0AP wrote.", "However, there is no evidence that Hunter Biden was under investigation or that his father pressured Ukraine on his behalf.", "A few days before Fox News aired the Trump interview, Yuriy Lutsenko, Ukraine\u2019s current prosecutor general, gave his own interview to Bloomberg News and said:\u00a0\u201cHunter Biden did not violate any Ukrainian laws at least as of now, we do not see any wrongdoing.\u201d", "Lutsenko told Bloomberg that the\u00a0prosecutor general\u2019s office in 2014 \u2014 before Shokin took office \u2014 opened a corruption investigation against Mykola Zlochevsky, the owner of Burisma, and numerous others. He said the probe\u2019s focus was\u00a0Serghi Kurchenko, who owned a number of gas companies, and a transaction that occurred in November 2013, months before Biden joined Burisma.", "Bloomberg News, May 16:\u00a0As part of the 5-year-old inquiry, the prosecutor general\u2019s office has been looking at whether Kurchenko\u2019s purchase of an oil storage terminal in southern Ukraine from Zlochevksy in November 2013 helped Kurchenko launder money. Lutsenko said the transaction under scrutiny came months before Hunter Biden joined the Burisma board.", "\u201cBiden was definitely not involved,\u201d Lutsenko said. \u201cWe do not have any grounds to think that there was any wrongdoing starting from 2014.\u201d", "The investigation is still active, he said.", "The president also spoke about North Korea and its nuclear weapons program. Trump met with North Korea dictator\u00a0Kim Jong Un in June of last year, and the two leaders agreed to \u201cpromote the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\u201d", "During Kim\u2019s reign, North Korea has conducted numerous nuclear tests and missile launches \u2014 including four nuclear weapons tests and three test launches of intercontinental ballistic missiles, or ICBMs.", "Trump:\u00a0But, they haven\u2019t had any tests over the last two years \u2014 zero. There\u2019s a chart and it shows 24 tests, 22 tests, 18 tests. Then I come, and once I\u2019m there for a little while you know, we went through a pretty rough rhetorical period. Once I\u2019m there for a little while, no tests, no tests, no tests.", "It\u2019s true that North Korea has not conducted a nuclear test since Sept. 3, 2017, and it hasn\u2019t launched an ICBM since Nov. 29, 2017. (See details in the Arms Control Association timeline.) But North Korea has\u00a0conducted short-range missile tests twice this month, and it continues to actively pursue a nuclear weapons program.", "The U.S. intelligence community released a\u00a0threat assessment report\u00a0in January that said, \u201cWe continue to observe activity inconsistent with full denuclearization.\u201d", "The report didn\u2019t detail what kind of activity. But a week earlier, the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington issued a report that said it found \u201capproximately 20 undeclared missile operating bases,\u201d including one that serves as a missile headquarters.", "A month later, three Stanford University researchers issued a report that said North Korea \u201ccontinued to operate and, in some cases, expand the nuclear weapons complex infrastructure. It continued to operate its nuclear facilities to produce plutonium and highly enriched uranium that may allow it to increase the number of nuclear weapons in its arsenal from roughly 30 in 2017 to 35-37.\u201d", "Another subject that the president addressed was the ongoing trade war with China.", "The\u00a0Trump administration last year\u00a0imposed tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods, and China responded with tariffs on $110 billion of U.S. goods. The trade dispute escalated this month. First, the Trump administration on May 10\u00a0raised\u00a0tariffs from 10 percent to 25 percent on about $200 billion worth of Chinese goods. China\u00a0responded\u00a0three days later when it announced\u00a0that it would increase tariffs from 10 percent to 25 percent on roughly $60 billion worth of U.S. goods, beginning June 1.", "The dispute has hurt U.S. agricultural exports in particular, and the administration responded by authorizing up to $12 billion in aid to U.S. farmers. Trump said he would increase financial assistance to $15 billion and explained how he arrived at that number.", "Trump:\u00a0I said to Sonny Perdue, Department of Agriculture \u2014 secretary of Agriculture \u2013 \u201cSonny, what\u2019s the most money that China has ever paid toward agriculture, toward buying food product?\u201d He said $15 billion a number of years ago. I said \u201cIs that the most?\u201d He said \u201cYes.\u201d Some people will say close to (inaudible) but $15 billion was about the most. I said \u201cGood. I\u2019m going to take $15 billion out of the $100 billion, and I\u2019m going to give that to our farmers.\u201d", "Trump told a similar story\u00a0in a recent speech to the National Association of Realtors.", "Trump, May 17:\u00a0So I called Sonny Perdue, our great Secretary of Agriculture, and I said, \u201cSonny\u2026\u201d \u2014 (applause) \u2014 I said, \u201cSonny, what\u2019s the biggest amount they\u2019ve ever spent in this country?\u201d He said, \u201cAbout $15 billion. People could say 18, 19. But basically $15 billion.\u201d And I said, \u201cSo let\u2019s take $15 billion, set it aside out of the 100 or 125 billion [in annual tariffs imposed on all imports].\u201d", "We asked the White House and the Department of Agriculture about this conversation. Neither responded. The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative referred us to the White House.", "But this much we know based on available data and emails from two federal agencies:\u00a0$15 billion isn\u2019t \u201cthe biggest amount\u201d that China has spent on U.S. agricultural exports.", "In its annual reports on shifts in U.S. merchandise trade, the\u00a0United States International Trade Commission\u00a0reported\u00a0that China purchased $27.2 billion in U.S. agricultural products in 2012 \u2013 the most in one year from 2010 to 2017.", "The most recent USITC report covers 2013 to 2017, and a commission spokeswoman told us a new report covering 2018 would not be released until November. However, according to the Department of Agriculture, agricultural exports to China fell dramatically to\u00a0$9.2 billion\u00a0in 2018.\u00a0That was\u00a0\u201calmost all due to retaliatory tariffs\u201d imposed by China,\u00a0Wallace E. Tyner, who teaches agricultural economics at Purdue University, told us in an email.", "We also know that, as of the morning of May 20, the U.S. has paid $8.54 billion to farmers through three aid programs, a USDA spokesperson said.", "The Market Facilitation Program\u00a0\u2014 the largest of the three programs \u2014 can provide up to $10 billion to producers of corn, cotton, sorghum, soybean, wheat, dairy, hogs, almonds and sweet cherries, according to a December\u00a0report\u00a0by the Congressional Research Service on the trade aid programs. The top five commodities that received assistance through the program were soybeans, corn, wheat, cotton and sorghum, the USDA spokesperson told us.", "We found that, from 2009 through 2018, the most that China imported of those five commodities in any one year totaled nearly $20 billion, according to Census Bureau export data. That occurred in 2012, when China\u2019s agricultural purchases included nearly $14.9 billion in soybeans, $3.4 billion in raw cotton and $1.3 billion in corn, according to Census data.", "As we said, we don\u2019t know what the president meant when he said that $15 billion was \u201cthe biggest amount they\u2019ve ever spent in this country.\u201d We will update this item if the White House responds.", "In talking about the U.S. economy, Trump boasted about companies coming to the United States \u2014 singling out one car company in particular.", "Trump: Well, really very simply, we have companies coming in here, as you know, by the dozens and by the hundreds and big ones, car companies, Honda\u2019s coming in with $14.5 billion.", "We don\u2019t know how many companies have relocated to the U.S. or have left the U.S. But the president overestimates Honda\u2019s future investment in the U.S.", "On its website, Honda said that its total capital investment in the U.S. (not just auto manufacturing) has been $21 billion over the last 60 years, including $5.6 billion in the last five years. We could not find any new automotive investments that would equal $14.5 billion, so we reached out to the Michigan-based Center for Automotive Research Group, which tracks new investments in the United States.", "Kristin Dziczek, vice president of industry, labor and economics, told us that she, too, could not match the $14.5 billion figure cited by Trump, and \u201cwe try to keep very close tabs on these things.\u201d She said Honda has announced auto manufacturing investments totaling $1.7 billion over the last five years.", "In February, Honda announced that it would close a manufacturing plant in Swindon, England, in 2121, when it stops production of its current Civic model. Honda Chief Executive Officer Takahiro Hachigo told Automotive News that the next generation Civic will be manufactured in North America, but the company has yet to say where the plant or plants will be located.", "Update, May 24: \u201cWe have not provided any further detail other than we are considering production of Civic for North America in North America,\u201d Honda corporate spokesman Chris Abbruzzese told us in an email. He provided us with a list of $712 million worth of vehicle manufacturing investments that Honda had made in the United States in 2017 and 2018.", "\u201cWe do not disclose our future investment plans publicly,\u201d Abbruzzese said.", "Honda currently has five\u00a0vehicle manufacturing plants in the United States, including one in Indiana that builds the current Civic models. It also manufactures Civic models in Ontario, Canada.", "The president also boasted that he has \u201ctremendous poll numbers now.\u201d", "It\u2019s subjective, of course, to describe one\u2019s poll numbers as \u201ctremendous.\u201d\u00a0But Trump\u2019s average job approval rating \u2014 based on polling data assembled from dozens of polls by Real Clear Politics and FiveThirtyEight\u00a0\u2014 is currently below 43 percent.", "As of May 22, Trump\u2019s average job approval rating on Real Clear Politics was 42.5 percent, and FiveThirtyEight put it at 41.1 percent. By contrast, those who disapproved of Trump\u2019s job performance averaged 53.7 percent, according to Real Clear Politics, and 53.8 percent, according to FiveThirtyEight.", "As for individual polls taken this month, Trump\u2019s job approval rating reached a peak of 51 percent in the Zogby Poll, which was conducted May 2 to May 9 and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.4 percent. The low point was a Morning Consult poll, which showed the president at 37 percent. That poll was taken May 17 to 19, and had an error margin of plus or minus 2 percent.", "As we often find, the president also repeated some false claims that we have previously debunked:", "China Trade Deficit: The president said, \u201cWe have a trade deficit with China of $500 billion.\u201d That\u2019s false. As we have written before, the U.S.\u00a0trade deficit with China\u00a0in goods and services was\u00a0a record $378.7 billion\u00a0in 2018,\u00a0according to\u00a0the Bureau of Economic Analysis (see table 3). The U.S. had a $419.3 billion deficit with China in goods (table 6) and a $40.5 billion surplus in services (table 9).", "Tariff Revenue: Trump said that, as a result of tariffs he has placed on Chinese goods, \u201cwe are going to be taking in possibly $100 billion, possibly more than that in tariffs. We never took in 10 cents from China.\u201d It\u2019s not true, as we have previously said, that the U.S. has never collected tariffs on Chinese goods. The amount of tariff revenue has increased, but the U.S. did collect billions of dollars each year since at least 2000. For example, the U.S. collected about $13.4 billion in 2016, according to\u00a0the\u00a0U.S. International Trade Commission database. As we also wrote, tariffs are taxes paid by U.S. importers in the form of customs duties, not by the Chinese government or its companies.", "Liquefied Natural Gas Exporting. The president said,\u00a0\u201cI was in Louisiana opening up a $10 billion LNG plant that would\u2019ve never been approved under another type of administration, never,\u201d and, \u201cThey\u2019ve been trying for years to get it built, but we got approvals very quickly for the big LNG.\u201d\u00a0That\u2019s false. As we wrote before, the plant in question, Sempra Energy\u2019s Cameron LNG plant, was approved in 2014 by the Obama administration, a fact Sempra Energy confirmed.", "Update, Sept. 27: An earlier version of this story said that Biden\u2019s threat to withhold a $1 billion loan guarantee to Ukraine occurred in March 2016. We could not verify the exact date when Biden issued his ultimatum.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
