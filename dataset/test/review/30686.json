["About this rating", "A video purportedly showing a 50-foot-long giant squid that washed up on a beach has been around for years, but made a big splash once again on social media in November 2016:", "According to the accompanying description, the squid washed up on a beach in Punakaiki, New Zealand on 1 March 2015.

Here's a comparison of the two images:", "This is not the first time that a photograph of a beached whale has been used as a digital media backdrop for giant squid hoaxes. In January 2014, an image of whale was doctored and shared with a similar claim.
