["About this rating", "Radio personality Hal Turner ran a segment on Aug. 8, 2019, that purported to report on an admission from NASA that climate change does not occur from human-made factors. This journalistic \u201cscoop\u201d did not come from a whistleblower or leaked documents, Turner stated, but from a 20-year-old educational feature on NASA\u2019s publicly accessible online magazine, Earth Observatory:", "On its Earth Observatory web site, NASA published in the year 2000, the information they possessed about the Milankovitch Climate Theory, which was PROVED to be fact by core samples from the earth's seas.\u00a0 Climate Changes - warming and destructive weather - happen naturally from changes in earth's solar orbit, and the extent of earth's axis tilt.\u00a0 NOT from man-induced factors!", "This story was picked up by the website Natural News, where it gained further virality. One of the more telling approaches for outlets that promote a specific brand of climate-change denial is to report as news their \u201cdiscovery\u201d of something that, while perhaps new to them, is fundamental to the field of climate science and in no way in conflict with the concept of anthropogenic climate change.", "When climate scientists discuss evidence for anthropogenic changes in the climate system, they do not simultaneously argue that there are no natural causes of variation in the climate system. Asserting that would be a straw-man argument. Evidence of natural climate variability is not evidence of a lack of human input into the climate system. That is, however, the sole premise both the Natural News and Hal Turner posts work with, per Natural News:", "It was the year 1958, to be precise, when NASA first observed that changes in the solar orbit of the earth, along with alterations to the earth\u2019s axial tilt, are both responsible for what climate scientists today have dubbed as \u201cwarming\u201d (or \u201ccooling,\u201d depending on their agenda). In no way, shape, or form are humans warming or cooling the planet by driving SUVs or eating beef, in other words.", "(As an aside, 1958 was the year NASA was founded. It holds zero specific relevance to the history of Milankovitch cycles.)", "As accurately copied and pasted from NASA\u2019s website, Milankovich cycles do indeed describe three periodic variations in the way the Earth rotates around the sun. Eccentricity describes the shape (how circular or oblong the path is) of Earth\u2019s orbit around the sun. That shape varies over long periods of time between nearly a perfect circle and slightly oval-shaped orbit. The eccentricity cycle, from circular to oval and back to circular, lasts (in simplified terms) roughly 100,000 years.", "Another cycle, precession, describes how the orientation of Earth\u2019s axis varies over time such that the North Pole is not always pointed at the North Star as it is today. Instead, it cycles like a slightly off-center toy top, returning to its original position every 26,000 years. The final cycle, axial tilt or obliquity, describes the angle at which Earth's axis is tilted. This angle, which is responsible for our seasons, is not fixed and ranges between 22.1 and 24.5 degrees over a cycle that lasts 41,000 years.", "Knowledge of these cycles, each of which affects aspects of the climate system in different ways, is immensely helpful to scientists \u2014 especially climate scientists. Combining the relative input of each of these cycles, scientists can mathematically determine how much solar energy any given part of the Earth\u2019s surface would have received at any time going back (or forward) in time. In geologic records of past climate, the rhythm of this cycle can be seen in intricate detail such that it can be used to figure out how much time a given rock or core sample represents. This holds up even if that rock was deposited alongside dinosaurs millions of years in the past.", "Milankovitch cycles do not complicate the scientific observation that human-released CO2 is causing an observable net increase in global temperatures. Milankovitch cycles operate on time scales that are vastly greater \u2014 tens to hundreds of thousands of years \u2014 than the timescales at issue for anthropogenic global warming.", "Left to its own devices, the orbital arrangement our planet currently finds itself in would likely keep us in the current interglacial period (not a widespread ice age, not an ice-free world) we currently find ourselves in for another 50,000 years \u2014 a relatively quiet period of time from a Milankovich perspective. In other words, Milankovitch cycles cannot address rapid rises in temperatures that are currently being witnessed on human time scales \u2014 events occurring on time periods that represent a fraction of even the shortest Milankovitch cycle. The concern is what added effect humans are putting into the system on top of the more slowly varying orbital changes.", "The assertion that NASA is \u201cadmitting\u201d anything by acknowledging the not-at-all controversial existence of Milankovitch cycles is false, and a full article alleging as such betrays nothing but an ignorance of the field such outlets claim to be exposing.", "Hal Turner Radio Show. \u00a0 \u201cNASA: \u2018Climate Change\u2019 and Global Warming Caused by Changes in Earth's Solar Orbit and Axial Tilt - Not Man-Made Causes.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 8 August 2019.", "Graham, Steve. \u00a0 \u201cMilutin Milankovitch.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Earth Observatory. \u00a0 24 March 2000.", "Huff, Ethan. \u00a0 \u201cNASA Admits That Climate Change Occurs Because of Changes in Earth\u2019s Solar Orbit, and Not Because of Suvs and Fossil Fuels.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Natural News. \u00a0 30 August 2019.", "Konecky, Bronwen L., et al. \u00a0 \u201cAtmospheric Circulation Patterns During Late Pleistocene Climate Changes at Lake Malawi, Africa.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Earth and Planetary Science Letters. \u00a0 20 November 2011.", "Meyers, Stephen R. \u00a0 \u201cSeeing Red in Cyclic Stratigraphy: Spectral Noise Estimation for Astrochronology.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Paleoceanography. \u00a011 September 2012.", "Olsen, Paul E. \u00a0 \u201cA 40-Million-Year Lake Record of Early Mesozoic Orbital Climatic Forcing.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Science. \u00a0 14 November 1986.", "Harrington, Samatha. \u00a0 \u201cWhat Causes Climate Change?
