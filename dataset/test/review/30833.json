["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "Acting Newark Police Director Samuel DeMaio has set many precedents during his tenure with the Newark Police Department.\n\nBut there is one distinction he doesn\u2019t want: \"to be the first cop in the state of New Jersey\" to release his internal affairs record.\n\nDuring a recent interview on FOX 5\u2019s \"Good Day New York\" program, a reporter said to DeMaio, \"The city council president, Donald Payne Jr., has really been pressing. He wants to see your internal affairs record. He believes there have been infractions in the past, committed by you. He wants to see your record. Why not release it to him?\"\n\n\"It's really that I can't,\" DeMaio replied. \"There are Attorney General guidelines in place that protect it because of what's in those records. It's any allegation ... what I can say is there\u2019s no sustained complaints on my record. I don't want to be the first cop in the state of New Jersey to set that precedent. It\u2019s just not an issue.\"\n\nPolitiFact New Jersey learned there are guidelines covering different files kept on police officers, and there are strict protections on internal affairs files to maintain their confidentiality. But there are exceptions -- one of which would allow the release of DeMaio\u2019s internal affairs file.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s explain why DeMaio is being asked to release his records.\n\nDeMaio was appointed acting top cop in Newark days before the U.S. Justice Department announced an investigation into the Newark Police Department.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey last year petitioned the federal government to investigate alleged civil-rights abuses by the department. When the previous police director, Garry McCarthy, announced his departure, ACLU-NJ Executive Director Deborah Jacobs asked Newark Mayor Cory Booker to require any internal candidate for the position \u00a0to \"voluntarily disclose to the public their work assignment history and their internal affairs/disciplinary history.\"\n\nAfter DeMaio\u2019s appointment was announced, Jacobs wrote in a May 10 opinion-editorial piece, \"For DeMaio, the need for transparency is especially pressing,\" citing a 2007 incident when DeMaio was reprimanded by the state Attorney General\u2019s Office for questioning a witness about his immigration status, as well as other concerns about DeMaio\u2019s reputation in the community.\n\nIn Jacobs\u2019 op-ed, she referred to the files she wants released as both internal affairs records and disciplinary records.\n\nCity council members and a group of Newark pastors have also called for DeMaio to release his file, which they often refer to as his disciplinary record.\n\nBut a disciplinary record is generally not maintained as a separate file. The state Attorney General\u2019s Office recommends police departments keep a personnel file, an internal affairs file and a medical file on police officers.\n\nA Booker spokeswoman told us the Newark Police Department follows that system.\n\nDeMaio correctly stated that state Attorney General guidelines protect internal affairs files. The guidelines state that \"the nature and source of internal allegations, the progress of internal affairs investigations, and the resulting materials are confidential information.\"\n\nThe guidelines describe several \"limited circumstances\" under which records from internal affairs investigations can be released, including upon a court order and upon the request of the county prosecutor or Attorney General.\n\nBut the guidelines also state, \"the law enforcement executive officer may authorize access [to] a particular file or record for good cause.\"\n\nThe state Attorney General\u2019s Office refused to confirm that the guidelines authorize Newark\u2019s police director to release an internal affairs file.\n\nBooker\u2019s spokeswoman said the police director is the \"law enforcement executive officer\" in the city. She also noted, \"it should be pointed out that when they say a \u2018particular file\u2019 they mean incident specific.\"\n\nJames Drylie, executive director of Kean University\u2019s school of criminal justice, said that while DeMaio has the authority to release his internal affairs file as the \"law enforcement executive officer,\" the state Attorney General guidelines clearly aim to keep those files confidential.\n\nThe city administration sent this statement when we requested comment from DeMaio: \"Acting Police Director DeMaio remains focused on his number one priority - the public safety of our residents and making sure that this summer will be Newark\u2019s safest.\"\n\nLet\u2019s review. DeMaio said he can\u2019t release his internal affairs record because there are state Attorney General guidelines protecting it.\n\nThe state Attorney General\u2019s guidelines describe an internal affairs file as a confidential document, but also lays out specific exceptions to that policy -- one of which technically allows DeMaio to release his file.\n\nWe rate DeMaio\u2019s statement False.", "To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.", "Fox 5 Good Day New York,Interview with Newark Police Director Samuel DeMaio and Newark Mayor Cory Booker, June 9, 2011\n\nInterview with Peter Aseltine, spokesman for New Jersey Attorney General\u2019s office, June 13 &14, 2011\n\nInterview with Raymond Hayducka, second vice president of the New Jersey State Association of Chiefs of Police and South Brunswick police chief, June 13, 2011\n\nNew Jersey Attorney General, Internal Affairs Policy & Procedures, accessed June 13, 2011\n\nThe Star-Ledger, \"Acting Newark police director Samuel DeMaio vows changes, shrugs off controversy,\" May 18, 2011\n\nThe Star-Ledger, \"Deputy Chief Samuel DeMaio is named Newark's acting police director,\" May 3, 2011\n\nThe Star-Ledger, Newark pastors, council members ask new police director to release disciplinary record, May 6, 2011\n\nU.S. Department of Justice, \"Justice Department Opens Investigation into the Newark, N.J., Police Department,\" May 9, 2011\n\nDeborah Jacobs, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey, \"Release Newark Police Director's Disciplinary Records,\" \u00a0May 10, 2011\n\nEmail interview with Anne Torres, spokeswoman for Newark Mayor Cory Booker, June 17, 2011 and June 22, 2011\n\nInterview with Alexander Shalom, policy counsel for ACLU-NJ, June 17, 2011\n\nEmail interview with Rachel Goemaat, spokeswoman for the state Attorney General\u2019s Office, June 17, 2011 and June 20, 2011\n\nOpen Public Records Act,\" C.47:1A-10 Personnel, pension records not considered public document; exceptions,\" accessed June 17, 2011\n\nInterview with James Drylie, executive director of Kean University\u2019s School of Criminal Justice, June 21, 2011", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
