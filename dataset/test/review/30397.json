["About this rating", "In May 2016,\u00a0photographs and messages reproduced above began circulating on Facebook\u00a0along with claims that\u00a0lurking underneath labels of\u00a0pricey salon-brand hair products purchased through discount retailers were cheaper, lower quality brands.", "Photographs\u00a0show\u00a0the\u00a0CHI line of hair care products with T.J. Maxx price tag and the label half peeled away to show\u00a0a\u00a0bottle bearing a less expensive (and presumably lower-quality) hair care product. Most versions\u00a0of the claim included an assertion that salon-brand hair products should only be bought at hair salons, not discount retailers.", "The rumors served as a tacit criticism of\u00a0salon clientele who purchase product\u00a0from third parties rather than\u00a0from salons or stylists (who would earn commission and meet salon sales goals otherwise). A similar social media rumor\u00a0maintained that\u00a0eyelash extensions\u00a0can cause \"lash lice,\" a story spread\u00a0primarily by multi-level marketing salespeople hawking\u00a0mascara.", "In another instance, salons and stylists spread a rumor that Pantene (one of the top-selling drugstore hair care brands) can be\u00a0flammable in combination with popular hair-lightening treatments. Both rumors began with or were passed along\u00a0by people\u00a0invested in the sale of competing products at full price.", "T.J. Maxx said\u00a0that the CHI products depicted were genuine:", "At T.J. Maxx, conducting our business with integrity means everything to us and we take pride in offering our customers great values on high quality brand-name products. We have looked into your concerns and can assure you that the contents of the bottle are authentic and are as described on the outer label. We have also confirmed with our supplier that its relabeling of the bottle was appropriate. We thank you for your ongoing patronage of our stores.", "CHI also responded our questions\u00a0about the photographs.\u00a0The company explained that the labeling was due in part\u00a0to manufacturing fluctuations, as well as cutting back on unnecessary waste:", "Recently, several of our customers have noticed cans of CHI\u00ae products with labels covering up other products. We sincerely wish to clear up any confusion. The Egyptian Oil and French Oil and other cans you may have seen were originally another CHI\u00ae product brand we manufactured. Due to a legal challenge that arose concerning the new brand names and designs, we were forced to cease production. As a result of this, we were left with many empty cylinders. To avoid them taking up vital space in our warehouse but most importantly, adding unnecessary waste to landfills, we decided to uphold our environmentally conscious efforts that we have maintained since 1986. We felt we made the right decision by placing original CHI\u00ae labels over these cylinders and filling them with our CHI\u00ae formulas. Therefore, the product is authentically made by Farouk Systems with the correct CHI\u00ae label on them and product inside. We sincerely apologize for any confusion this may have caused our customers.", "One of the two viral photographs didn't display a T.J. Maxx or Marshall's price tag, strongly suggesting\u00a0that the relabeled\u00a0bottles were indeed not\u00a0restricted to non-salon retail environments. CHI's statement affirmed\u00a0the relabeled bottles\u00a0were in no way different than any other from the brand, whether purchased in a salon or a discount department store.\u00a0In this instance, both the retailer and the manufacturer said that\u00a0the product packaging was simply repurposed, but the contents remain authentic and identical to products sold in salons and other non-discount retail environments. (In instances where counterfeiting occurs, the company\u00a0being impersonated\u00a0is typically the first to object to dilution of their brand.)", "However, it is likely the rumor will\u00a0persist\u00a0among stylists and salons seeking to warn clients off low-priced alternatives.", "Kim LaCapria is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
