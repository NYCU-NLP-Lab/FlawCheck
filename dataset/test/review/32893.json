Yes, according to an infectious diseases expert who presented a webinar to members of the American Hospitals Association.", "But a story being shared on social media ominously refers to \"leaked documents\" and carries an alarmist headline that makes it sound as though hospitals are secretly preparing for an outbreak of that size:", "\"U.S. hospitals are preparing for 96 million coronavirus infections and nearly half a million deaths, leaked documents reveal,\" reads a March 7, 2020, headline on an article from the Daily Mail, a British newspaper.", "The post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

When\u00a0we contacted the Daily Mail for this fact-check, a spokesman said the headline would be changed.

A separate March 7, 2020, story about Lawler\u2019s estimates in another United Kingdom-based newspaper, The Independent, said Lawler \"advised hospitals to prepare\" for an outbreak of this size. That\u2019s a different tone than is implied by the Daily Mail headline.", "\"I HOPE hospitals are preparing for this,\" Lawler told PolitiFact by email. \"Word is percolating through groundswell of professional networks as people hear ground truth from Italy, but I am afraid official sources for information are way behind.\"", "The original post said, \"U.S. hospitals are preparing for 96 million coronavirus infections and nearly half a million deaths, leaked documents reveal.\"", "One expert estimated at an American Hospital Association webinar that there could be 96 million coronavirus cases and 480,000 deaths in the United States.", "But these supposedly \"leaked\" documents were slides presented by one epidemiologist during a webinar to members of the American Hospital Association.
