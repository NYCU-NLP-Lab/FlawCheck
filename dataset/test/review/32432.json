["About this rating", "Interest in a statement\u00a0purportedly uttered\u00a0by 19th century African-American abolitionist Harriet Tubman was renewed in April 2016 after the U.S. Treasury Department\u00a0announced that a portrait of the famous American humanitarian would be replacing that of President Andrew Jackson on the front of the U.S. $20 bill:", "In\u00a02008, feminist writer Robin Morgan penned an\u00a0essay\u00a0intended as a\u00a0sequel to her famous 1970 \"Goodbye to All That\" piece. One passage\u00a0focused on \"post-feminism\" and used a quote purportedly from\u00a0Harriet Tubman to suggest\u00a0that some women don't realize the fight for equality isn't over:", "Goodbye to women of any age again feeling unworthy, sulking \u201cwhat if she\u2019s not electable?\u201d or \u201cmaybe it\u2019s post-feminism and whoooosh we\u2019re already free.\u201d Let a statement by the magnificent Harriet Tubman stand as reply. When asked how she managed to save hundreds of enslaved African Americans via the Underground Railroad during the Civil War, she replied bitterly, \u201cI could have saved thousands \u2014 if only I\u2019d been able to convince them they were slaves.\u201d", "While Morgan presented this phrase as an authentic quote from Harriet Tubman, several historical scholars disagreed. The Maxwell Perspective attempted to get to the bottom of the issue in an article published shortly after Morgan's essay:", "Within days, the validity of the quote was called into question by Ralph Luker of the History News Network, who contacted scholars who have researched Tubman\u2014including Milton Sernett, professor emeritus of history at the Maxwell School (and African American studies at SU). Sernett is the author of the recently published Harriet Tubman: Myth, Memory, and History.", "None could trace the quote to primary sources.", "\u201cMy impression is that this is a late 20th-century quote from a fictionalized account of Tubman\u2019s life,\u201d Sernett told Luker. \u201cWhoever wishes to use the dubious quote as a political zinger ought to cite a reliable source.\u201d", "Likewise, Kate Clifford Larson (author of\u00a0Bound for the Promised Land: Harriet Tubman, Portrait of an American Hero)\u00a0vowed that the quotation was of recent vintage, and no evidence backed the notion that the abolitionist actually spoke or wrote these words:", "There is no original quote for this. This quote was entirely made up, and became popularized starting sometime in the the 1990s. There is no documentation, nor historical basis for this quote.", "Rice University professor (and slavery historian) Dr. W. Caleb McDaniel wrote that circulating this particular\u00a0fake quote is actually harmful both to Tubman's legacy and to current\u00a0efforts of anti-slavery activism:", "Modern historians know the truth: enslaved people resisted their condition in countless ways, large and small. If they were not able to attain freedom, it was not because they didn\u2019t want it or because (as the fake Tubman quote would have it) they \u201cdid not know they were slaves.\u201d It was because powerful forces were arrayed against them. The idea of \u201ctacit consent\u201d distracted attention from that fact.", "I worry that the fake Tubman quote could have the same \u201cred herring\u201d effect in conversations about modern trafficking. It encourages activists who quote and read it to believe that the only thing standing between modern slaves and freedom is knowledge, self-awareness, education, and a willingness to actively dissent. But the corollary comes uncomfortably close to the paternalistic idea that those who somehow \u201cchoose\u201d not to be freed or don\u2019t \u201cknow\u201d they are slaves must tacitly consent to their own exploitation.", "It is pleasant to think that the only obstacle abolitionists face is \u201cfalse consciousness\u201d on the part of trafficked persons.
