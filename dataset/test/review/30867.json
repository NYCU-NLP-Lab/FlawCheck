The heavens poured down rain like waterfall and the earth opened its mouth to absorb the water at the same time. This happened only yesterday,\u201d reads the caption on the video, which was posted on May 24, 2016.", "The video has also been widely shared among francophone Facebook users, including on this Senegalese group with more than 70,000 followers.", "Some commenters suggested that the video showed a geyser -- a vent in the earth\u2019s surface that ejects hot water and steam.", "Others interpreted it as a miracle.", "Miracle or not, watching the video with the sound on provides the first indication that has been wrongly captioned -- the voices heard in the background are speaking Vietnamese, which is strange considering this event supposedly took place in Togo, West Africa.", "\u201cLook, it\u2019s so amazing!\u201d a man can be heard saying.", "\u201cThe ground around the water column is nearly breaking,\u201d a woman says. \u201cIt\u2019s so high!\u201d", "But where was the video actually filmed?", "A reverse image search using the online tool Yandex quickly led to numerous Vietnamese-language videos showing the same event. Notably, there was this TV report from June 2, 2015, uploaded to YouTube by the Vietnamese channel VTC 14.", "The Vietnamese report says it shows a jet of foul-smelling water that burst up to 20 metres (66 feet) into the sky during an operation to drill a new well in the southern province of Ba Ria-Vung Tau. According to the landowner, \u201cup until his interview, the water had been spraying for 18 hours and he didn\u2019t expect the water to spray that high,\u201d said Quy Bui, a reporter in AFP\u2019s bureau in Hanoi, Vietnam. Officials cited in the report said \u201cthe incident occurred apparently because the family drilled too deep onto the ground,\u201d Quy added.", "Vietnam\u2019s water authority wrote on its website that the owner of the well had breached regulations by drilling too deep.", "A closer view of the incident can be seen in another video that was posted on YouTube, on June 1, 2015. From this angle, ten seconds in you can see that the water is bursting from the ground, not the sky.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023. All rights reserved.
