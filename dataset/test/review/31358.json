["About this rating", "The claim that Iowans are legally prohibited from kissing for more than five minutes has been circulating on the internet for more than a decade. While this \"dumb law\" has been reported by dozens of web sites, it appears to have originated on a joke web site and not\u00a0with any actual legislation.", "This is frequently shared on social media and has appeared on web sites such as\u00a0Only In Your State, news outlets such as\u00a0My San Antonio, and\u00a0books such as\u00a0The Duh Awards: In This Stupid World, We Take the Prize.\u00a0While this \"dumb law\" has been shared far and wide on the internet, the majority of these outlets fail to provide any evidence that this law actually exists; when a web site does provide a source link, it is typically directed at the web site\u00a0Dumblaws.com:", "Kisses may last for no more than five minutes.", "While\u00a0Dumblaws.com\u00a0does provide the \"full text of the law\" for many of its items, several laws (including Iowa's alleged kissing law) are presented without\u00a0proof.

While \"James Fuqua's Law Jokes\" does offer a few citations, the listing for Iowa's kissing law is \u2014 once again\u00a0\u2014 presented without evidence.", "Our search of the Iowa Legislature also came up empty handed. While we found dozens of laws related to kissing, largely connected to sexual assault or child abuse, we found no record of Iowa legally limiting the length of a kiss. \u00a0At any rate, it seems that it would be a difficult law to\u00a0enforce.", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
