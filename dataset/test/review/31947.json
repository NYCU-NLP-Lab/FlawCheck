I am struck by the fact the president hasn't really led in this regard. He's not paying women equally by his own measures in his own White House.\"", "\"In the\u00a0White House, women do earn equal pay for equal work,\" Jarrett said.\u00a0\"The bill that\u2019s currently before Congress would make it easier for women to find out if they are being discriminated against.\"", "From that exchange, what caught PunditFact's attention is that\u00a0Obama isn't practicing what he preaches in the White House.", "So what do the facts say?", "At a baseline level, there is a gender pay gap in the White House.\u00a0Each year, the president\u2019s office publishes a list of all staff members, the jobs they hold and their pay. With a little commonsense and a bit of Googling (we now know that Brayden is an Irish boys name), we sorted the most recent list of 460 employees\u00a0by gender.", "We found that the average female staff member made $78,767 in 2013, while the average male made $85,602. The Washington Post did its own analysis and came up with slightly different numbers, but no matter how you cut it, a difference exists. In round figures, the average woman makes about 10 percent less than the average man. (One detail: Just about all the staffers are listed as employees, but about 6 percent are on loan as it were from other agencies. They are listed as detailees and their pay is not set by the White House. It does have some impact on the numbers. For the record, we included all workers in our analysis.)", "So there is a pay gap.", "But\u00a0the context of the comments made by Obama at the State of the Union, and then by Fiorina, go beyond that a pay gap exists. The suggestion is that it exists out of some level of discrimination. Put another way, women are paid less than men for doing the same job.", "We found no real evidence of that happening at the White House.", "When we matched men and women by their job titles, not only did the gap disappear, the edge went to the women. This table shows how things break down for two higher echelon titles, \"assistant to the president\" and \"senior policy adviser.\"", "Job Title", "# Men", "Average pay", "# Women", "Average pay", "Assistant to the president", "12", "$170,141", "10", "$172,270", "Senior policy adviser", "7", "$106,714", "9", "$107,442", "In cases where the titles match completely, as with the \"deputy assistant to the president and deputy counsel to the president,\" the salaries were identical. The three men and one woman holding those jobs in 2013 all made $158,500.", "Same thing with \"analyst.\" We found 15 men and women with the title analyst all making $42,000 a year. A man and woman with the title \"assistant counsel of ethics\" both earning $60,000 a year. Five men and women\u00a0with the title \"assistant\u00a0director\" making $50,000 a year. Another five men and women with the title \"coordinator\" making $45,000 a year.", "But not all titles matched up\u00a0so easily.\u00a0The title of \"deputy assistant to the president\" comes with a range of add-on titles. There was a \"deputy assistant to the president and deputy director of communications,\" and a \"deputy assistant to the president and director of the White House military office.\" If we ignored the add-ons, we found that the average female deputy assistant made $141,562, or about $10,000 less than the average male deputy assistant who made $150,115.", "And within titles, we did see some pay gaps -- in both directions. A woman with the title \"director of operations\" made $30,000 a year more than her male counterpart. A male with the title \"calligrapher\" made about $9,000 a year more than a female with the same title. (There's also a chief calligrapher, in case you were wondering.)", "\"Equal pay means equal pay for equal work and that's what we have at the White House,\" a White House spokesman told PunditFact. \"Men and women in the White House in equivalent roles earn equivalent salaries.\"", "He added that department heads all make the same salary and over half are women.", "The numbers are clear. By the standard that men and women doing the same jobs should get the same pay, the Obama White House makes the grade.", "When we reached Fiorina\u2019s office, we learned that her comment emerged out of a running Republican dispute with the administration over its talking points on this issue. Fiorina had something very particular in mind when she referred to Obama\u2019s \"own measures.\"", "Back in April, Obama marked Equal Pay Day by signing executive orders that imposed new rules for federal contractors. A line in the press release said, \"Women still make just 77 cents on average for every dollar a man earns, and continue to face prejudice in the workplace. And that number hasn\u2019t improved \u2014 the pay gap has stayed constant since 2002.\"", "Republicans, including Fiorina, find the 77 cents figure to be a deceptive rallying cry, precisely because it ignores that women and men tend to hold different jobs than men and those jobs tend to be lower paying. They argued that by that standard, the White House is not much better than the average employer.", "\"When the White House talks about equal pay for women they use one set of math for themselves and one set for others,\" said Fiorina spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores. \"The president uses this statistic to compare the average pay of women in all jobs to the average pay of men in all jobs. But when applying this rhetoric to assess pay in the Obama White House, they cry foul.\"", "In that regard, Fiorina has a point.", "PolitiFact rated a claim from Obama Mostly False that, \"Women (are) paid 77 cents on the dollar for doing the same work as men.\" The rationale: The gap isn\u2019t all because women are paid less for doing the same work. A large part of the gap exists because women and men are doing different work.", "But when the claim\u00a0changes even slightly, it becomes more true. In 2014, Obama said simply that Women \"make 77 cents for every dollar a man earns.\" That rated Mostly True because it removes the idea that the pay gap is solely related to discrimination.", "This year, Obama was careful with his wording as well, simply saying that \"this Congress still needs to pass a law that makes sure a woman is paid the same as a man for doing the same work.\"", "And all Fiorina said was Obama was not paying women equally \"by his own measures.\"", "Linda Babcock is an economics professor at Carnegie Mellon University and a leading researcher on women in the workforce. Babcock told PunditFact that the pay gap at the White House and across the country is rooted in occupational segregation. Women tend to hold positions that pay less than men.", "\"We\u2019ve made good progress on equal pay for equal work,\" Babcock said. \"But that\u2019s not fixing the whole problem. You look at any kind of organization and you will see relatively more women at the bottom and relatively more men at the top.\"", "Babcock said research has found that many factors lie behind this. She said men are more likely to have more senior, more powerful advocates for them inside organizations. Babcock also noted than when deciding whether to promote someone, managers tend to be risk averse.", "\"We are more uncertain about women and we force them to meet a higher bar of performance before they go up to the next level,\" \u00a0Babcock said.", "Our ruling", "Fiorina said that Obama is not paying women equally in his own White House by \"his own measures.\"", "That by \"his own measures\" in some ways is the key to this claim, though you wouldn\u2019t necessarily know it by just reading Fiorina\u2019s comment.", "Fiorina is trying to reference past occasions when Obama said that \"women (are) paid 77 cents on the dollar for doing the same work as men.\" That\u2019s Mostly False, because the pay gap is not all about discrimination.", "But the framing of the discussion post-State of the Union was different. Obama said, \"this Congress still needs to pass a law that makes sure a woman is paid the same as a man for doing the same work.\"", "Fiorina followed with, \"Every woman across the nation agrees that equal pay for equal work is absolutely required,\" and then, Obama\u2019s \"not paying women equally by his own measures in his own White House.\"", "The latest White House staffing data shows that there is a gap in average pay for men and women. But when the job titles are the same, largely so is the pay. In fact, for some job categories, women do a bit better than men.", "Fiorina\u2019s dispute had to do with past rhetoric, not the issue as she framed it.", "We rate the claim Mostly False.", "MSNBC, Morning Joe, Jan. 21, 2015", "Mediaite, Carly Fiorina to Valerie Jarrett: Shouldn\u2019t Equal Pay Start at the White House?, Jan. 21, 2015", "Weekly Standard, Valerie Jarrett Confronted Over Unequal Pay for Women in White House, Jan. 21, 2015", "White House, 2013 Report on White House staff, 2014", "Washington Post, Male-female pay gap remains entrenched at White House, July 1, 2014", "Harvard Business Review, Women in the Workplace: A Research Roundup, September 2013", "PolitiFact, Barack Obama's 2015 State of the Union address: annotated, Jan. 21, 2015", "White House, Taking Action in Honor of National Equal Pay Day, April 8, 2014", "PolitiFact, Barack Obama ad says women are paid \"77 cents on the dollar for doing the same work as men\", June 21, 2012", "Interview, Sarah Isgur Flores, spokeswoman for Carly Fiorina, Jan. 21, 2015", "Interview, Linda Babcock, professor of economics, Carnegie Mellon University, Jan. 22, 2015", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
