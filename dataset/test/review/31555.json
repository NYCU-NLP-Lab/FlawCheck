And it makes you feel so important. And you get to punish America for being so successful by doing these stupid deals. But if you read the facts about the high temperatures, about the reality of our past, it is all B.S.\"", "Gutfeld made the statement on The Five as the panel discussed President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to pull out of the Paris climate agreement.", "We interviewed several scientists who said Gutfeld\u2019s statement -- that temperature increases are within the margin of error and therefore not increasing -- \u00a0is wrong. Rather than point to \"single year\" increases, experts said that long-term trends clearly show the temperature has been rising for decades.", "Robert Jackson, chair of the department of Earth System Science at Stanford, said Gutfeld\u2019s statement, scientifically speaking, \"is rubbish.\"", "There are two main sources of data cited to look at temperature trends: the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the NASA Goddard institute for Space Studies. Both show a trend of rising temperatures.", "Rising temperatures should be measured over many years", "A Fox News spokeswoman sent us articles stating that 2016 data on rising temperatures was deceptive because of \"uncertainty in the statistics\" or because news reports hid information on the margin of error.", "Gutfeld focused on \"single year\" increases.", "Such comparisons don\u2019t tell the full story about rising temperature, because there is natural variability year over year. It is more useful to look at long-term trends such as comparing decades, said University of Miami\u2019s Ben Kirtman.", "The statement by Gutfeld \"indicates a profound misunderstanding of climate science and statistics,\" Kirtman said.", "\"Year over year you can\u2019t be sure that one year is a statistically separate warming from the previous year, so you have to take a little bit longer view to remove some of the natural fluctuation,\" he said.", "But by looking at climate data over decades, it shows a clear rise in temperatures.

But 2015 broke that record well outside the uncertainty, and then 2016 further broke that record, again well outside any uncertainty. \u00a0So 2014-16 are the warmest three years on record, he said.", "Reto A. Ruedy, an expert at NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, said Gutfeld\u2019s statement \"lacks any logic.\"", "\"It argues that anything that changes less than the margin of error within some arbitrarily selected time interval (here a year) necessarily does not change,\" he said. \"By the same logic you can argue that babies don\u2019t grow in size, since within a day or even a week they grow less than the margin of error in determining their size.\"", "The long-term trend which shows an overall rise in temperature since 1880, said Mark Serreze, director of the National Snow and Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado.", "\"Gutfeld uses flawed logic to claim that there is no trend. But there is a trend,\" he said. \u00a0\"The lesson here? \u00a0Always look at the actual data.\"", "Our ruling", "Gutfeld said, \"every single year that there's an increase (in temperature) it's within the margin of error -- meaning it isn't increasing.\"", "While some years are within the margin, others definitely\u00a0aren't, so Gutfeld is wrong when he says \"every single\" year is within the margin of error.
