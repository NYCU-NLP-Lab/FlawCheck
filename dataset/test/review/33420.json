The agency\u00a0aims to drain about 1.2 million acre feet of water from the reservoir over the next day or so. The capacity of the reservoir, California\u2019s second-largest, is about 35 million feet.", "Gov. Jerry Brown declared an emergency to beef up the state\u2019s response to the evacuations and dam threat.", "Shortly after news about the damaged dam broke, the Sacramento\u00a0Dispatch web site published an article reporting that President Trump had refused to provide federal aid to California, due to the existence of sanctuary cities within the state:", "A\u00a0high ranking unnamed source, who spoke with the Dispatch on the condition of anonymity, has confirmed that President Trump has denied the request on grounds that California, and the city of Sacramento in particular, have failed to enforce federal immigration laws and have threatened to succeed from the Union. \u00a0The source is quoted as saying:", "\u201cThe President has no incentive in helping the state of California. \u00a0The state harbors more illegal immigrants than any other state and has multiple sanctuary cities that violate\u00a0federal laws. \u00a0 The state very publicly supported Hillary Clinton throughout the election and the President views the state as being responsible for his loss in the popular vote, something he has had trouble with accepting. \u00a0They have also recently threatened to leave the Union through their #CalExit campaign, and the President sees this as an opportunity to let them deal with the consequences of their exit. \u00a0There is a sickness within the liberals in this country that they are not willing to address. \u00a0Until they understand what ails them can they hope to find the cure. \u00a0This is a step in the right direction in finding the #CureForWellness.\u00a0\u201c", "The\u00a0Sacramento Dispatch did not point to any official statement released by the Trump administration, instead basing their article on a quote from a single unnamed source. As of this writing, no legitimate publications have reported that President Trump refused to provide federal aid to California, nor does information about the alleged refusal appear on FEMA's news releases page.", "Although the Sacramento\u00a0Dispatch web site mimics that of real newspapers and does not identify itself as fake news, the site has a track record for publishing hoaxes (e.g., reporting that the American Medical Association had classified \"Trump Depression Disorder\" as a new disease).", "The Sacramento\u00a0Dispatch web site appears to be part of a new network of fake news sites that masquerade as the online outlets of big-city newspapers. Other entries in this fake news network include the Houston Leader and the\u00a0Salt Lake City Guardian web sites, all of whom use nearly identical web formats, share verbatim site descriptions, and republish one another's articles in an attempt to legitimize their fake news stories:", "(The curious use of the #CureForWellness hashtag in the article in question has led some readers to surmise that this network of fake news sites is tied to the release of the psychological horror thriller film A Cure for Wellness.)", "Although President Trump has not refused to provide federal aid to California, he also hasn't yet approved Governor Brown's request for it.

The order also authorizes state funding through the California Disaster Assistance Act for 34 counties impacted by the storms and directs the California Department of Transportation to formally request immediate assistance through the Federal Highway Administration's Emergency Relief Program for Amador and Riverside counties.", "It should be noted that Brown's request for aid was made prior to issuance of the evacuation order.
