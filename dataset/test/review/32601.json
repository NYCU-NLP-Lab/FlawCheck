["About this rating", "The five-person city council of St. Louis Park, Minnesota, which is located in Rep. Ilhan Omar's U.S. congressional district, voted to stop saying the pledge of allegiance before most city council meetings.", "The implication fostered by headlines and social media that Ilhan Omar was in any way involved in that decision is false.", "On June 30, 2019, the conservative commentary site Daily Wire (along with several other news outlets) ran a story with an entirely factual headline: \u201cCity In Ilhan Omar\u2019s Congressional District Votes To Eliminate Pledge Of Allegiance For Meetings.\u201d The city in question was St. Louis Park. That city is, as well-documented in Daily Wire\u2019s reporting, located in Minnesota\u2019s 5th Congressional District. And that district is indeed represented in the U.S. House of Representatives by Ilhan Omar, an immigrant from Somalia and one of the few Muslims serving in Congress.", "Omar, whose name is often invoked for the purpose of fomenting Islamophobic fear mongering, had nothing to do with this decision. That decision was made by five individuals who are not Ilhan Omar, as described in local news report from June 26:", "\u201cIn order to create a more welcoming environment to a diverse community, we are going to forgo saying the Pledge of Allegiance before every meeting,\u201d said Council Member Tim Brausen. At the meeting, Brausen said members might recite it in the future if there\u2019s an appropriate opportunity, like if Boy Scouts are there. ... The change was approved unanimously by city council in a 5 to 0 vote. It will take effect on July 15.", "Still, Daily Wire\u2019s social media postings misleadingly combined Omar\u2019s name and face with a quote from someone (St. Louis Park Ward 2 council member Anne Mavity) who is not Omar:", "This led many readers and social media users to accuse Omar of disrespecting America, at times producing not-so-veiled threats against her life on Daily Wire\u2019s own Facebook page:", "As accurately stated in these articles, five city council members in St Louis Park voted to stop saying the pledge of allegiance before most city council meetings. None of those people, despite gratuitous use of her name and image in social media and in headlines, was Ilhan Omar.", "Saavedra, Ryan. \u00a0 \u201cCity In Ilhan Omar\u2019s Congressional District Votes To Eliminate Pledge Of Allegiance For Meetings.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Daily Wire. \u00a0 30 June 2019.", "govtrack.us. \u00a0 \u201cMinnesota\u2019s 5th District.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Accessed 9 June 2019.", "omar.house.gov. \u00a0 \u201cUnited States Representative Ilhan Omar.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Accessed 9 June 2019.", "McGuire, Mary. \u00a0 \u201cSt. Louis Park City Council Eliminates Pledge Of Allegiance For Meetings.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 CBS Minnesota. \u00a0 26 June 2019.", "KARE NBC 11. \u00a0 \u201cSt. Louis Park City Council Will No Longer Say the Pledge of Allegiance at Public Meetings.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 26 June 2019.", "Alex Kasprak is an investigative journalist and science writer reporting on scientific misinformation, online fraud, and financial crime.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
