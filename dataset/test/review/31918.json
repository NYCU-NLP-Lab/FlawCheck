["About this rating", "U.S. President Donald Trump earns some income from three family trusts that are administered independently by J.P. Morgan, an investment bank and  wealth-management firm. These trusts are in part invested in mutual funds that themselves are partially invested in companies that produce hydroxychloroquine.", "Trump\u2019s financial stake in these companies is virtually negligible \u2014 contained indirectly via mutual funds \u2014 and administered through three family trusts he does not control. As a generic drug, hydroxychloroquine is unlikely to provide any one company with significant profits compared to other proprietary drugs.", "Snopes is still fighting an \u201cinfodemic\u201d of rumors and misinformation surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, and you can help.

The notion gained significant traction when The New York Times reported that Trump has \"a small personal financial interest in Sanofi,\" a French company that makes the brand-name version of hydroxychloroquine. \"If hydroxychloroquine becomes an accepted treatment,\" the Times reported, \"several pharmaceutical companies stand to profit, including shareholders and senior executives with connections to the president.\"", "Strictly speaking, Trump does have a small, personal financial interest in Sanofi, as well as other relevant pharmaceutical companies. According to his most recent financial-disclosure report, Trump earns income from three family trusts, each of which are, in part, invested in mutual funds whose earnings come from a shared pool of investments. In some cases, these funds include minor holdings in pharmaceutical companies, including Sanofi. These family trusts are, according to his disclosure forms, administered without Trump\u2019s input by J.P Morgan, an investment bank and financial-services firm. Neither Trump nor J.P. Morgan controls what stocks these funds are invested in at any given time.", "To highlight the limited financial investment in these companies, we can look at the example provided by the Times. The Times' reporting was based on three Trump family trusts that are each invested in the Dodge & Cox International Stock Fund. At the time of our reporting, this fund was 3.3 percent invested in Sanofi. As reported by MarketWatch\u2019s Steve Goldstein, this represents at most $1,485 worth of Sanofi shares in total:", "Trump\u2019s 2019 financial-disclosure form lists stakes in Family Trusts 1, 2 and 3 valued at between $1,001 and $15,000. So if Trump has the maximum $15,000 in each of the trusts, he holds a stake in Sanofi that\u2019s worth $1,485 \u2014 and, at the minimum, just $99.", "Trump, in each of those three family trusts, is invested in another fund that also has a minor stake in Sanofi. At the time of this reporting, that fund \u2014 iShares Core MSCI EAFE ETF \u2014 is 0.67 percent invested in Sanofi. Using the same math from above, this represents at most $1,005 worth of shares in Sanofi and as little as $ 301. Combined, the highest possible amount of Sanofi stock Trump is indirectly invested in here is $2,490 dollars \u2014 negligible when compared to the totality of the president\u2019s other holdings.", "It is unclear why the Times focused on Sanofi in its story. Trump is similarly invested in the pharmaceutical company Novartis via those same funds. Novartis manufactures hydroxychloroquine through their generics division Sandoz. Further, Trump \u2014 again via these same funds \u2014 is invested in several other pharmaceutical companies, too, and each of them could conceivably manufacture the drug as well. Indeed, this is one of the central problems with the notion that Trump\u2019s fervor for hydroxychloroquine stems from a financial interest \u2014 it\u2019s simply not a profitable drug.", "As a generic drug, any qualified company can be approved by the FDA to produce hydroxychloroquine \u2014 no single entity, be it Sanofi or Novartis or any other company, has exclusive financial rights to the drug. This limits companies\u2019 abilities to raise its price and means several companies are currently able to produce it. It also means no guarantee exists that any specific company, regardless of Trump\u2019s investment or lack thereof, would necessarily become the major supplier of the drug in the United States. Ami Fadia, a financial analyst focusing on the pharmaceutical industry at the investment bank SVB Leerink, argued in a report that the drug is \"unlikely to be a financial driver\" due to its generic status.", "Because Trump\u2019s financial interest in Sanofi and other pharmaceutical companies is indirect and minor, and because hydroxychloroquine is an easily produced generic drug unlikely to drive profit, we rank the claim that his promotion of the drug could lead to potential financial benefits as \"Mostly false.\"", "Wong, Julia C. \u00a0 \"Hydroxychloroquine: How an Unproven Drug Became Trump\u2019s Coronavirus 'Miracle Cure'.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The Guardian. \u00a0 7 April 2020.", "Baker, Peter, et al. \u00a0 \"Trump\u2019s Aggressive Advocacy of Malaria Drug for Treating Coronavirus Divides Medical Community.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 New York Times. \u00a0 6 April 2020.", "U.S. Office of Government Ethics. \u00a0 \u201cExecutive Branch Personnel Public Financial Disclosure Report (OGE Form 278e) - Donald J.
