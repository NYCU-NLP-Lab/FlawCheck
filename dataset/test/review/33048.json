The man who performed the \u2018exorcism\u2019 was a pastor named Dinesh Sahu. He hails from a town named Chipli in Kabirdham district. Sahu had been taking advantage of people\u2019s superstitions by using torturous methods to help those who believed to be possessed by ghosts. His methods had angered the residents of his town therefore, he eventually fled to Santoshi Nagar. The police arrested Sahu after the video of him beating the minor girl went viral.
