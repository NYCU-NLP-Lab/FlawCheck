["Bernie Sanders still doesn\u2019t want to talk about Hillary Clinton\u2019s damn emails.", "Asked for his reaction to the State Department report of Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server, Sanders told Meet the Press\u2019 Chuck Todd that he\u2019d rather talk policy differences.", "\"Our campaign is about defeating Secretary Clinton on the real issues,\" he responded. \"I want to break up the Wall Street banks. She doesn\u2019t. I want to raise the minimum wage to 15 bucks an hour. She wants $12 an hour. I voted against the war in Iraq. She voted for the war in Iraq. I believe we should ban fracking.
