Hillary Clinton noted toward the start of a debate with Sen. Barack Obama that she often has to answer the first question in televised debates.

And I don't mind,\" Clinton said during a Feb. 26, 2008, Democratic debate in Cleveland, Ohio. \"You know, I'll be happy to field them, but I do find it curious.
