The video has been circulating on social media for the past one week or more.", "The above clip shows that social media users are actively sharing this video and the accompanying claim. The claim has already been debunked by Boom Live and Shivamogga Live, a regional news outfit of Karnataka but this seems to have had little effect on purveyors of misinformation.
