["About this rating", "On 15 August 2017, the \"satirical\" web site Our Land of the Free published an article with a headline stating that the white supremacist accused of killing a protester days earlier at a neo-Nazi rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, is a Democrat who visited President Obama in the White House.", "The author misidentifies the man accused of a fatal vehicular attack in the body of the article, however, confusing him with the rally's organizer, Jason Kessler:", "Conservative author Dinesh D\u2019Souza uncovered something that blows the Left\u2019s whole narrative to bits. While they have been throwing around claims that the white supremacist who ran over a protester who was blocking the road is a Republican, D\u2019Souza discovered he actually an Obama-supporting Democrat.", "Well, well. The white supremacist organizer of #Charlottesville was an Obama supporter & Occupy Wall Street activist https://t.co/hI5PxNUmb7", "\u2014 Dinesh D'Souza (@DineshDSouza) August 15, 2017", "\u201cRumors abound on white nationalist forums that Kessler\u2019s ideological pedigree before 2016 was less than pure and seem to point to involvement in the Occupy movement and past support for President Obama,\u201d the Southern Poverty Law Center notes in their profile of Kessler.", "To be perfectly clear, the aforementioned Jason Kessler is not the man who drove a car into a group of counter-protesters at the rally, killing one. The person charged with that crime is James Alex Fields, Jr., 20, of Maumee, Ohio. Kessler was the primary organizer of what he described as the \"pro-white demonstration\" in Charlottesville.", "Moreover, the photo presented by Our Land of the Free as evidence that Kessler is a Democrat is one of the more ludicrous digital manipulation jobs we've encountered in awhile:", "Kessler didn\u2019t just support Obama; he visited the Oval Office in 2016. Here\u2019s a photo of the two of them having a fun chat:", "As best we can tell, that is accused Charlottesville killer James Fields' face (not Jason Kessler's) lamely pasted into the image, but the body doesn't belong to either of them. We located a copy of the original, unaltered photo, taken by official Obama White House photographer Pete Souza, and found that it documented an Oval Office encounter between President Obama, comedian Will Ferrell, and Ferrell's wife, Viveca in October 2011:", "We believe in the right to be free.

In fact, it most definitely is not. Our Land Of The Free is here to entertain you with the kind of whimsical satire conservatives enjoy.", "Potentially confusing for inattentive readers will be the fact that some of the untrustworthy sites reposting the article (Patriot USA and News Feed Observer, to name two) carry no such disclaimer. Regardless of where you read it, the story is false.", "Bertrand, Natasha. \u00a0\u00a0\"Here's What We Know About the 'Pro-White' Organizer of 'Unite the Right,' Who Was Chased Out of His Own Press Conference.\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Business Insider. \u00a0\u00a014 August 2017.", "Bromwich, Jonah Engel and Blinder, Alan. \u00a0\u00a0\"What We Know About James Alex Fields, Driver Charged in Charlottesville Killing.\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The New York Times. \u00a0\u00a013 August 2017.", "McDevitt, Caitlin. \u00a0\u00a0\"Why Will Ferrell Missed Obama's Fundraiser.\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Politico. \u00a0\u00a021 February 2012.", "Our Land of the Free.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"White Supremacist Who Killed Protester Is a Democrat And Visited Obama In Oval Office.\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a015 August 2017.", "Clarification: The face pasted into the image, which we initially identified as Jason Kessler's, appears instead to be that of James Alex Fields, Jr.", "David Emery is a West Coast-based writer and editor with 25 years of experience fact-checking rumors, hoaxes, and contemporary legends.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
