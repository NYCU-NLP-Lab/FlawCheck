(Mike De Sisti photo)", "In an Aug. 11, 2016 tweet that was augmented with a bit of animation (a counter with rolling numbers), House Speaker Paul Ryan declared:", "\"President Obama\u2019s proposed oil tax would cost consumers 24 cents a gallon.\"", "That\u2019s a flat declaration of a specific figure.", "Let\u2019s see if it\u2019s on the money.", "Ryan\u2019s evidence", "To back Ryan\u2019s statement, his office cited a February 2016 article from MarketWatch.com, which reported on Obama\u2019s proposal for a $10 \u00a0tax on each barrel of oil to pay for \"clean\" transportation projects such as expanding mass transit. The article said the tax would be paid by oil companies and gradually phased in over five years.", "To be clear, the article said the proposal \"isn\u2019t expected to go far.\" And in a news release Ryan issued the same day as his tweet, he said the tax is \"dead on arrival in Congress.\"", "The MarketWatch article quoted Patrick DeHaan, senior petroleum analyst at GasBuddy.com, as saying: \"This proposal would trickle down and be a $10 per barrel tax on motorists -- or 20 to 25 cents per gallon on refined fuels. To me it\u2019s clear: this is not something oil companies are going to absorb.\"", "So, 24 cents is in the range of the analyst\u2019s estimate. But it\u2019s only one analyst; and his estimate is based on how he thinks oil companies would respond to a $10-per-barrel tax.", "What the oil companies would do isn\u2019t quite as certain as what Ryan claimed.", "A trade group that should know, the American Petroleum Institute, warned the tax would \"harm consumers.\" But it hedged a bit in saying the tax \"could\" raise the cost of gasoline by 25 cents a gallon.", "Economist Nicolas Loris estimated the cost slightly lower, at 22 cents, the Huffington Post said 22 to 24 cents, and the Washington Post said 24 cents. Politico and Forbes said about 25 cents.", "One note: The federal government currently imposes a tax of 18.4 cents per gallon of gasoline. But that\u2019s a direct tax on gas, not on the oil companies.", "Our rating", "Ryan said: \"President Obama\u2019s proposed oil tax would cost consumers 24 cents a gallon.\"", "Estimates are in the 24 cents range for the $10-per-barrel tax that Obama proposed on oil companies. But it\u2019s not a sure thing, if the tax became law, that all of the tax would be passed onto consumers.", "We rate the statement Mostly True.", "Twitter, Paul Ryan tweet,\u00a0Aug. 11, 2016", "Speaker.gov, \"news release, Aug. 11, 2016", "Email, Paul Ryan spokesman Ian Martorana, Aug. 12, 2016", "Email, White House spokeswoman Kaelan Richards, Aug. 12, 2016", "MarketWatch.com, \"Here\u2019s how much Obama\u2019s oil tax would add to the price of gasoline,\" Feb. 7, 2016", "The Daily Signal, \"Obama\u2019s New Oil Tax Would Hike Gas Prices 22 Cents a Gallon,\" Feb. 5, 2016.", "American Petroleum Institute, news release, Feb. 4, 2016", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
