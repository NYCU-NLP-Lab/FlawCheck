But why aren't Crooked Hillary & the Dems the focus?????", "The Justice Department indicted Manafort on 12 counts, primarily money laundering and false statements, none of which involved his work for Trump. The oldest of the allegations date back to activities that began\u00a0in 2006, but three occurred in 2016 and 2017.", "Manafort\u2019s more recent actions undercut Trump\u2019s statement. The White House did not respond to a request for comment.", "In March 2016, then-candidate Trump tapped Manafort to manage the Republican National Convention.

The work continued briefly after Yanukovych was forced from office.", "The grand jury indictment alleges that in order to hide the money from the U.S. government, Manafort and Gates \"laundered the money through scores of United States and foreign corporations, partnerships and back accounts.\" Manafort used \"his hidden overseas wealth to enjoy a lavish lifestyle in the United States.\" He bought \"multi-million dollar properties\" and then \"borrowed millions of dollars in loans using these properties as collateral, thereby obtaining cash in the United States without reporting and paying taxes on the income.\"", "The money-laundering conspiracy is the second count in the indictment.", "The government documented a large number of transactions between 2008 and 2014.

Most of the counts in the indictment detail Manafort\u2019s money laundering efforts dating back to 2006.
