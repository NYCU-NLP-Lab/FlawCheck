["With razor-thin margins in several battleground states and many people \u2014 including President Donald Trump \u2014 pushing unsubstantiated claims of widespread voter fraud, some social media users are pointing to the practice of ballot curing as another Democratic attempt to \u201csteal\u201d the election.", "\u201cFRAUD,\u201d Tyler Zed wrote on Facebook\u00a0on Nov. 4, sharing a screenshot of a tweet from David Litt, a former speechwriter for President Barack Obama, who asked for volunteers to help cure rejected mail-in ballots in Georgia. In the Nov. 4 tweet, Litt shared a link to a Georgia Democrats ballot cure canvassing training.", "The post was widely shared across social media.", "Zed did not return USA TODAY\u2019s request for comment, and his Facebook post has since been deleted.", "At 12:30 p.m. Friday, former Vice President Joe Biden was leading in Georgia by 1,564 votes, with 99% of estimated votes counted.", "More:Fact check: Trump ballots were not thrown out as claimed by fake poll worker", "According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, 18 states require that voters be notified when there\u00a0is a missing signature or signature discrepancy on their mail-in ballot and also be given an opportunity to correct it.", "In Georgia, voters have until three days after the election \u2014 Nov. 6, in 2020 \u2014 to \u201ccure\u201d their rejected ballot by submitting a copy of their identification and an affidavit confirming the ballot is theirs.", "Voters may also need to cure their ballot by providing identification if they voted by provisional ballot, meaning they encountered a problem while voting in-person and election officials needed to determine later whether their vote was eligible.", "One of the most common reasons absentee ballots are rejected in Georgia is because they are not properly signed, according to the state\u2019s website. When that happens, the county elections office contacts the voter with a document to cure, or correct, the ballot envelope.", "In Georgia, 1,960 mail-in ballots were rejected this election, accounting for a 0.1% rejection rate, according to early voting analysis from The United States Elections Project, which is operated by University of Florida political science professor Michael McDonald.

Most counties are almost done counting their outstanding absentee ballots, she said.", "Common Cause Georgia requests lists of provisional voters from individual counties, and then volunteers reach out to those voters via text banking, phone banking or door-to-door knocking to inform them how they can cure their ballots, Dennis explained. On Friday, the organization hopes to reach 3,000 voters\u00a0who cast provisional ballots, she said.", "\u201cIt\u2019s a big effort, but we want to make sure that every vote in Georgia counts,\u201d Dennis said, adding, \u201cWe want to make sure that every voter has equitable access to the ballot and to the balloting process, and every vote is counted in Georgia.\u201d", "More:Georgia Election Results 2020: Live Updates", "Responding to claims that ballot curing is equivalent to election fraud, Dennis said, \u201cthe curing process has been accessible for public viewing, so we definitely want to debunk those claims. That\u2019s just fodder, and there\u2019s no basis to those claims.\u201d", "Georgia voters have until 5 p.m. Friday to cure rejected ballots and can check the status of their mail-in or provisional ballot through the state\u2019s website. However, the state\u2019s election results won\u2019t be certified until Nov. 13.", "\u201cWe\u2019re telling people to remain patient around our process, because our process is actually working,\u201d Dennis said. \u201cWe need to allow the time to let the process work to make sure that every ballot is counted.\u201d", "Based on our research, we rate this claim as FALSE. Ballot curing is a legal process in Georgia and many other states, a method of ensuring that voters who cast their ballots on time for Election Day have a chance to see their vote counted.
