["By Jessica McDonald", "Posted on February 19, 2021 | Updated on May 19, 2021", "A tweet shared on Instagram baselessly claims that a person is 300 to 900 times more likely to die \u201cafter getting the #Covid vaccine than the flu vaccine.\u201d\u00a0 But the comparison is faulty \u2014 and there is no proof that people are dying from COVID-19 vaccines.", "No vaccine or medical product is 100% safe, but the safety of vaccines is ensured via rigorous testing in clinical trials prior to authorization or approval, followed by continued safety monitoring once the vaccine is rolled out to the public to detect potential rare side effects. In addition, the Food and Drug Administration inspects vaccine production facilities and reviews manufacturing protocols to make sure vaccine doses are of high-quality and free of contaminants.", "One key vaccine safety surveillance program is the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, or VAERS, which is an early warning system run by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and FDA. As its website explains, VAERS \u201cis not designed to detect if a vaccine caused an adverse event, but it can identify unusual or unexpected patterns of reporting that might indicate possible safety problems requiring a closer look.\u201d", "Anyone can submit a report to VAERS for any health problem that occurs after an immunization. There is no screening or vetting of the report and no attempt to determine if the vaccine was responsible for the problem. The information is still valuable because it\u2019s a way of being quickly alerted to a potential safety issue with a vaccine, which can then be followed-up by government scientists.", "Another monitoring system is the CDC\u2019s Vaccine Safety Datalink, which uses electronic health data from nine health care organizations in the U.S. to identify adverse events related to vaccination in near real time.", "In the case of the COVID-19 vaccines, randomized controlled trials involving tens of thousands of people, which were reviewed by multiple groups of experts, revealed no serious safety issues and showed that the benefits outweigh the risks.", "The CDC and FDA vaccine safety monitoring systems, which were expanded for the COVID-19 vaccines and also include a new smartphone-based reporting tool called v-safe, have subsequently identified only a few, very rare adverse events.", "For more, see \u201cHow safe are the vaccines?\u201d", "Link to this", "All of the authorized and approved vaccines are effective at preventing severe COVID-19.", "Against earlier forms of the coronavirus, the vaccines were highly effective at preventing symptomatic illness. For example, clinical trials for the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna mRNA vaccines and the protein-based Novavax vaccine found each reduced the risk of getting sick by more than 90%.", "Subsequent studies have demonstrated that the vaccines are effective under real-world conditions.\u00a0Against omicron variants, however, the vaccines haven\u2019t fared\u00a0as well and are much worse at preventing infection or mild disease. The shots are still good at preventing hospitalization or death, though, particularly if someone stays up-to-date on vaccination.", "Starting in September 2023, the Food and Drug Administration approved or authorized updated 2023-2024\u00a0vaccines that target the latest prevalent omicron variants. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends\u00a0these vaccines for everyone 6 months or older.\u00a0For more on these shots, see our \u201cQ&A on the Updated COVID-19 Vaccines.\u201d", "Link to this", "A Feb. 15 tweet, subsequently shared on Instagram, cites unvetted information submitted to a federal database to baselessly claim that COVID-19 vaccines are significantly more dangerous than influenza vaccines. Experts, however, say that\u2019s a misuse of the numbers \u2014 and the suggestion that COVID-19 vaccines are killing one in every 10,000 immunized people is groundless.", "\u201cHow much more likely are you to die after getting the #Covid vaccine than the flu vaccine?\u201d the tweet, from novelist and former New York Times reporter Alex Berenson, begins.", "\u201c300-900 times, based on federal VAERS reports. Yes, 900,\u201d he answers, referring to the government\u2019s Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, adding that for COVID-19 vaccines, it\u2019s \u201c1 death reported per 35,000 shots or 10,000 completed vaccinations (so far),\u201d but for flu \u201c1 death per 9,000,000 vaccinations.\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s a safe vaccine,\u201d Berenson then says of the flu vaccine. \u201cThose deaths are likely coincidental, a simple result of the number of shots given. The #Covid vax, not so much.\u201d", "But\u00a0Berenson\u2019s analysis relies on the fallacy that any death that occurs after vaccination must be related to the vaccine.", "\u201cVAERS does not determine death, period,\u201d a spokesperson for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told us. \u201cJust because somebody reports death doesn\u2019t mean that the vaccine caused the death. So we don\u2019t use VAERS to determine death rates or anything concerning death.\u201d", "In terms of the number of death reports following each vaccine at the time of his tweet, Berenson\u2019s numbers check out. The CDC, for example, had written on its website that as of Feb. 7, 1,170 deaths had been reported to VAERS following the administration of 41 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines. That\u2019s around one report per 35,000 doses. (The number listed on the website is now 934 death reports out of 52 million doses, through Feb. 14; a CDC spokesperson said the decline is because the agency switched to include only domestic reports to match the number of doses administered in the U.S.)", "But the comparison to flu is problematic, and the conclusion that COVID-19 vaccines are therefore unsafe is unfounded.", "Reports through VAERS do not necessarily mean that a vaccine caused the adverse event, as anyone can submit reports, regardless of whether an immunization is thought to have contributed. When deaths following receipt of a vaccine are reported, CDC and Food and Drug Administration physicians review those cases \u2014 and so far with the COVID-19 vaccines, there has been no link with immunization.", "A CDC spokesperson told us that to date, the agency has not received confirmation of a single COVID-19 vaccine-related death.", "Update, May 19: After\u00a0investigating\u00a015 cases of a rare clotting condition out of nearly 8 million Johnson & Johnson vaccinations, the CDC and Food and Drug Administration\u00a0are\u00a0warning\u00a0of a suggested increased risk of the dangerous condition, which occurred in women and resulted in three deaths as of April 21. The CDC\u00a0says\u00a0\u201cwomen younger than 50 years old especially should be aware of the rare risk of blood clots with low platelets after vaccination, and that other COVID-19 vaccines are available where this risk has not been seen.\u201d As of May 11, 28 cases\u00a0had been identified\u00a0out of more than 9 million J&J vaccines administered. For more, see \u201cQ&A on the Rare Clotting Events That Caused the J&J Pause.\u201d", "Moreover, experts said it\u2019s not surprising that more death reports would be submitted to VAERS after COVID-19 immunizations compared with flu, given the increased attention on the vaccine.", "\u201cThe difference in deaths reported following COVID-19 vaccine and flu vaccine administration is likely due to the enhanced reporting of all events occurring after COVID vaccination compared to after influenza vaccination,\u201d Dr. Robert Legare Atmar, an infectious disease specialist at Baylor College of Medicine who also evaluates vaccines, told us.", "Berenson, who frequently appears on conservative media, has previously misinterpreted a study to suggest that face masks are ineffective against the novel coronavirus. His tweets have formed the basis of another misleading claim online, also citing VAERS data, about adverse reactions to COVID-19 vaccines relative to flu vaccines.", "To understand why Berenson\u2019s scary-seeming statistics should not be alarming, it\u2019s useful to know how VAERS works and the limitations of its data.", "As its website explains, VAERS is an early warning system that \u201cis not designed to detect if a vaccine caused an adverse event, but it can identify unusual or unexpected patterns of reporting that might indicate possible safety problems requiring a closer look.\u201d", "The system accepts any report of a reaction that occurs after an immunization. There is no screening or vetting of the report and submissions are accepted \u201cwithout judging whether the event was caused by the vaccine.\u201d\u00a0A disclaimer users must read before accessing the public data therefore warns that reports \u201cmay include incomplete, inaccurate, coincidental and unverified information,\u201d and notes that the utility of the data is limited because most reporting is voluntary.", "The information is still valuable because it\u2019s a way of being quickly alerted to a potential safety problem with a vaccine, which government scientists\u00a0can then\u00a0investigate.\u00a0In the case of COVID-19 vaccines, VAERS is just one of several vaccine safety monitoring systems the government has in place to ensure the safety of the vaccine as it\u2019s rolled out to a wider population.", "But VAERS data isn\u2019t meant to allow safety comparisons between vaccines or to arrive at any sort of estimate of a person\u2019s chances of dying following an immunization. Indeed, the disclaimer specifically cautions against doing the kind of math Berenson performs. \u201cThe number of reports alone cannot be interpreted or used to reach conclusions about the existence, severity, frequency, or rates of problems associated with vaccines,\u201d it reads.", "Instead, a CDC spokesperson said, when a serious adverse event such as death is reported, the agency collects information, including medical records, autopsy reports, death certificates \u2014 and a qualified physician determines the cause of death.", "\u201cWe look for patterns, we look for warning signals \u2014 but we do not use VAERS to determine death or death rates,\u201d she said. \u201cThose have to be verified.\u201d", "Given the way that VAERS works, there are several reasons why there would be more reports of death following a COVID-19 vaccine in the system than for influenza vaccines \u2014 none of which would have anything to do with the vaccine\u2019s actual safety profile.", "\u201cThere\u2019s a heightened awareness of this virus, and hence, heightened awareness of this vaccine,\u201d said Dr. Paul A. Offit, a vaccine expert at the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia and a member of the FDA\u2019s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee reviewing COVID-19 vaccines.", "The COVID-19 vaccines, too, have initially \u201cbeen geared toward an older population that is more likely to have medical problems,\u201d he said. Because the vaccines protect against COVID-19 but were \u201cnot designed to prevent everything else that happens in life,\u201d Offit said, it\u2019s expected that some number of people \u2014 especially the elderly \u2014 will die, entirely coincidentally, after receiving a vaccine. (SciCheck has addressed this before in \u201cVideo Makes Bogus Claims About \u2018War Crimes\u2019 and COVID-19 Vaccine Safety.\u201d)", "The CDC told us that reports of deaths occurring\u00a0after COVID-19 immunization are under investigation, but that from the data thus far, \u201cit appears many of these deaths are among nursing home residents who had serious underlying conditions and death was not hastened by the vaccination.\u201d", "Atmar, of Baylor, who has made recommendations about influenza vaccines as part of the CDC\u2019s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, also said that it\u2019s a mistake to overinterpret the VAERS death reports.", "\u201cPersons with underlying conditions and living in nursing homes/long-term care facilities die of their underlying conditions on a daily basis,\u201d he said in an email. During flu season, those deaths are unlikely to be reported to VAERS because they are not thought to be related to the flu vaccine, he explained. But with COVID-19, whether or not a death is thought to be due to the vaccine or a person\u2019s medical condition, the deaths are being reported to VAERS.", "\u201cThis \u2018biased\u2019 differential in reporting makes it appear that there is a difference in [the] death rate among recipients of the two types of vaccines,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead, what it represents is a difference in reporting.\u201d", "Because COVID-19 vaccines are authorized under an emergency use authorization, there are in fact different reporting requirements to VAERS for the vaccines than for others. As is explained on the VAERS website, health care providers are required to report all deaths that occur after a COVID-19 vaccination, regardless of the suspected cause.", "With other vaccines,\u00a0providers are encouraged to submit reports of death following vaccination, whether or not they believe the vaccine was the cause, but they are\u00a0not required to do so unless the death occurs following a so-called reportable event for the vaccine, such as an allergic anaphylactic reaction.", "Editor\u2019s note: SciCheck\u2019s COVID-19/Vaccination Project is made possible by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.
