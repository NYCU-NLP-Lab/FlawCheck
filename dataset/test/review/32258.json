Both governments have taken precautionary measures including closing schools and banning gatherings to curb the spread of the pandemic.", "Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta has announced fiscal measures to cushion\u00a0the economic impact of the virus, as local media\u00a0reported.", "At the same time, Kenyan media has reported on pleas from citizens\u00a0asking for landlords to pause rent collection because of economic difficulties.
