Second (again, as with traditional polling), the target demographic profile incorporates assumptions about turnout. If they use the all registered voters profile, for example, they are assuming that Hispanics will turn out in the same proportions as others.", "\"That said,\" Smith closed, \"I don\u2019t see any reason not to use them as a credible polling source.\"", "Close match-up?", "Other Texas polls haven\u2019t suggested a 2-point margin in the race though a couple taken since April 2018 came close.", "Daron Shaw, a University of Texas government professor and pollster, responded to us by email that the Civiqs poll aside, \"one could claim that the margin of error surrounding some of the public polls is consistent with the spirit (if not the precise number) of the email\" blast from the Texas GOP.", "Texas polls summarized on the Real Clear Politics website as of mid-July 2018 showed Cruz leading by three to 11 percentage points.

The margin thus varies between Cruz +11 and O\u2019Rourke +5,\" Shaw wrote.", "Similarly, Shaw said, the margin of error in the latest UT/Texas Tribune poll, taken in June 2018, can be read as placing Cruz up between 2 and 8 points.", "Still, Shaw wrote, six public polls taken since spring 2018 show Cruz prevailing by as many as 11 points. \"The chances of this happening if O\u2019Rourke is actually winning is statistically infinitesimal,\" Shaw said.", "Another note: After the April 2018 Quinnipiac results came out, Joshua Blank and Jim Henson of the Texas Politics Project at UT-Austin suggested that historically, spring polls showing closer-than-expected races haven\u2019t played out in November balloting. The pair compiled statewide polling results from April through July for Texas elections going back to 2010 for president, senator and governor. The two concluded that Cruz\u2019s lead in April 2018 wasn\u2019t as stout as one might expert given that Republicans in the past races were leading polls at comparable points by 9 percentage points on average. Still, they wrote, \"there's little evidence from the eventual election results that Cruz's lead isn't likely to grow.\"", "\"The obvious caveat,\" Blank and Henson said, \"is that historical data is good for predicting outcomes where the present can be reasonably said to resemble the past.\"", "Our ruling", "The Republican Party of Texas said a recent poll showed O\u2019Rourke within 2 percentage points of Cruz.", "Through July 4, 2018, Civiqs says, its polling of Texas registered voters placed Cruz with 48 percent support and O\u2019Rourke with 46 percent.
