The image is of an incident that took place in Rajkot, Gujarat. The elderly man in the picture was tied and beaten by the policeman because he was accused of raping his daughter-in-law. In a report by Hindustan Times, dated April 10, 2016, the same image can be seen. Alt News does not endorse such unconstitutional mechanisms of dealing with alleged criminals, however the report below proves that the incident occurred in 2016 and has no relation to what is being claimed on social media.", "Alt News had earlier reported when \u2018I Support Ravish Kumar\u2019 page posted a fake quote, which can be read here.", "A video demonstration of the fact-check can be seen below.", "It is true that the India is going through a period of agricultural crisis and the cases of farmer suicides continue across the length and breadth of the country. Farmer organisations in many parts of India have also taken out protests against government policies, both state and centre. Consequently, there are more than enough pictures which represent the current plight of farmers in India.
