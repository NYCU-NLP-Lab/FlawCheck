Donna Howard, speaking to reporters for the Dallas Morning News during a Facebook Live presentation, brought up condom tax history just after suggesting that ever-costly diapers also should not be subject to the state sales tax of 6.25 percent; local governments are allowed to levy up to 2 percent more of sales tax.", "Condoms, Howard went on, \"used to be tax-exempt here in Texas until we changed something in the statute; the wording was such that it ... put them back out there where they were taxed.\"", "We wondered about that, ultimately finding changes in law against a governor\u2019s wishes resulted in a type of condom not being subject to sales tax for more than seven years--though no longer.", "To gauge this claim, we mostly relied on the Texas state comptroller\u2019s office, which oversees state tax collections.", "By email, spokeswoman Lauren Willis pointed out that a tax-cut package signed into law by Gov.

Starting April 1, 2000, the Morris News Service story said, \"Texans won't have to pay sales tax on non-prescription medications, ointments to treat sunburns, laxatives or condoms.\"", "Before his re-election in 1998, the story said, Bush had proposed a $400 million tax-cut package including a sales tax break on over-the-counter health items although Bush, an advocate of abstinence education for teenagers, had said the cut wouldn\u2019t apply to condoms.", "Seeking re-election, Bush said in September 1998 that his proposed tax cut would not extend to nonprescription contraceptives, including condoms, the\u00a0Morning News reported. \"The governor is being touted by some in the GOP has a potential presidential candidate in 2000,\" the story said, \"and some social conservatives have taken a strong stand against promiscuity and premarital sex.\"", "But in March 2000, State Comptroller Carole Keeton Rylander announced she had no choice but to include condoms among items made tax-exempt in the tax-cut measure passed into law the year before. Calling her decision a \"matter of law,\" Rylander pointed out the new law required a drug, medicine or health care product to be exempt from taxes if it has a drug code number issued pursuant to FDA regulations.

So in building the list of exempt items, Rylander advised, agency staff relied on an FDA list of drugs and medicines and also included items, such as condoms, that fit the state\u2019s statutory definition of a drug or medicine as \"an article or substance applied to, ingested, or inhaled by humans marketed for the use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment or prevention of disease, illness, injury, or pain.\"", "Rylander\u2019s conclusion: The \"medicated prophylactic devices, which aid in the prevention of disease, qualify for the exemption.
