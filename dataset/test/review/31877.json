Robert Menendez is one of hundreds of federal officials responsible for spending taxpayer dollars, but state Sen. Joseph Kyrillos is pinning blame for the nation\u2019s rising annual deficits on the Democratic incumbent.\n\nKyrillos, a Republican representing part of Monmouth County, made that accusation during a Feb. 1 speech announcing his plans to seek the GOP nomination and challenge Menendez, who is seeking re-election.\n\n\"Senator Menendez said he would spend our money wisely,\" Kyrillos told the crowd at the Lincroft Inn. \"But our annual national deficit climbed from $250 billion a year to $1.6 trillion on his watch.\"\n\nFor this fact-check, PolitiFact New Jersey is tackling two related claims made by Kyrillos. The first claim concerns the specific budgetary figures that he cited, and the second claim deals with whether it\u2019s fair to blame Menendez for those deficits.\n\nWe found that Menendez bears some responsibility for the increased deficits, but Kyrillos\u2019 numbers are slightly off and his argument ignores the impact of the recession on federal coffers.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s talk about the deficit figures.\n\nKyrillos spokesman Chapin Fay claimed that the annual deficit increased from about $250 billion in fiscal year 2006 -- when Menendez joined the Senate -- to about $1.6 trillion in fiscal year 2011, which ended in September 2011.\n\nThe number for fiscal year 2006 is accurate, but the fiscal year 2011 figure cited by Kyrillos is not.\n\nFederal officials had estimated an annual deficit of $1.645 trillion for fiscal year 2011, but the actual deficit turned out to be slightly under $1.3 trillion. During Menendez\u2019s tenure in the Senate, the annual deficit reached its highest level in fiscal year 2009, at about $1.4 trillion.\n\nNow, let\u2019s turn to the larger question: how much did Menendez have to do with the rising deficits?\n\nWith regard to the spending increase in fiscal year 2009, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office pointed to three major factors: the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the stimulus); the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP; and payments to mortgage guarantee agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Following its inception, TARP provided federal dollars to financial institutions and automakers.\n\nMenendez voted for the three bills that led to increased spending under those measures.\n\nBut two professors with expertise in federal budgeting also pointed to another major factor behind the rising deficits: the recession. The economic downturn caused a steep drop in revenues at a time when more people were seeking unemployment benefits.\n\n\"But I think it is silly to blame an individual Senator for changes that were fundamentally driven by the worst recession since the 1930s,\" Alan Auerbach, an economics professor at the University of California, Berkeley, said in an e-mail.\n\nDaniel Mitchell, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, also said Kyrillos was giving Menendez \"too much blame.\" Menendez deserves some blame, but members of both parties contributed to the increased deficits.\n\n\"It\u2019s been a bipartisan problem with all of them going along with it,\" Mitchell told us.\n\nFay said Kyrillos believes both parties contributed to the deficit, but maintained that Menendez\u2019s voting record was a significant factor.\n\n\"The deficit has risen dramatically during Sen. Menendez's time in office - and as you cited yourself, he has taken an extraordinary number of votes during that time to increase spending,\" Fay said in an email.", "A spokeswoman for Menendez declined to comment.\n\nOur ruling\n\nDuring his campaign announcement, Kyrillos criticized Menendez by saying \"our annual national deficit climbed from $250 billion a year to $1.6 trillion on his watch.\"\n\nHis numbers are slightly off, because the highest annual deficit during Menendez\u2019s tenure in the Senate was about $1.4 trillion in fiscal year 2009.\n\nMenendez bears some responsibility for the large deficits by supporting various measures such as the stimulus and TARP. But experts told us the recession largely contributed to the deficits, and both parties are to blame for increased spending.\n\nWe rate the statement Half True.", "To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.", "NJToday, Joe Kyrillos Kicks Off U.S. Senate Campaign, Feb. 1, 2012\n\nThe Star-Ledger, As he launches U.S. Senate campaign, Joseph Kyrillos strikes pledge of fiscal restraint, Feb. 2, 2012\n\nPolitiFact New Jersey, Bob Menendez attacked by GOP challenger over federal debt increases, Jan. 8, 2012\n\nCongressional Budget Office, The Budget and Economic Outlook: Fiscal Years 2012 to 2022, January 2012\n\nCongressional Research Service, Reducing the Budget Deficit: Tax Policy Options, April 26, 2011\n\nU.S. Department of the Treasury, Joint Statement of Timothy Geithner, Secretary of the Treasury, and Jacob Lew, Director of the Office of Management And Budget, on Budget Results for Fiscal Year 2011, Oct. 14, 2011\n\nThe Washington Post, Running in the red: How the U.S., on the road to surplus, detoured to massive debt, April 30, 2011\n\nBloomberg, U.S. Deficit for 2009 Totals $1.4 Trillion, Budget Office Says, Oct. 8, 2009\n\nCongressional Budget Office, Monthly Budget Review, Fiscal Year 2009: A Congressional Budget Office Analysis, Oct. 7, 2009", "Congressional Budget Office, The Budget and Economic Outlook: Fiscal Years 2010 to 2020, January 2010\n\nCongressional Budget Office, The Budget and Economic Outlook: An Update, August 2009\n\nCongressional Budget Office, Monthly Budget Review, Fiscal Year 2010: A Congressional Budget Office Analysis, Oct. 7, 2010\n\nEmail interview with Chapin Fay, a spokesman for state Sen.
