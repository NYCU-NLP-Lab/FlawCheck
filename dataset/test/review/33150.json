["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "George P. Bush, the first-year Texas land commissioner, maintains that most students are stuck in bad schools.", "Bush, addressing a \"school choice\" rally outside the Texas Capitol Jan. 30, 2015, said: \"I believe that most teachers are doing the very best in very difficult situations when a majority of our students are trapped in schools that are underperforming. Some schools don\u2019t work and refuse to change \u2014 and that\u2019s why we need school choice and that\u2019s why we need it now.\"", "The Rev. Charles Johnson, executive director of Pastors for Texas Children, which describes itself as an independent ministry and outreach group supporting quality public education opportunities for Texas children, asked us to check Bush\u2019s statement, which Johnson said he heard about from someone who watched the rally.", "We were curious too.", "Asked where Bush\u2019s data came from, Brittany Eck, a General Land Office spokeswoman, pointed out a comment by the state\u2019s chief education official in October 2013, when Texas received a waiver from the federal Adequate Yearly Progress requirement that more than 90 percent of students in each school and district pass the state\u2019s standardized tests in reading and math, in accord with the No Child Left Behind Act that passed into law when George W. Bush was president.", "At the time Texas got its waiver, Eck said by email, the state\u2019s education commissioner, Michael Williams, said 95 percent of the state\u2019s school districts would not have met the federal law\u2019s expectations, according to an October 2013 news story in the Dallas Morning News. Eck noted the same judgment was aired by a non-governmental group, the Texas Classroom Teachers Association.", "Meantime, Eck wrote, only 28 percent to 41 percent of Texas fourth- and eighth-graders chosen to take the National Assessment of Educational Progress, sometimes called the nation\u2019s report card, met \"proficiency\" levels in math or reading in 2013. Some perspective: According to the 2013 results, 62 percent to 84 percent of the Texas students scored well enough to meet basic expectations or better.", "State accountability ratings", "Next, we asked the Texas Education Agency what it considers the best measurement of schools in Texas. Spokeswoman Debbie Ratcliffe said by email the state\u2019s own accountability system is the only rating system in place. And according to the latest state summary of the ratings, released in December 2014, 949 of the state\u2019s 1,025 school districts, 93 percent, \"met standard\" while 76 districts were rated \"improvement required.\"", "The summary said 6,723, or 86 percent, of the state\u2019s individual schools \"met standard\" with 142 meeting an alternate standard \u2014 leaving 636 campuses rated \"improvement required,\" meaning the campus missed the state\u2019s standard on one or more performance indicators, according to the TEA. Those indicators include student results on the State of Texas Assessment of Academic Readiness (STAAR) and graduation and annual dropout rates, according to the TEA\u2019s Accountability Manual.", "For 2014, the summary said, some 484 campuses weren\u2019t rated and one school had \"data integrity issues.\" (We did not consider charter schools to carve out these counts; there aren\u2019t a lot of them.)", "Overall in the year, Ratcliffe said, 372,287 of the state\u2019s 5,151,925 public-school students, 7 percent, were enrolled in schools that received the \"improvement required\" rating.", "Ratcliffe did not dispute that Williams had said 95 percent of the state\u2019s districts would not have cleared the AYP hurdles. The waived expectation under the federal law was that more than 90 percent of students in each school and district pass the state\u2019s standardized tests in reading and math.", "\"We do fall short of perfection,\" Ratcliffe said.", "Texas Classroom Teachers Association", "Given that Eck singled out the classroom teachers association, we asked that group, which advocates for teachers, to assess Bush\u2019s statement.", "By email, Holly Eaton focused on doubts about the usefulness of the AYP standards, which she said have long been regarded as not attainable at the law\u2019s stipulated pace, explaining why many states (more than 40, the News story said) got waivers, she said. \"Accordingly, the projection that 95% of Texas schools would have failed to meet AYP in 2014 shows that Texas was in the same predicament as every other state in the country due to a poorly conceived and widely discredited federal standard,\" Eaton said. By phone, she elaborated: \"We don\u2019t think the federal AYP ratings are of any significance.\"", "Broadly, Eaton said, the association disagrees with Bush\u2019s characterization.", "Other perspectives", "We also reached out to other close observers of Texas schools.", "Lori Taylor, a Texas A&M University associate professor in the Bush School of Government and Public Service, commented by email: \"I think the term \u2018underperforming\u2019 is really squishy. If one has exceedingly high standards for education, then every school is always underperforming.\"", "Taylor pointed out the state\u2019s 2014 accountability ratings \u2014 and called AYP an \"odd standard of performance\" because of the law\u2019s everyone-must-pass requirement for a school to be considered acceptable. \"Most researchers are highly critical of AYP as a measure of performance, so schools that are performing badly by this measure are not necessarily underperforming as most folks understand the term,\" Taylor wrote.", "Also by email, Torey Tipton of Children at Risk, which analyzes test results and other indicators in its own way, said many Texas children are in failing schools. In spring 2014, she said, 2,275, or 30 percent, of more than 7,000 schools ranked by the group landed Children at Risk grades of D, needing \"significant improvement,\" or F, which the group defines as \"highly concerning.\"", "Our ruling", "Bush said the \"majority of our students are trapped in\" underperforming schools.", "Bush relied on another official\u2019s speculation about how well schools might meet disputed federal standards that don\u2019t apply to Texas this year anyway. Meantime, 2014 state ratings indicate more than nine in 10 districts fulfilled state-set standards and more than eight in 10 campuses did so.", "We rate this claim False.", "FALSE \u2013 The statement is not accurate.", "Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "Web page, \"NAEP, Texas results, 2013,\" U.S. Department of Education (accessed March 6, 2015)", "Press release, \"Final 2014 accountability ratings released,\" Texas Education Agency, Dec. 3, 2014", "News story, \"U.S. grants Texas a waiver on No Child Left Behind rules,\" the Dallas Morning News, Oct. 1, 2013", "Emails, Holly Eaton, director of Professional Development and Advocacy, Texas Classroom Teachers Association, March 5, 2015", "Emails, Debbie Ratcliffe, director of media relations, Texas Education Agency, March 4 and 6, 2015", "Publication, \"2014 Accountability Manual,\" Texas Education Agency, chapters posted online in May and June 2014 (accessed March 6, 2015)", "Email, Lori Taylor, associate professor, Bush School of Government and Public Service, Texas A&M University, March 6, 2015", "Emails, Torey Tipton, assistant director of the center for Social Measurement and Evaluation, Children at Risk, March 6, 2015", "Web pages, \"School Rankings, 2014,\" spring 2014; \"Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs),\" Children at Risk, undated (accessed March 6, 2015)", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
