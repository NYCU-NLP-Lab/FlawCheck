Based on online hits, it became one of our most popular fact-checks ever.", "So we wondered about the Walmart claim.", "Wealth, not income", "In the days before and after Black Friday, leaders no less prominent than President Barack Obama and Pope Francis decried the extent of income disparity in the United States and around the world. Obama called the growing income gap a \"defining challenge of our time.\" The pope said that while the earnings of a minority \"are growing exponentially, so, too, is the gap separating the majority from the prosperity enjoyed by those happy few.\"", "Walmart, of course, is a big target.", "According to Forbes, as of May 2013 the international retailer had $469 billion in sales and 2.2 million employees, including 1.3 million in the United States.

So, things like savings and retirement accounts, minus what is owed on a home mortgage, credit cards, etc. That means a person with heavy debt can have little wealth, or negative wealth, even while earning a six-figure income.", "One more point before we get to the wealth figures.", "Walmart was founded by the late Sam Walton, who opened the first store in Arkansas in 1962. Walmart incorporated in 1969 and became a publicly traded company a year later. So, Wal-Mart is not family owned, but rather owned by its stockholders; on the other hand, according to Bloomberg and other news reports, the Walton family members still have control of the company, owning about half of the shares.", "Group's evidence", "Scot Ross, One Wisconsin Now's executive director, told us his evidence to back his group\u2019s claim is a July 2012 article by economist Josh Bivens, research and policy director of the liberal Economics Policy Institute in Washington, D.C.", "Bivens wrote that in 2010, the wealth of six Walton family heirs was $89.5 billion, 22 percent higher than in 2007.", "Meanwhile, the median wealth of American families in 2010 was $77,300, nearly 39 percent lower than three years earlier.", "(Median wealth refers to the American family that is exactly wealthier than half of all families and less wealthy than half.)", "As for measuring one against the other, Bivens said the Walton family wealth in 2010 was as large as the wealth of the bottom 48.8 million families in the United States, or 41.5 percent of all American families.", "Rounded up, 41.5 percent would be 42 percent, the figure One Wisconsin Now claims.", "But let's keep shopping around a little.", "Similar claim", "It turns out that a statement nearly identical to the one made by One Wisconsin Now was uttered in July 2012 by U.S. Sen.
