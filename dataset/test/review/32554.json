["By Eugene Kiely", "Posted on February 8, 2019", "A \u201cfact-check\u201d video posted on Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 official social media accounts misrepresents employment data in an attempt to prove President Donald Trump \u201cwrong\u201d about the economy. The data actually show employment continues to improve under Trump.", "The video, which appeared on Sanders\u2019 official Twitter and Facebook accounts, received more than 600,000 combined views. It features Warren Gunnels, the senator\u2019s top aide on the Senate budget committee, \u201cfact-checking\u201d the president\u2019s State of the Union address.", "Gunnels covers a lot of ground \u2014 but we\u2019re going to focus here on his claims involving the unemployment rate for the general population and employment data for those ages 25 to 54.", "In his State of the Union address, Trump said \u201cunemployment has reached the lowest rate in over half a century.\u201d The official unemployment rate, which was 4 percent in January, dropped as low as 3.7 percent in September and November \u2014 marking the first time it had been that low since 1969.", "In the \u201cfact-check\u201d video, Gunnels mocks the president and takes issue with Trump\u2019s use of the official unemployment rate \u2014 which, as a candidate, Trump regularly dismissed as a \u201cjoke.\u201d", "\u201cThe reality is that the real unemployment rate \u2014 which includes those who have given up looking for work and those who are working part time when they need a full-time job \u2014 is 8.1 percent, not 4 percent,\u201d Gunnels says.", "The official unemployment rate represents people who are out of work and actively seeking work in the last four weeks.", "Gunnels, instead, is referring to the U-6, an \u201calternative measure of labor underutilization,\u201d which includes the total unemployed, discouraged workers who have stopped looking for work, and part-time workers who cannot find full-time work for economic reasons.", "Gunnels is right that the U-6 rate was 8.1 percent in January. But this is what he doesn\u2019t tell his viewers: Under Trump,\u00a0the U-6 rate had dropped to its lowest level in 17 years.", "When Trump took office, the U-6 rate was 9.3 percent. Since then, it dropped nearly 2 percentage points to a low of 7.4 percent in August 2018. It hadn\u2019t been that low since April 2001.", "Even the current rate of 8.1 percent is 1.2 percentage points lower than it was when Trump took office and much lower than the monthly average of 10.4 percent since 1994, which is when BLS started to publish this and other alternative measures of labor underutilization.", "The below chart, based on BLS data, shows how using one data point without any context \u2014 as Gunnels did in his \u201cfact-check\u201d video \u2014 is misleading.", "In the video, Gunnels moves directly from the \u201creal\u201d unemployment rate to the number of people working \u2014 or rather not working.", "\u201cAnd over 20 percent of Americans between the ages of 25-54 do not have a job, which is higher than was the case 19 years ago,\u201d he says.", "This time Gunnels is cherry-picking data to make a partisan attack.", "In an email, Gunnels told us: \u201cAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Employment Population Ratio for those between the ages of 25-54 was 79.9 percent in January of 2019 and 81.1 percent in January of 2000.\u201d\u00a0The\u00a0employment-population ratio\u00a0is the percentage of the population that is employed \u2013 and, in this case, for workers between the ages of 25 and 54.", "If 79.9 percent of the 25-to-54 population was working in January, then 20.1 percent was not working. So Gunnels is right about that.", "But, again, the Sanders \u201cfact-check\u201d video doesn\u2019t tell viewers all of the pertinent facts.", "It omits these facts about the latest employment-population ratio:", "Instead, Gunnels cherry-picks January 2000 as his basis of comparison to make it appear that the trend is down, when, in fact, it is up. (Quick aside: The ratio was actually 81.8 percent in January 2000, not 81.1 percent as Gunnels said in his email to us.)", "Here is a chart that puts the employment-population ratio for January 2019 into context, dating back to 1948:", "Gunnels takes the position that Trump was \u201cwrong\u201d when the president said the U.S. has \u201cthe hottest economy anywhere in the world.\u201d That\u2019s his opinion.", "But he cannot misrepresent the facts \u2014 especially in a \u201cfact-check\u201d video.\u00a0Yes, the labor figures he uses are accurate, but they leave a skewed impression of the economy under Trump without context.", "Instead, we invite readers to view our fact-check video of the president\u2019s State of the Union address.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
