["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on September 17, 2020 | Updated on June 29, 2021", "A paper that has not been peer-reviewed reaches faulty conclusions to advance the unsubstantiated claim that the novel coronavirus was bioengineered in a Chinese lab, according to immunology and microbiology experts. The paper\u2019s claims were amplified by Fox News, anyway.", "A long-circulating, unsubstantiated claim about the origins of the novel coronavirus resurfaced in recent days after a paper published online purported that SARS-CoV-2 was created in a lab.", "The baseless claim \u2014 which we first addressed in the early days of the pandemic \u2014 was further amplified when Fox News host Tucker Carlson featured an interview with one of the authors of the paper on his show on Sept. 15.", "That segment was viewed on YouTube nearly 2 million times and that link alone was shared by more nearly 50,000 users on Facebook, according to CrowdTangle analytics data, where other popular posts also repeated the allegations.", "But experts say the new paper, which has not been peer-reviewed, does not prove that the virus was created in a lab.", "The paper was uploaded to an open-access website Sept. 14 and was published by the \u201cRule of Law Society & Rule of Law Foundation\u201d \u2014 two related entities in New York tied to Steve Bannon, a former adviser to President Donald Trump. Bannon is listed as the chair of the Rule of Law Society in a registration document filed last year with the state.", "The organizations are connected to a partnership forged by Bannon and Guo Wengui, an exiled Chinese businessman, that has been described as being based on their shared disdain for the Chinese government. Guo is wanted in China on charges of bribery and fraud \u2014 allegations he has denied \u2014 according to the New York Times. Bannon announced in November 2018 that Guo would be setting up a $100 million \u201cRule of Law fund\u201d in part to aid Chinese dissidents and their families.", "Guo\u2019s work in the U.S., including consulting services from Bannon, has drawn the interest of federal investigators, the Wall Street Journal has reported.", "The new paper attempts to make the case that the novel coronavirus couldn\u2019t have come from nature and instead may have been created by altering a previously discovered bat coronavirus. But several of its main points rest on faulty conclusions.", "One of the study\u2019s main claims is that the \u201cgenomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 is suspiciously similar to that of a bat coronavirus discovered by military laboratories\u201d in China and therefore indicates that another coronavirus was used to create the novel coronavirus.", "Kristian G. Andersen, a professor of immunology and microbiology at Scripps Research who has studied the origins of the virus, said of the claim on Twitter: \u201cThis simply can\u2019t be true \u2013 there are more than 3,500 nucleotide differences between SARS-CoV-2 and these viruses.\u201d", "And Dr. Stanley Perlman, a professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Iowa who studies coronaviruses, told us in an email that the coronavirus referenced \u2014 ZC45 \u2014 is \u201conly 89% related to SARS-CoV-2. In virology terms, that is very distant.\u201d", "Perlman said it would be nearly impossible to make the reverse genetics system needed to manipulate the virus and \u201cchanging its sequence to arrive at SARS-CoV-2 would be virtually impossible since it would not be known how to manipulate the virus.\u201d", "Nevertheless, Dr. Li-Meng Yan \u2014 one of the authors of the new paper and a virologist who has claimed she fled China to reveal the truth about COVID-19 \u2014 doubled down on Carlson\u2019s show. She alleged a cover-up by the Chinese government and the scientific community.", "Yan, Sept. 15: This virus, COVID-19 SARS-CoV-2 virus, actually is not from nature. It is a man-made virus created in the lab based on the China military discovered and owned the very unique bat coronavirus, which cannot affect people, but after the modification become a very harmful virus at now. So, I have evidence to show why they can do it, what they have done, how did they do it.", "The paper goes on to suggest that \u201cSARS-CoV-2 contains a unique furin-cleavage site in its Spike protein\u201d \u2014 which is \u201ccompletely absent in this particular class of coronaviruses found in nature\u201d \u2014 and that, therefore, the virus was engineered.", "Susan R. Weiss, a University of Pennsylvania professor of microbiology who researches coronaviruses, told us in an email that that \u201cmakes no sense in terms of what we know about\u201d coronaviruses.", "\u201cAmong murine coronavirus strains there are viruses with the furin site and strains without \u2014 closely related strains closer than SARS-1 and SARS-2 yet they are all virulent,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cSo this observation says nothing to me about the virus being engineered.\u201d", "A furin site is a short protein sequence that can be recognized and cut by other proteins.", "Perlman also said \u201cfurin sites are found in many coronaviruses and finding it does not surprise us in the field.\u201d", "The paper also argues a conspiracy is afoot by claiming that scientific journals won\u2019t publish the \u201calternative theory that the virus may have come from a research laboratory.\u201d", "\u201cI don\u2019t believe that,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cIt is just that the data is not compelling. I don\u2019t know any CoV researchers that believe this at all. There is no way anyone could figure out how to make a virus behave like SARS-2 \u2013 asymptomatic spread for [one] thing.\u201d", "In March, Andersen and other scientists concluded in an\u00a0article in Nature Medicine that the novel coronavirus \u201cis not a laboratory construct or a purposefully manipulated virus.\u201d The authors said that the virus likely originated in one of two ways: \u201cnatural selection in an animal host before zoonotic transfer,\u201d meaning before the spread of disease from animals to humans, or \u201cnatural selection in humans following zoonotic transfer.\u201d", "The Nature Medicine\u00a0article did say it couldn\u2019t rule out an accidental laboratory release of the naturally occurring virus, but its authors said they \u201cdo not believe that any type of laboratory-based scenario is plausible.\u201d", "The new, dubious paper attempts to discredit those findings by saying the Nature Medicine study\u2019s authors \u201cshow signs of conflict of interests, raising further concerns on the credibility of this publication.\u201d", "The supposed support for that allegation:\u00a0that one of the authors, Columbia University\u2019s Dr. W. Ian Lipkin, received an award from China for his work on public health there following the 2003 outbreak of the coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS.", "The new paper also references the curriculum vitae of another author \u2014 Edward C. Holmes, a researcher at the University of Sydney in Australia \u2014 which shows that he has collaborated with scientists and organizations in China.", "\u201c[D]espite the online lies and malicious editing of my Wikipedia page, I have never received any funds from China, personal or research, and have no grants with Chinese scientists. I do have some honorary appointments there and a nice certificate though,\u201d Holmes wrote on Twitter. \u201cI do work closely with some Chinese scientists and as that directly led to the first release of the genome sequence that might just perhaps possibly be argued to be a good thing.\u201d", "Andersen also said that the allegation about the authors being \u201cconflicted\u201d was wrong. \u201c[M]y lab has never received funding from China and we have no collaborations with Chinese investigators. I have no financial interests in China,\u201d he said in a tweet. \u201cAll our analyses are scientific and unbiased.\u201d", "It\u2019s worth noting that collaborations between researchers in the U.S. and China aren\u2019t uncommon. A recent study published in Higher Education found that U.S. research output between 2014 and 2018 would have dropped without Chinese partnerships \u2014 while China\u2019s output would have grown regardless of work with the U.S. \u201c[T]he findings demonstrate that the USA has more to lose than gain in cutting ties with China,\u201d its authors wrote.", "Public health officials have also suggested the virus originated in bats.", "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said: \u201cThe SARS-CoV-2 virus is a betacoronavirus, like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. All three of these viruses have their origins in bats. The sequences from U.S. patients are similar to the one that China initially posted, suggesting a likely single, recent emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir. However, the exact source of this virus is unknown.\u201d", "And in April, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said in a statement that the \u201cIntelligence Community also concurs with the wide scientific consensus that the COVID-19 virus was not manmade or genetically modified.\u201d The intelligence community, it said, \u201cwill continue to rigorously examine emerging information and intelligence to determine whether the outbreak began through contact with infected animals or if it was the result of an accident at a laboratory in Wuhan.\u201d", "Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told National Geographic\u00a0in a May interview, \u201cIf you look at the evolution of the virus in bats and what\u2019s out there now, [the scientific evidence] is very, very strongly leaning toward this could not have been artificially or deliberately manipulated.\u201d", "\u201cEverything about the stepwise evolution over time strongly indicates that [this virus] evolved in nature and then jumped species,\u201d Fauci said.", "Jessica McDonald contributed to this article.", "Update, Sept. 28: Experts have since published more thorough reviews of Yan\u2019s paper. Researchers at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security concluded that the paper \u201cpresents a theory about the origin of SARS-CoV-2 but offers contradictory and inaccurate information that does not support their argument.\u201d", "And in a review published by the MIT Press\u2019 \u201cRapid Reviews COVID-19,\u201d researchers from IBM and the University of Michigan\u00a0found that the paper \u201cdoes not demonstrate sufficient scientific evidence to support its claims\u201d and that its \u201c[c]laims are at times baseless and are not supported by the data and methods used.\u201d", "Update, May 21, 2021: The exact origin of the coronavirus remains unknown. On May 14 the journal Science published a letter from 18 scientists calling for \u201cmore investigation\u201d to determine how the pandemic began. \u201cTheories of accidental release from a lab and zoonotic spillover both remain viable,\u201d they wrote. \u201cKnowing how COVID-19 emerged is critical for informing global strategies to mitigate the risk of future outbreaks.\u201d", "Update, June 29, 2021: Please see our June 25 story \u201cThe Facts \u2013 and Gaps \u2013 on the Origin of the Coronavirus\u201d for a detailed examination of the debate over the origin of the pandemic.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
