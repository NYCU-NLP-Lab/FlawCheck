["By Eugene Kiely, Robert Farley and Lori Robertson", "Posted on July 3, 2019", "In recent days, contradictory claims have been made about border issues, including the living conditions for migrants being housed at U.S. Customs and Border Protection detention facilities:", "For months, there has been a rising number of migrants, many of them from Central America, attempting to cross the U.S.-Mexico border. In May, there were more than 132,000 people apprehended illegally trying to cross the border \u2014 the highest number since March 2006. On July 1, President Donald Trump signed a $4.6 billion emergency aid bill to help CBP cope with the surge of immigrants.", "On June 28, a day after the House gave final approval, acting\u00a0Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan held a press conference to praise Congress for providing the emergency funding, but also urged it to address the root cause of the problem.", "At the press conference, McAleenan also criticized media accounts of the living conditions at the agency\u2019s detention facilities that are temporarily housing migrants at the border. In doing so, he made at least two statements that have proven to be false.", "After saying that the Department of Homeland Security has provided \u201cunprecedented resources\u201d to deal with the surge of migrants at the border, McAleenan said this about the living conditions at the detention centers:", "McAleenan, June 28: Contrary to the reporting, children in CBP custody at the border are receiving access to key supplies, including toothbrushes, appropriate meals, blankets, showers as soon as they can be provided and medical screening.", "Four days later, the DHS Office of Inspector General issued a report\u00a0on the \u201cdangerous overcrowding\u201d conditions at Border Patrol facilities that directly contradicted McAleenan\u2019s claims about meals and showers.", "The IG report said it visited five Border Patrol facilities in the Rio Grande Valley Sector in Texas, including border stations in\u00a0McAllen,\u00a0Weslaco\u00a0and Brownsville, and two processing centers. The IG found that the agency is violating its own standards for care.", "\u201cDuring our visits to five Border Patrol facilities and two ports of entry in the Rio Grande Valley, we reviewed compliance with CBP\u2019s Transport, Escort, Detention and Search (TEDS) standards, which govern CBP\u2019s interaction with detained individuals, and observed serious overcrowding and prolonged detention of unaccompanied alien children (UACs), families, and single adults that require immediate attention,\u201d the report said.", "Contrary to McAleenan\u2019s claim that migrant children are receiving \u201cappropriate meals,\u201d the IG report said: \u201cWhile all facilities had infant formula, diapers, baby wipes, and juice and snacks for children, we observed that two facilities had not provided children access to hot meals \u2014 as is required by the TEDS standards \u2014 until the week we arrived.\u00a0Instead, the children were fed sandwiches and snacks for their meals.\u201d", "Further, the report said that \u201cmany single adults had been receiving only bologna sandwiches. Some detainees on this diet were becoming constipated and required medical attention.\u201d", "As for McAleenan\u2019s claim that children had access to \u201cshowers as soon as they can be provided,\u201d the IG report found violations of the agency\u2019s own standards.", "\u201cFor example, children at three of the five Border Patrol facilities we visited had no access to showers, despite the TEDS standards requiring that \u2018reasonable efforts\u2019 be made to provide showers to children approaching 48 hours in detention,\u201d the report said. \u201cAt these facilities, children had limited access to a change of clothes; Border Patrol had few spare clothes and no laundry facilities.\u201d", "The sanitary conditions were even worse for adults \u2014 including some who hadn\u2019t had access to a shower for as long as a month.", "IG Report, July 2:\u00a0In these overcrowded conditions, CBP was unable to meet TEDS standards. For example, although TEDS standards require CBP to make a reasonable effort to provide a shower for adults after 72 hours, most single adults had not had a shower in CBP custody despite several being held for as long as a month. At some facilities, Border Patrol was giving detainees wet-wipes to maintain personal hygiene. Most single adult detainees were wearing the clothes they arrived in days, weeks, and even up to a month prior.", "The report said one senior manager described the situation as a \u201cticking time bomb.\u201d", "In one heated Twitter exchange, White House adviser Kellyanne Conway accused Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of being \u201call talk, no dollars\u201d because she voted \u201cAGAINST the $4.6 billion bipartisan humanitarian aid that is FOR THEM\u201d and \u201ceven voted against the Democratic aid package.\u201d", "Ocasio-Cortez shot back: \u201cThe $4.6 billion wasn\u2019t humanitarian at all. It had NO accountability measures for facilities that abuse children and families. It didn\u2019t fix the problem, just funded abuse. I don\u2019t believe in billion dollar blank checks for unethical, abusive administrations. Including yours.\u201d", "We take no position on whether the bill provides enough accountability measures, but it does include money for food, shelter and medical expenses and other aid that would be considered humanitarian for migrants and unaccompanied children.", "How many migrant women did @AOC help by voting AGAINST the $4.6 billion bipartisan humanitarian aid that is FOR THEM?", "(She even voted against the Democrat aid package).", "All talk, no dollars. https://t.co/kwNEFwSFNR", "\u2014 Kellyanne Conway (@KellyannePolls) July 2, 2019", "The $4.6 billion wasn\u2019t humanitarian at all.

Ocasio-Cortez was one of just four Democrats who opposed the bill (which was also opposed by the vast majority of Republicans).", "A joint statement released on June 22 by the four Democrats who opposed the $4.5 billion aid package explained that their opposition was tied to the bill including $1.2 billion to Customs and Border Protection and $128 million to Immigration and Customs Enforcement.", "\u201cThese radicalized, criminal agencies are destroying families and killing innocent children,\u201d the statement said. \u201cIt is absolutely unconscionable to even consider giving one more dollar to support this President\u2019s deportation force that openly commits human rights abuses and refuses to be held accountable to the American people. That is why in good conscience, we cannot support this supplemental funding bill, which gives even more money to ICE and CBP and continues to support a fundamentally cruel and broken immigration system.\u201d The statement called for the abolishment of ICE and an \u201cend [to] the system of mass detention and deportation of immigrants.\u201d", "\u201cI will not fund another dime to allow ICE to continue its manipulative tactics,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said, according to the New York Times.", "The Senate passed its own version of a $4.6 billion emergency aid package in largely bipartisan fashion. House Democrats initially balked at the Senate version, raising concerns about accountability and transparency, among other things. But with Congress set to go on a Fourth of July break and  the administration\u00a0warning that it would run out of money within days, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi relented, sending a letter to her Democratic caucus urging them to support the Senate version of the bill \u201cto make sure that the resources needed to protect the children are available.\u201d", "Pelosi, June 28: The children come first. At the end of the day, we have to make sure that the resources needed to protect the children are available. Therefore, we will not engage in the same disrespectful behavior that the Senate did in ignoring our priorities. In order to get resources to the children fastest, we will reluctantly pass the Senate bill. As we pass the Senate bill, we will do so with a Battle Cry as to how we go forward to protect children in a way that truly honors their dignity and worth.", "The bill passed the House, 305-102, with Ocasio-Cortez joining 95 other Democrats and seven Republicans in opposition.", "\u201cHis [Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s] Senate bill is a militarization bill. McConnell killed the House Bill & dropped this one right before recess to force passage,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said on Twitter. \u201cWell, too bad. This is our job. Cancel vacation, fly the Senate in. Pass a clean humanitarian bill & stop trying to squeeze crises for more pain.\u201d", "\u201cThis Senate Bill will have us write a $4.6 Billion blank check (incl military $) for the border w NO accountability \u2013 just a verbal pinky promise,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez tweeted the same day. \u201cTrump is not to be trusted with protecting our immigrants\u201d", "The lawmaker may take issue with the Senate bill not being a \u201cclean\u00a0humanitarian bill,\u201d but she\u2019s not correct that it \u201cwasn\u2019t humanitarian at all.\u201d The largest portion of the funding \u2014 $2.88 billion \u2014 will go to Health and Human Services to provide shelter and care for unaccompanied children. At least $866 million of that will go toward providing \u201ccare in licensed shelters and for expanding the supply of shelters.\u201d", "Ocasio-Cortez is correct that it includes money for the military \u2014 $145 million \u201cto respond to the significant rise in unaccompanied minors and family unit aliens at the southwest border and related activities.\u201d", "The bill also includes $220 million for the Department of Justice, including $65 million to fund 30 new immigration judge teams and $155 million for the U.S. Marshals Service for housing, transportation and care for federal detainees.", "Other funding includes $1 billion for CBP, including $708 million for the operation of migrant care facilities and $112 million for \u201cconsumables and medical care\u201d for migrants. Another $209 million would go to ICE, including $85 million for \u201cprocurement, construction, and improvements for migrant care facilities.\u201d", "Were detainees in border patrol facilities told by guards to drink water from toilets? That\u2019s what at least four Democratic lawmakers claimed, though it\u2019s unclear whether the reference to toilets was to a sink/toilet combination unit and the tap water from the sink part.", "From a fact-checking perspective, this claim is akin to hearsay in court. We can\u2019t say what unidentified guards told unidentified detainees or what those detainees then told lawmakers. But we can lay out what we do know.", "On July 1, a group of Democratic lawmakers visited CBP detention facilities in Texas. Afterward, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York\u00a0said on Twitter: \u201cOfficers were keeping women in cells w/ no water & had told them to drink out of the toilets.\u201d", "Two lawmakers from Texas also made that claim. Rep. Joaquin Castro told reporters:\u00a0\u201cWhen we went into the cell, it was \u2014 it was clear that the water was not running. There was a toilet but there was no running water for people to drink. In fact, one of the women said that she was told by an agent to drink water out of the toilet.\u201d And\u00a0Rep. Marc Veasey said in a July 2 interview on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cHardball\u201c: \u201cWell, what we saw was horrible, particularly when we talked with some of the detainees that were in the holding cells at the first facility that we visited. Where we were told that they were \u2014 if they asked for a drink of water, that the guards told them to drink out of the toilet.\u201d", "Rep. Judy Chu of California also tweeted: \u201c\u2018If you want water, just drink from a toilet.\u2019 That\u2019s what border patrol told one thirsty woman we met on today\u2019s #DemsAtTheBorder trip.\u201d", "David Martosko, the U.S. political editor with the Daily Mail, questioned on Twitter whether the toilets had sinks with faucets on top of them, as he showed in a picture from a different facility:", "I haven't seen photo of the Clint, TX facilities that @AOC described today, but it would be interesting if \"drinking from the toilet\" meant drinking from an attached sink marked \"potable water\" \u2014 like this image from a CBP holding facility in Tuscon (filed in federal court). pic.twitter.com/uDbhy1GPOa", "\u2014 David Martosko (@dmartosko) July 1, 2019", "Ocasio-Cortez responded to that tweet, saying it was indeed a toilet like that but the sink portion wasn\u2019t working.", "\u201cThis was in fact the type of toilet we saw in the cell. Except there was just one, and the sink portion was not functioning \u2013 @AyannaPressley smartly tried to open the faucet, and nothing came out,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said, referring to Rep. Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts. \u201cSo the women were told they could drink out of the bowl.\u201d", "Clara Long, the deputy Washington director of Human Rights Watch, also told MSNBC: \u201cAsking people to drink out of that tap that comes out of the toilet is common practice across the entire border.\u201d Host Chris Matthews asked: \u201cBut it didn\u2019t mean go drinking out of the toilet bowl?\u201d Long responded: \u201cIt\u2019s not drinking out of the toilet bowl.\u201d", "Customs and Border Protection issued a statement that said: \u201cRepresentatives visited two locations (El Paso Station and Clint Station), where migrants in custody receive three meals a day and have access to clean drinking water. \u2026\u00a0CBP takes allegations of mistreatment of individuals in our facilities seriously, and reports all allegations to both the DHS Office of the Inspector General and the CBP Office of Professional Responsibility. Any employee found to have violated our standards of conduct will be held accountable.\u201d", "BuzzFeed News noted that there have been complaints about detainees being told to drink from toilet tanks before. A 2014 complaint\u00a0filed by immigrant legal groups on behalf of 116 children held in custody said: \u201cMore than 80 percent described denial of adequate food and water in CBP custody, including a child whose only available drinking water came from a toilet tank and others who received only frozen or spoiled food and subsequently became ill.\u201d", "On MSNBC\u2019s \u201cHardball,\u201d Veasey also made the unsubstantiated claimed that \u201cabout half\u201d of the Border Patrol agents were members of a secret Facebook group page that included vulgar and sexists posts, as uncovered by ProPublica. The group says it is open to both current and former CBP agents, but Veasey assumes all are current agents.", "Veasey, July 2, MSNBC:\u00a0And you worry about your safety particularly when the people entrusted to guard you are probably members of that page. Like it was just mentioned about half of the members of Customs and Border Patrol are members of this Facebook page.", "Ocasio-Cortez echoed that claim on Twitter, saying: \u201cThere are 20,000 TOTAL Customs & Border Patrol agents in the US. 9,500 \u2013 almost HALF that number \u2013 are in a racist & sexually violent secret CBP Facebook group.\u201d", "But we don\u2019t know how many of the 9,500 Facebook page members are current versus former CBP agents, or how many may have become members of the page without having ever been agents.", "In a tweet, CBP said the group \u201cmay include a number of CBP employees.\u201d Matthew Klein, assistant commissioner in CBP\u2019s Office of Professional Responsibility, said in a statement that it had launched an investigation into the matter and notified the Department of Homeland Security Office of the Inspector General.", "We also don\u2019t know how many of the 9,500 Facebook group members have been involved in posting or commenting on the type of content ProPublica identified, which included posts targeting Ocasio-Cortez. Art Del Cueto, a Border Patrol union representative, told Fox News: \u201cI can tell you that it is a minimum amount of individuals that have been commenting in that rude way. Not that it makes a difference, right?\u201d He said \u201caround 20 individuals \u2026 are the ones that would be constantly putting something up.\u201d Del Cueto added: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to know who\u2019s an agent and who\u2019s not an agent,\u201d saying the union condemns the behavior.", "ProPublica reported that it had asked CBP about three agents it had identified \u201cwho appear to have participated in the online chats.\u201d", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
