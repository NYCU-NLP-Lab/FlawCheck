["About this rating", "In an August 2019 interview, Swift said she was \"pro-choice\" and reacted with dismay to proposals to tighten restrictions on abortion in Tennessee, saying \"I just can't believe this is happening.\"", "However, Swift did not specifically say \"I support abortion,\" nor did she say she couldn't believe \"people want to protect unborn children.\"", "In October 2019, we received multiple inquiries from readers about the accuracy of a report that claimed that the pop megastar Taylor Swift had said she \"supports abortion\" and finds it hard to believe \"people want to protect unborn children.\"", "The August 2019 article, by the pro-life website LifeNews, was shared widely after the website re-promoted it on its Facebook page. The headline proclaimed \"Taylor Swift: 'Obviously' I Support Abortion. 'Can't Believe' People Want to Protect Unborn Children.\" The article reported that:", "It\u2019s official. Pop sensation Taylor Swift supports abortion. It\u2019s no surprise that a member of Hollywood\u2019s elitist [sic] of the elite would put her stamp of approval on snuffing out the lives of unborn babies.", "But in a new interview with the Guardian published today, on the same day her new album was released, Taylor Swift endorsed abortion and trashed President Trump.", "When it comes to abortion, Swift said, \u201cObviously I\u2019m pro-choice.\u201d And when it comes to pro-life legislation in states across the country that would ban abortions and protect unborn children she said \u201cI just can\u2019t believe this is happening.\u201d", "LifeNews distorted Swift's exact words somewhat, but fundamentally gave an accurate description of her professed viewpoint on abortion, access to abortion, and legislative efforts to curtail that access in some U.S. states.", "In an interview with The Guardian, published on Aug. 24, Swift was asked about her views on politics, the 2016 election, and her sense of the state of society in the United States in 2019, as follows:", "As an ambitious 11-year-old, [Swift] worked out that singing the national anthem at sports games was the quickest way to get in front of a large audience. When did she start feeling conflicted about what America stands for? She gives another emphatic ugh. \u201cIt was the fact that all the dirtiest tricks in the book were used and it worked,\u201d she says. \u201cThe thing I can\u2019t get over right now is gaslighting the American public into being like\u201d \u2013 she adopts a sanctimonious tone \u2013 \u201c\u2018If you hate the president, you hate America.\u2019 We\u2019re a democracy \u2013 at least, we\u2019re supposed to be \u2013 where you\u2019re allowed to disagree, dissent, debate.\u201d She doesn\u2019t use Trump\u2019s name. \u201cI really think that he thinks this is an autocracy.\u201d", "As we speak, Tennessee lawmakers are trying to impose a near-total ban on abortion. Swift has staunchly defended her \u201cTennessee values\u201d in recent months. What\u2019s her position? \u201cI mean, obviously, I\u2019m pro-choice, and I just can\u2019t believe this is happening,\u201d she says. She looks close to tears. \u201cI can\u2019t believe we\u2019re here. It\u2019s really shocking and awful. And I just wanna do everything I can for 2020. I wanna figure out exactly how I can help, what are the most effective ways to help. \u2019Cause this is just\u2026\u201d She sighs again. \u201cThis is not it.\u201d [Emphasis added].", "Swift clearly stated \"I'm pro-choice,\" meaning she supports access to abortion rights, as a matter of principle. That's not quite the same as saying \"I support abortion,\" as LifeNews rather conspicuously insisted on claiming. Those who identify as \"pro-choice\" typically support affording women the option of choosing to terminate their pregnancy, rather than being enthusiastic or gleeful in any way about the actual procedure involved.", "Rephrasing what Swift actually said appears to have been a rhetorical ploy on the part of LifeNews, but the substantive effect of the reporting was that the reader would correctly understand that the singer supports abortion rights.", "Similarly, Swift did not actually say she couldn't believe \"people want to protect unborn children\" \u2014 that was, again, LifeNews' own characterization of laws passed by several state legislatures in 2018 and 2019, which would tightly restrict access to abortions.", "According to the Guardian interviewer's account, Swift appears to have been asked about the Tennessee Legislature's proposal to pass a bill that would almost totally ban abortion. Prompted in this way, she replied, \"I mean, obviously, I'm pro-choice, and I just can't believe this is happening.\"", "So, although LifeNews misled readers by attributing its own description of such abortion restrictions to Swift, the substantive effect on the reader was, once again, that they would correctly understand Swift to be opposed to such measures.", "Ertelt, Steven.\u00a0 \"Taylor Swift: 'Obviously' I Support Abortion.
