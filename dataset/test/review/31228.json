["The video, running at just over two minutes, was posted here on Facebook on January 18, 2021.", "\u201cThe cause of the second wave,\u201d reads the caption on the post, shared hundreds of times since it was published.", "The man in the video uses a carbon dioxide (CO\u2082) detection meter to argue that wearing masks is harmful.", "He does this by placing the meter behind the mask covering his mouth. On the meter\u2019s display panel, a reading that claims to measure CO\u2082 levels begins to rise, until it reaches\u00a0almost 10,000 parts per million (ppm).", "Levels of more than 5,000 ppm, according to a chart the man produces, could lead to severe side effects, including death.", "But, in July 2020, AFP Fact Check debunked a similar experiment, which experts dismissed as faulty science then, adding there are no serious health effects associated with masks.", "Experts explained that 5,000 ppm of CO\u2082 is the highest recommended exposure for people working eight-hour shifts every day, particularly in closed spaces.", "In fact, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and US-based Food Safety and Inspection Service advise that 40,000 ppm and higher is considered a dangerous level, even for short periods of time.", "Benjamin Neuman, an expert in coronaviruses who chairs the biological sciences department at Texas A&M University-Texarkana, said the demonstration in the video makes incorrect assumptions.", "In the experiment, a piece of equipment like the CO\u2082 meter will give a reading but the device cannot tell whether it is being used correctly or \u201cwhether there are flawed assumptions behind an experiment, as in this case,\u201d Neuman said in an email to AFP Fact Check.", "\u201cExhaled human breath is around 3.8 percent carbon dioxide, which would be 38,000 parts per million on the meter in the video, and of course comes out the nose and mouth.", "\u201cHe measures a maximum of around 1 percent carbon dioxide right after exhaling, which tells you right there that the mask is not doing a good job of retaining CO\u2082 since nearly three quarters escapes before it can be detected,\u201d said Neuman.", "Instead, a good control would have been to hold the machine at the same distance from the mouth without a mask and then measure the reading.", "\u201cWhen you are close to the part of a living thing where CO\u2082 comes out, you should expect to find some CO\u2082. With this test, he has demonstrated that he is alive, and nothing more.\u201d", "Neuman explained further: \u201cAn exhale is about half a litre of gas per breath. If masks were not permeable to gases, they would inflate and deflate like half-litre bubblegum balloons with each breath.\u201d", "So, the man in the video mistakenly presumes that the air he breathes in mainly comes from exhaled air, which is again not the case because the mask is permeable to gases.", "Neuman referred to research on the wearing of N95 masks which concluded that the amounts of oxygen and CO\u2082 entering the body are no different when wearing a mask.", "\u201cThe meter is designed to measure air in a closed room. If there is a buildup of carbon dioxide in the air that you inhale, that can certainly be bad over time, but that is not the case here.", "\u201cWhat changes when wearing a mask is not gas concentration but resistance: how hard it feels that your lungs have to work to pull in air,\u201d said Neuman.", "Even then, different masks have different resistance levels.", "According to Neuman, the body does a \u201cwonderful job\u201d of compensating for this and keeping gas levels in a relatively narrow range, for example when you\u2019re asleep or jogging.", "Neuman said if the man in the video was looking to publish his findings as evidence in a reputable scientific journal, it would be rejected with similar comments.", "\u201cThe person in the video is confusing what he feels with reality and doing a very flawed demonstration to make a point, rather than to understand the situation. It's far less interesting than a good magic trick, and no more real. This video is not what science is, or what it is for.\u201d", "Hyo-Jick Choi, a researcher at the University of Alberta, has designed surgical masks and respirator filters that deactivate certain viral strains and he believed the meter used in the demonstration \u201cmay provide more reliable values when measuring CO\u2082 in the atmosphere, as opposed to measuring CO\u2082 in a dynamic situation like CO\u2082 levels behind a mask during breathing\u201d.", "\u201cIf the experiments are correct, the carbon dioxide values should show an up (when exhaling) and down (when inhaling) trend over time, according to the respiration process,\u201d said Choi in an email to AFP Fact Check.", "However, in the video, the CO\u2082 values do not appear to decrease during inhalation, but continue to increase.", "\u201cThe device does not seem fit to monitor real-time carbon dioxide changes during the respiration process, which is supported by the continuous increase of the carbon dioxide values, as the video shows,\u201d wrote Choi.", "The man conducting the flawed experiment discourages people from wearing masks, suggesting they would be better off without them.", "Choi disagreed, calling it \u201ccompletely inaccurate information\u201d.", "\u201cIt is important to utilise the right tools, methods, and procedures to reach a solid conclusion,\u201d he added.", "False and misleading claims regarding the safety and efficacy of masks during the Covid-19 pandemic have been the subject of numerous debunks by AFP Fact Check (see here, here, and here).", "Unlike the caption on the post claims, the second wave of Covid-19 in South Africa was spurred by a new variant of the coronavirus first identified in the country. It was confirmed to be more contagious than earlier variants, and has accounted for higher hospital admissions, but there is no evidence that it is more deadly.", "The discovery of the new variant \u2013 known as 510Y.V2 \u2013 convinced local authorities to introduce new restrictions in December 2020 to slow its spread.", "The country has recorded almost 1.5 million detected infections and more than 44,000 fatalities since the pandemic began \u2013 the highest number of cases and deaths in Africa.", "#COVID19 Statistics in SA as at 02 February .\n\n\t\tUse the COVID Alert SA app to protect yourself, your loved ones and your community.
