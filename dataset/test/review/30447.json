["About this rating", "In March 2020, actor Tom Hanks was in Queensland, Australia, for the filming of a biopic about singer Elvis Presley, when he and his wife Rita Wilson went to a hospital \"after feeling run down\" and tested positive for COVID-19.", "Subsequently, a conspiracy meme shared on social media asserted that the actor had not been affected by COVID-19 at all, and claimed that report was a cover-up for Hanks' having been taken into custody for \"pedophilia,\" and fitted with an ankle bracelet to monitor his whereabouts:", "Obviously, if a person as globally prominent as Hanks had been arrested \u2014 especially on such a shocking charge \u2014 that fact would have been international news, so the total lack of any news reporting about it demonstrates it to be nothing more than a spurious and cruel rumor.", "Unfortunately, Hanks has been one of multiple celebrities \u2014 along with others such as Oprah Winfrey and Ellen DeGeneres \u2014 who have become the target of bizarre conspiracy theories about their alleged involvement in \"elite pedophile sex trafficking rings.\"", "The top two photographs in the meme, showing Hanks wearing a green T-shirt and green bandana, were taken in Los Angeles in May 2020. Obviously, Hanks couldn't have been in custody in Australia at that time. The bottom two photographs appear to show nothing more than the hem or cuff from his pant leg.", "Other photographs from the same time and place don't provide any convincing evidence of Hanks' having an ankle bracelet on one of his legs, either. It also makes no sense that Australian authorities have would arrested Hanks on a serious charge, placed him in custody, and deemed him a \"flight risk,\" then turned him loose to return to the U.S. a few weeks later with no precaution other than a monitoring bracelet.", "Photographs of Hanks taken more recently, in June and July 2020, captured the actor wearing shorts and sandals, and clearly showed he was not sporting an ankle bracelet.", "The Guardian. \u00a0 \"Tom Hanks Leaves Hospital After Coronavirus Diagnosis in Australia.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 17 March 2020.", "Palma, Bethania. \u00a0 \"The Roots of \u2018Pedophile Ring\u2019 Conspiracy Theories.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Snopes.com. \u00a0 2 September 2018.", "Farzan, Antonia Noori. \u00a0 \"\u2018NOT TRUE\u2019: Oprah Winfrey Debunks Bizarre QAnon Conspiracy Theory Spreading Across the Internet.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The Washington Post. \u00a0 18 March 2020.", "David Mikkelson founded the site now known as snopes.com back in 1994.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
