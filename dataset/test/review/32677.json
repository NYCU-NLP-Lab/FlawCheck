(Derek Gee/Buffalo News)", "Dutchess County Executive Marc Molinaro, a Republican running for governor, wants to cut state spending and reduce\u00a0taxes for New York state residents.", "That\u2019s something he\u2019s already done in his county, State Republican Chairman Edward F. Cox said.", "\"He has really done very well in each of the offices he\u2019s held, particularly as the county executive of Dutchess County, where he has cut taxes, his budget now is lower than it was six years ago,\" Cox said in a radio interview.", "Molinaro has been the top elected official in Dutchess County since 2012. He has been a vocal critic of Medicaid and unfunded mandates from the state that drive up local property taxes. He wants the state to shoulder more of the cost for those services. At the same time, he wants to cut state spending to keep state taxes low.", "Is Cox right that Molinaro has already cut spending and property taxes in Dutchess County?", "Property Taxes", "A spokesperson for Cox pointed to the county\u2019s approved budgets while Molinaro\u2019s been in office.", "This year\u2019s budget in Dutchess County reduced both the county property tax rate for residents and the tax levy for the fourth consecutive year, according to budget documents.", "But his first two budgets increased property taxes by about 2 percent in 2013 and again in 2014.", "The lower tax rates and levies don\u2019t mean property taxes have gone down for every resident in Dutchess County. Property tax bills are a combination of taxes levied by the county and each municipality. While the county\u2019s tax levy has gone down, some local taxes may have increased. Property taxes levied by\u00a0Poughkeepsie, for example, rose by 16.5 percent in 2017.", "Total spending", "Dutchess County spending, on the other hand, has gone up every year Molinaro has been in office.", "Total spending increased by about 6\u00a0percent between his first budget and\u00a02017, according to the county's budget office.\u00a0Total spending for 2018 won't be known until next year.", "Part of that is mandated spending by the state. Budget documents show the cost of mandated services has increased by close to $3 million since 2015.", "Cox\u2019s spokesperson said he was thinking about the county\u2019s workforce when he said total spending was down in Dutchess County. Molinaro has approved cuts in the county workforce since taking office. Budget documents show the county planned to\u00a0employ 1,753 full-time employees in 2018, down from 1,823 when Molinaro took office.", "Our ruling", "Cox said Molinaro has cut taxes and spending as Dutchess County Executive.", "He\u2019s right that county property taxes are lower. But spending has risen more than 6 percent since Molinaro's first budget.", "Cox\u2019s claim is partially accurate. On balance, we rate it Half True.", "EDITOR'S NOTE:\u00a0A previous version of this article used numbers from county budget documents to show changes in spending. Those numbers did not reflect the county's actual expenses, the county's budget office said.", "Ed Cox Interview on WCNY\u2019s The Capitol Pressroom, May 1, 2018", "Email conversation with Jessica Proud, spokesperson for Cox", "Email conversation and budget data obtained from the Dutchess County Budget Office", "Dutchess County 2013 Adopted Budget (Summary)", "Molinaro's 2013 Budget Message", "Dutchess County 2014 Adopted Budget", "Dutchess County 2018 Adopted Budget", "\"Poughkeepsie council fails to soften mayor's 16.5 percent tax increase,\" Poughkeepsie Journal, Dec. 20, 2016", "\"Dutchess County property tax rates rising in most towns,\" Daily Freeman, Dec. 24, 2013", "\"Dutchess ended 2016 with strong finances, $10 million surplus: Report,\" Poughkeepsie Journal, Oct. 6, 2017", "\"MAKING HIS MARC: Early in tenure as Dutchess County executive, Molinaro already having impact,\" Daily Freeman, May 13, 2012", "\"Dutchess County 2018 budget passes with bipartisan nod,\" Poughkeepsie Journal, Dec. 8, 2017", "Dutchess County FY 2015 Budget Highlights", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
