{"The claim of sending Christmas cards to": "a recovering American soldier\" at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center was debunked several years ago, indicating that it is not a new or valid program.", "The U": "S. Postal Service does not deliver letters, postcards, or packages addressed to \"Any Service Member\" or \"Any Soldier, Sailor, etc.\" This means that the claim of sending cards to unnamed service members is not accurate.", "The address provided in the Facebook post is the former location of the Walter Reed Army Medical Center": "which merged with the National Naval Medical Center in 2011. Therefore, sending cards to that address would not reach the intended recipients.", "Military medical centers": "including Walter Reed, have strict security policies after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, and cannot receive mail addressed to \"any soldier\" or \"a recovering patient.\" Such cards would be returned to the post office."}
