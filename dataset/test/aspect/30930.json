{"Lack of supporting evidence": "The claim that Joaqu\u00edn \"El Chapo\" Guzm\u00e1n testified about giving millions of dollars to Nancy Pelosi, Adam Schiff, and Hillary Clinton is not supported by any credible evidence. The original Facebook post by \"Shane Vandiver\" did not provide any links to news articles, videos, interviews, or transcripts to back up the claim.", "Origin of the claim": "The claim appears to have originated from a baseless Facebook post by \"Shane Vandiver,\" who is a musician and not a reliable source of information. Vandiver's post was the earliest and most popular iteration of the claim found, suggesting that it was not based on factual information.", "Lack of specifics": "Vandiver's post and subsequent spread of the claim lacked specific details, such as the exact amounts of money allegedly given, the purpose of the payments, and the method of transactions. This lack of specific information raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Inconsistency with trial proceedings": "The expert's verdict highlights that Joaqu\u00edn \"El Chapo\" Guzm\u00e1n did not testify during his trial. The trial involved multiple witnesses and lasted for several weeks, but the defense's case only lasted about 30 minutes and did not include testimony from Guzm\u00e1n. This inconsistency further undermines the credibility of the claim."}
