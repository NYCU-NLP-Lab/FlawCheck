{"Analysis of Joe Biden": "s voting record: The expert reviewed Biden's 35-year Senate voting record to assess his alignment with liberal orthodoxy on various issues, such as the Iraq War and measures leading to mass incarceration. This analysis revealed instances where Biden broke with liberal positions, suggesting that his claim of being one of the most liberal members of Congress is inaccurate.", "Comparison to ideological rankings": "The expert examined sources that grade lawmakers based on ideology, such as Voteview. These rankings showed that, on average, Biden was more liberal than about 75% of the Senate overall, but among Democrats, he was in the middle of the pack. This comparison contradicts Biden's claim of always being labeled as one of the most liberal members.", "Historical examples of Biden": "s deviations from liberal positions: The expert cited instances where Biden broke ranks with liberal Democrats on certain issues, such as his support for an anti-busing amendment in 1975. These examples demonstrate Biden's willingness to align with conservative positions on social issues, further undermining his claim of being consistently labeled as liberal.", "Perception of Biden": "s image as a moderate Democrat: The expert highlighted how Biden's record and actions have contributed to a perception of him as a moderate Democrat rather than one of the most liberal members. This perception was reinforced by his opponents' unsuccessful attempts to portray him as \"too far left for the state\" during the 1978 election."}
