{"Comparison of job numbers": "The expert compared the claim of 115,000 jobs created in the American auto industry since GM and Chrysler emerged from bankruptcy with the actual job numbers reported by The Plain Dealer, which stated that the two automakers employ 16,500 fewer people nationwide than they did in 2009.", "Analysis of industry scope": "The expert examined the scope of the claim by considering whether it included not only workers at Chrysler and General Motors but also employees at other companies in the auto industry, such as auto parts makers, car dealerships, and parts stores. This analysis was important to understand the overall industry growth and the interconnectedness of different sectors within it.", "Verification of data sources": "The expert checked the accuracy of the data provided by Brian Deese, the deputy director of the White House National Economic Council, who made the claim. The expert independently accessed the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) databases to confirm the numbers cited by Deese and found that they aligned with the reported job growth in the auto industry.", "Evaluation of timeline": "The expert considered the timeline used to measure job growth in the auto industry. They questioned why the measurement started in June 2009, when Chrysler's operations emerged from bankruptcy, but did not take into account that General Motors' bankruptcy ended in July 2009. This evaluation aimed to ensure that the measurement period accurately reflected the impact of the automakers' emergence from bankruptcy on job creation."}
