{"Expert": "s statement: The expert, Dr Philip Ikeme, who is the medical director of the Nigeria, Ghana, and eastern African arm of pharmaceutical giant Sanofi, stated that Nigeria has the highest incidence of diabetes in sub-Saharan Africa. This statement provides an expert opinion on the prevalence of diabetes in Nigeria.", "Reference to studies": "Dr Ikeme directed Africa Check to two studies on diabetes in Nigeria. One study from 2008 cited World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that 1.7 million Nigerians were living with diabetes, while another study from 2014 put the number at 4 million. These studies provide empirical evidence to support the claim.", "Lack of specific data": "The World Health Organisation's most recent report on diabetes does not include specific data on new cases (incidence) of diabetes in Nigeria or sub-Saharan Africa. Dr Gojka Roglic from the WHO's department for non-communicable diseases stated that data on incidence is generally lacking, and there is no data available on incidence for any country in Africa. This highlights the challenge of verifying the claim due to the lack of comprehensive data.", "Prevalence estimate": "The World Health Organisation's most recent data on Nigeria estimates a prevalence of 4.3% in adults for the years 1980 to 2014. While this data does not directly support the claim of over five million Nigerians living with diabetes, it provides a broader context of the prevalence of the disease in the country."}
