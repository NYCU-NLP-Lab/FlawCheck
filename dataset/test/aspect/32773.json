{"Lack of evidence": "The expert points out that there is no evidence to support the claim that Abraham Lincoln expressed or acted upon the sentiment of letting the American people decide on a Supreme Court nomination before the 1864 election. This lack of evidence raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Timing constraints": "The expert explains that even if Lincoln wanted to make a Supreme Court nomination before the election, he would not have been able to fill the open seat due to the timing constraints. Congress was in recess until after the election, so there was no opportunity for Lincoln to designate a successor and have them confirmed by the Senate prior to the election.", "Political considerations": "The expert highlights the complex political landscape during the 1864 election. Lincoln had to manage a coalition of politicians with different interests and secure re-election while dealing with the challenges of a civil war. His decision-making would have been influenced by the need to secure support from War Democrats and other factions. This suggests that the claim about Lincoln's supposed viewpoint may not align with the political realities of the time.", "Electoral strategy": "The expert mentions that Lincoln ran on the ticket of the National Union Party with a Southern Democrat as his vice presidential running mate. He faced a challenge in the general election from George B. McClellan, whom Lincoln had previously removed from command. This context suggests that Lincoln's decisions, including any potential Supreme Court nomination, would have been influenced by his electoral strategy rather than a principled stance of letting the American people decide."}
