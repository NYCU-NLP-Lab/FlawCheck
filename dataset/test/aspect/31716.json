She confirmed that there was no restriction on selling toothpaste and a toothbrush together on a Sunday. This direct communication with city officials adds credibility to the conclusion that the claim is likely false.", "Consulting City Archivist": "To explore the possibility of an old, repealed ordinance, the expert reached out to City Archivist Paul Campbell.
