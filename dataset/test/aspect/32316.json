{"Lack of evidence": "The expert's verdict highlights that there is no evidence to support the claim that mosquitoes can transfer COVID-19 from person to person. The expert emphasizes that COVID-19 is primarily a respiratory virus that spreads between people through droplets generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes.", "Expert statements": "The World Health Organization (WHO) and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) both state that there is no information or evidence to suggest that the new coronavirus can be transmitted by mosquitoes. These expert statements further support the conclusion that mosquitoes do not play a role in spreading COVID-19.", "Mosquito biology": "Joseph M Conlon, an adviser for the American Mosquito Control Association, explains that for a virus to be transmitted through a mosquito bite, the virus must be able to replicate inside the mosquito. He clarifies that none of the coronaviruses, including COVID-19, have been shown to be able to replicate inside mosquitoes.", "Focus on other mosquito": "borne diseases: The expert's verdict mentions that while mosquitoes do not transmit COVID-19, they can still contribute to the severity of the disease if a patient has underlying medical issues due to mosquito-borne diseases such as West Nile virus and dengue fever. This highlights the importance of preventing and controlling these diseases, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic."}
