{"Recounts in Wisconsin have historically had minimal impact on changing election outcomes": "The expert's verdict highlights that previous recounts in Wisconsin, including the 2016 presidential race and the 2011 Wisconsin Supreme Court race, resulted in minimal changes to the margin of victory. This suggests that the chances of the 2020 election outcome in Wisconsin being flipped through a recount are considered unlikely.", "Former Republican Governor Scott Walker has expressed skepticism about the potential for a recount to change the outcome": "The expert's verdict mentions that Scott Walker, a prominent Republican figure, has stated on Twitter that it is unlikely for a recount to alter the election results. This adds weight to the notion that a recount is unlikely to significantly impact the outcome.", "No statewide race in Wisconsin has ever flipped due to a recount": "according to the Wisconsin Elections Commission. The expert's verdict cites the spokesman for the Wisconsin Elections Commission, who states that to their knowledge, no statewide race in Wisconsin has ever been overturned as a result of a recount. This reinforces the idea that the historical precedent does not support the claim that recounts can change the outcome of statewide races in Wisconsin.", "Nationally": "very few statewide races have been flipped through recounts. The expert's verdict references a study by FairVote, an organization advocating for ranked choice voting, which found that since 2000, only three statewide races in the United States have been overturned due to a recount. These races had initial margins of less than 300 votes, indicating that significant changes in outcomes through recounts are rare on a national level."}
