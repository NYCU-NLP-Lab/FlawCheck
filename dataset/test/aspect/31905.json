{"The number of evacuees brought in by Bill White": "The expert's verdict states that the claim of Bill White bringing in 250,000 evacuees is inaccurate. The actual number of evacuees brought in by White is disputed, but it is confirmed that the claim is significantly exaggerated.", "Comparison with other cities": "The expert's verdict compares the number of evacuees brought in by Bill White with the numbers in other cities like Dallas and San Antonio. It is mentioned that Dallas took in about 20,000 refugees and San Antonio housed an estimated 25,000 to 35,000 evacuees. This comparison helps in assessing the accuracy of the claim.", "Duration of stay and welfare status": "The claim suggests that the evacuees brought in by Bill White stayed for over two years and are mostly on welfare. The expert's verdict does not provide a direct analysis of this aspect, but it does mention that many evacuees were still in Houston in August 2006, indicating a significant duration of stay. However, there is no specific information regarding their welfare status.", "Verification of sanctuary city claim": "The claim also accuses Bill White of turning Houston into a sanctuary city. The expert's verdict addresses this accusation separately and states that a previous claim of White offering sanctuary to illegal immigrants was rated as False. This information helps in verifying the authenticity of the claim regarding the sanctuary city status."}
