{"Lack of evidence": "The expert's verdict highlights that there is no evidence to support Trump's claim that the women who accused him were paid a lot of money to make up stories.", "Contradictory statements": "The expert points out that Trump's claim contradicts the information provided in an article by the Hill, which states that the women were not asked to make up stories but rather shared what they believed to be true.", "Payment for support": "The expert mentions that attorney Lisa Bloom arranged payments for two of her clients who accused Trump, but these payments were aimed at supporting them rather than incentivizing them to fabricate stories.", "Loss of jobs and public backlash": "The expert also notes that one of the women, Jill Harth, faced negative consequences after publicly accusing Trump, including losing job opportunities and enduring hate. This suggests that the women may have had genuine motivations for coming forward rather than being paid to make false claims."}
