{"The expert analyzed the statement made by Florida Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam": "who claimed that Florida taxpayers pay tens of millions of dollars a year to feed and house criminal illegal aliens in the prison system.", "The expert examined Putnam": "s Secure Florida First Agenda, which includes the establishment of a community deportation system with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), as evidence of his stance on illegal immigration.", "The expert investigated the methodology used by Putnam to calculate the cost of illegal immigrants in Florida prisons": "including multiplying the state Department of Corrections budget by the percentage of criminal illegal aliens and the average cost to incarcerate an inmate for a day.", "The expert highlighted the issue of terminology": "noting that Putnam's use of the term \"illegal aliens\" encompassed all non-U.S. citizens in the prison system, regardless of their legal status, which could potentially skew the calculation of the cost attributed to illegal immigrants."}
