{"Lack of evidence or credible sources": "The expert's verdict highlights the absence of any recent news articles or publications in Germany or the United States that support the claim of a powder or disinfectant being used to kill the coronavirus on contact and for 14 days after exposure. This lack of evidence raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Expert contradiction": "The expert's verdict includes a statement from Dr. J\u00f6rn Wegner, a spokesman for the German Hospital Association, who categorically denies the existence of any tents, powder, or magical cure as described by the congressman. The contradiction from an authoritative source adds weight to the skepticism surrounding the claim.", "Inconsistent information": "The expert's verdict points out that the congressman's statement may have been influenced by news reports of misting or sterilization stations in China. However, experts have stated that the bleach-type sprays used in these stations are unlikely to be effective against the coronavirus. The inconsistency between the claim and the actual practices observed in China further undermines its credibility.", "Lack of specific details and verification": "The expert's verdict mentions that the congressman's office did not provide additional information about the substance constituting the powder or the name of the Arizona-based company working on it. The absence of specific details and the inability to verify the claim further raises doubts about its authenticity."}
