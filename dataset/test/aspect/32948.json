{"Lack of corroborating evidence": "The expert mentions that there is no news, reports, or any other references to the disappearance of Jason and Jimmy Garret outside of this particular item. This lack of additional evidence raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Inconsistent timeline": "The photograph of the boys with a skeleton was allegedly slipped under the front door of the Garret farmhouse one year after their disappearance. However, no other details or evidence are provided to support this timeline, making it questionable.", "Modern appearance of the photograph": "The expert notes that the photograph attached to the story appears too modern for 1920. This discrepancy in the visual style raises suspicions about the authenticity of the image and its connection to the claimed events.", "Origin of the story": "The expert reveals that the story originated from a Tumblr account titled \"Creepy stuff I made up,\" where the operator creates fictional creepy tales for odd photographs submitted by users. This information strongly suggests that the claim is a work of fiction rather than a true story."}
