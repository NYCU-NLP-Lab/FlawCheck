{"The proposed legislation": "H.R. 6666, known as the TRACE Act, was introduced by U.S. Rep. Bobby Rush from Illinois on May 1, 2020. It aimed to allocate $100 billion to help local agencies identify individuals who may have been exposed to COVID-19 without their knowledge.", "The bill would establish a grant program under the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention": "CDC), allowing local clinics, hospitals, nonprofits, and schools to apply for funding to support COVID-19 testing efforts.", "Some interpretations of the legislation suggested that grant recipients would have the authority to prohibit non": "vaccinated individuals from entering their facilities, but this claim was fact-checked and debunked by Snopes.", "Concerns were raised that the bill would violate constitutional rights by allowing federally": "administered testing groups to enter homes against owners' will and force individuals to undergo COVID-19 testing, even if they did not wish to do so. These fears were further exaggerated, with claims that testing groups could forcibly vaccinate individuals and take their children."}
