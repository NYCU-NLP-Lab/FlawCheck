{"The expert": "s investigation involved a thorough search through all of the Newsweek issues from 1979, where the alleged quote was claimed to have been published. However, no evidence of George Soros ever making such a statement was found.", "The expert also conducted a broader search of news clips and publications": "but no legitimate record of Soros saying the quote in any other source was discovered. This lack of credible sources mentioning the quote over the past 40 years adds to the skepticism of its authenticity.", "Laura Silber": "the chief communications officer for the Soros-funded Open Society Foundations, explicitly denied that Soros ever made any such statement. Silber emphasized that Soros cares deeply about the United States and is committed to strengthening the country for all its people.", "The alleged quote was found to be partially used in a 2011 Breitbart article": "but no details were provided regarding when or where Soros supposedly said it. The lack of context and the article's failure to substantiate the claim further cast doubt on its authenticity."}
