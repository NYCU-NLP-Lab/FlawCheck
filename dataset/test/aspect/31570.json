{"Testimony from former landscapers": "The expert's verdict mentions that the Boston Globe sent a team of reporters to Guatemala to track down three former landscapers who claimed to have worked illegally on Romney's lawn. Their testimonies provide evidence supporting the claim that illegal immigrants were hired.", "Pay and working conditions": "The expert's verdict states that the workers said they were paid in cash, ranging from $9 to $10 an hour, for working long hours. This aspect supports the claim as it aligns with the typical payment and working conditions for undocumented workers.", "Lack of inquiry about immigration status": "The expert's verdict mentions that the former landscapers claimed that Romney had never inquired about their immigration status during casual encounters over the years. This aspect suggests that Romney may have been aware or indifferent to the workers' illegal status.", "Denial and lack of knowledge": "The expert's verdict mentions that Romney initially responded with \"Aw, geez\" when questioned about the hiring of illegal immigrants. Later, his campaign issued a statement claiming that Romney knew nothing about the immigration status of the workers and that his dealings were solely with the owner of the company. This aspect highlights Romney's denial and lack of knowledge regarding the hiring of illegal immigrants, which can be seen as an attempt to distance himself from the claim."}
