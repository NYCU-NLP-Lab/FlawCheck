{"The expert reached out to individuals who shared the claim on social media for evidence": "but the provided sources were not relevant to the claim of 18 million illegal immigrants receiving government checks.", "The expert cited a 1997 report by the U": "S. Government Accountability Office, which discussed the types of benefits undocumented immigrants can receive, but it did not support the claim that 18 million undocumented immigrants received government checks.", "The expert referenced a November 2018 study by the Pew Research Center": "which estimated the total number of illegal immigrants in the U.S. to be far lower than 18 million, making it impossible for that many individuals to receive government checks.", "The expert highlighted that unauthorized immigrants are generally ineligible for government assistance": "and their U.S.-born children may only be eligible for emergency Medicaid in certain cases, but this does not account for a significant portion of the population claimed to have received checks."}
