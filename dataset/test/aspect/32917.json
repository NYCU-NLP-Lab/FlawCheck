{"Lack of systematic data collection": "The expert's verdict highlights that the U.S. government does not systematically collect data on every person crossing the land border between the United States and Mexico. This means that there is no comprehensive information available on visa holders exiting the U.S. through land ports of entry.", "Pilot programs and initiatives": "While there are some pilot programs and initiatives in place to gather information about people leaving the country, these measures are not enforced at every land port. This suggests that the existing efforts to track visa holders leaving the U.S. through land crossings are limited and not implemented uniformly.", "Data collection challenges": "The expert's verdict mentions that it is challenging to obtain advance information from land travelers, as most of them leave in private vehicles or on foot. This poses physical, logistical, and operational obstacles to effectively collect data from individuals exiting the United States through land ports, particularly at the southwest border.", "Limited information from land travel": "The verdict also highlights that the process of recording the departure of outbound travelers through land ports is still under development. This implies that there is a lack of comprehensive and accurate data on visa holders' movements when they leave the U.S. and enter Mexico via land, making it difficult to determine if they have returned to their country of origin."}
