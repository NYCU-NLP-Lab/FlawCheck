{"Trump": "s claim that wind farms kill more than 1 million birds a year is an exaggeration. Scientific studies have estimated a wide range of mean estimates for bird mortality due to wind farms, from 20,000 to 573,000 bird deaths per year.", "The U": "S. Fish and Wildlife Service estimates that wind turbines may kill half a million birds a year, which is lower than Trump's claim but still significant.", "K": "Shawn Smallwood, an ornithologist, published a study estimating 573,000 bird fatalities per year, including 83,000 raptor fatalities. This study took into account the country's wind energy production capacity at the time.", "Another study published in Biological Conservation by Scott Loss and colleagues also indicates that bird collision mortality at U": "S. wind facilities is likely to increase with the expansion of wind energy production, but it does not provide an estimate of 1 million bird deaths per year."}
