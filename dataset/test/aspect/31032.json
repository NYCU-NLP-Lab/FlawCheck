{"The photos were originally shared on Facebook with a Sinhala caption that translates to English as": "Innocent people suffer more than we think. Hope their expectations will be realized one day.\" This caption suggests that the photos were meant to depict the hardships faced by common people in Sri Lanka.", "The photos were also shared on multiple other Facebook posts": "alongside similar claims about the plight of a worker in Sri Lanka. These posts received comments from Facebook users who believed the claim and further discussed the situation in Sri Lanka.", "A reverse image search conducted through a keyword search on Google revealed that the photos actually show a security guard eating a meal in Malaysia": "The photos were posted by a Malaysia-based Facebook user with a caption that explains the worker's modest meal and his dedication to supporting his family in the village.", "Further examination of the photos revealed specific details that indicate the worker is from Malaysia": "such as the badge on his shirt reading \"Paraforce,\" a security firm based in the Malaysian state of Selangor, and his ID badge lanyard reading \"National Heart Association of Malaysia.\" These details provide additional evidence that the photos were not taken in Sri Lanka."}
