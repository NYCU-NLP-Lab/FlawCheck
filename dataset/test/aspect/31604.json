{"Lack of concrete information": "The expert notes that there is a persistent rumor about Hillary Clinton making disparaging remarks about nurses in the 1990s. However, there is a lack of concrete information about what she actually said, when she said it, or how the public became aware of the comment.", "User inquiries and responses": "The expert mentions that users on forums, such as AllNurses, have inquired about the alleged remarks made by Hillary Clinton. Users responded to these inquiries by asserting that they distinctly remembered Clinton making such a remark but were unable to provide any documented evidence. Some users attributed the lack of evidence to the limited availability of information on the internet at the time.", "Similar rumors and explanations": "The expert highlights that similar rumors resurfaced in different forums at various times, with claims that Clinton called nurses \"glorified babysitters\" or \"overpaid\" and \"nothing but doctor's handmaidens.\" Again, users explained the lack of evidence by stating that these statements were made before widespread internet documentation.", "Accusations without evidence": "The expert mentions that while evidence is lacking, there is no shortage of accusations against Clinton regarding her alleged remarks about nurses. Accusations have been made in different years, such as in 2007 and 2016, suggesting that Clinton said nurses were \"overpaid and undereducated.\" However, the lack of evidence remains an important aspect in verifying the authenticity of these claims."}
