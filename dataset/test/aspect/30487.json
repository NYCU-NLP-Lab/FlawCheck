{"Lack of credible sources": "The expert points out that there is no record of a Johnston Wilson McGill working for Hillary Clinton and no genuine news reports about his alleged death. This lack of verifiable sources casts doubt on the authenticity of the claim.", "Satirical origins": "The claim originated from a satirical website, The Last Line of Defense, known for publishing fake news. The expert highlights that the website includes a disclaimer stating that all of its content is satirical. This suggests that the claim is not based on factual information.", "Inconsistent timeline": "The expert mentions that Trey Gowdy concluded his investigation into the Benghazi email scandal in July 2016, while the claim suggests that J.W. McGill was summoned to testify before Gowdy's congressional committee. This inconsistency in the timeline raises further doubts about the claim's authenticity.", "Conspiracy theories": "The expert notes that conspiracy theorists quickly began spreading the claim that McGill was killed to protect Hillary Clinton. This highlights the presence of unfounded speculation and the potential for the claim to be driven by conspiracy theories rather than factual evidence."}
