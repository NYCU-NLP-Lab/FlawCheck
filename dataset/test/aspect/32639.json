{"The video in the misleading Facebook post has multiple watermarks on it": "indicating that it was originally posted on the Rumoaohepta7 channel on YouTube. The channel has a significant number of subscribers, providing evidence of the video's source.", "Cyrillic script is visible throughout the footage": "including phrases like \"Battle Mode\" and \"Russian Air Force.\" This suggests a Russian origin for the video.", "Sections of the footage in the misleading post have been matched with Russian media coverage of Russian military exercises and activities": "For example, footage of the RS-24 Yars missile test in September 2017 and the first launch of Iskander-M missiles outside of Russia in June 2017 have been found in Russian media reports.", "The September 2017 launch of Caliber cruise missiles from the Russian frigate Admiral Essen": "as seen in RBC coverage, is also depicted in a section of the misleading footage. The credit under the RBC photo further confirms the Russian origin of the footage."}
