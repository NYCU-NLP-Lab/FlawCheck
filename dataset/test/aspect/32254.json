{"The expert": "s verdict highlights that the claim is based on a faulty premise that the U.S. Postal Service does not postmark ballots with prepaid postage. However, the expert clarifies that the Postal Service does postmark these ballots, although there may be isolated incidents of some ballots not being postmarked.", "Wayne Thorley": "Nevada\u2019s deputy secretary of state for elections, provides evidence that during the primary election in June, more than 450,000 prepaid mail-in ballots were cast, and all of them included a postmark. This information contradicts the claim that there is a potential for massive fraud due to the lack of postmarking on prepaid mail-in ballots.", "The expert points out that the concern about": "massive fraud\" is exaggerated, as the claim suggests that voters could wake up on Wednesday morning, see that they don't like the election results, and then drop their ballots in the mail. However, Nevada law requires that ballots be postmarked by a specific date to be counted, and any ballots postmarked after that date are rejected.", "The expert also mentions that the claim incorrectly states that voters have several days after the election to mail in their ballots and have them count towards the candidate they want": "In reality, Nevada law allows for a specific timeframe for ballots to be received and counted, and any ballots received after that period are not counted. This information challenges the claim's assertion that the election could change days later in Nevada due to mailed-in ballots."}
