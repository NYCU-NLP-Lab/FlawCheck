{"Lack of evidence of a fire": "The expert's verdict states that there is no evidence to support the claim that the protesters burned the horses to death. The absence of any fire occurring when a truck towing a horse trailer drove through the crowd was a crucial aspect in verifying the authenticity of the claim.", "Ongoing investigation": "The police have not released further details regarding the incident and are conducting an investigation. This aspect highlights the need for more information before making any definitive conclusions about the claim.", "Contradictory eyewitness accounts": "Eyewitnesses reported different events during the protest, with some stating that the protesters allowed a black woman to drive through on the interstate but blocked the path of a white man towing a horse trailer. This disparity in accounts adds complexity to the claim and emphasizes the importance of gathering more information.", "Lack of visual evidence": "Videos of the incident show protesters throwing items at the truck and trailer, but there is no clear evidence of any fire or any object being thrown into the trailer. The absence of visual evidence supporting the claim further weakens its authenticity."}
