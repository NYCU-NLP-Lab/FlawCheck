{"The claim falsely states that Nancy Pelosi": "wouldn't release 8.5 billion for Coronavirus without abortion funding.\" However, a House bill providing $8.3 billion for relief was already signed into law, and the \"abortion funding\" claim is a distortion of a separate debate over a different bill.", "There was a debate between Republicans and Democrats over language in a House bill providing relief for the coronavirus pandemic": "This debate raised concerns about whether the bill could potentially allow federal funds to be used for abortions. However, the bill, known as the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, was eventually passed by the House, Senate, and signed by President Trump. It does not contain any provisions related to abortion funding.", "The claim inaccurately suggests that Trump went around Pelosi to declare a national emergency and obtain": "50 billion. In reality, Trump's declaration of a national emergency over COVID-19 came days after the approval of the $8.3 billion relief bill. The national emergency declaration provides access to over $42 billion for states and localities, in addition to the initial relief funding.", "The claim conflates and confuses provisions from separate legislative proposals": "The mentioned $8.5 billion refers to the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act, which was approved before the claim appeared on Facebook. It is false to say Pelosi refused to release this funding. The claim also misrepresents the purpose of Trump's national emergency declaration, as it was not directly related to obtaining the $8.5 billion or abortion funding."}
