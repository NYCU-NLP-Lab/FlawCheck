{"Lack of official count": "The expert points out that there is no official count of job losses due to the sequester, making it difficult to evaluate the claim's authenticity.", "Incomplete response from Reid": "s office: The expert mentions that they emailed Reid's office to inquire about the source behind his statement but did not receive a response. This lack of clarification raises doubts about the claim's validity.", "Discrepancy with Congressional Budget Office": "CBO) estimate: The CBO estimated that sequestration would reduce the number of jobs by 750,000 by the end of the year, which is significantly lower than the 1.6 million jobs claimed by Reid. This inconsistency raises questions about the accuracy of Reid's statement.", "Forecasted range of employment increase": "The CBO's model suggests that canceling the sequestration would potentially boost employment by anywhere between 300,000 to 1.6 million jobs. However, this is a forecast for the future and not an actual count of jobs already lost, further casting doubt on the claim's authenticity."}
