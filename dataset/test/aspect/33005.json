{"Testimony from experts": "The expert's verdict includes statements from two experts, Dr. Benjamin Neuman and Dr. Julian Leibowitz, who both express skepticism about the effectiveness and safety of UV wands for disinfecting against the novel coronavirus. Their opinions provide a critical evaluation of the claim's authenticity.", "Contradiction with official guidelines": "The World Health Organization's warning against using UV lamps to disinfect hands or skin contradicts the claim made in the ad that the product is effective for such purposes. This contradiction raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim and undermines its credibility.", "Lack of scientific evidence": "The expert's verdict highlights the absence of scientific evidence supporting the claim that UV wands can eliminate 99.9% of viruses and bacteria in just 10 seconds. This lack of empirical data weakens the authenticity of the claim and suggests it may be exaggerated or misleading.", "Potential health risks": "The expert's verdict emphasizes the potential risks associated with using UV light on bare skin, including the increased risk of skin cancer. This information casts doubt on the claim's authenticity and raises concerns about the safety of using UV wands as advertised."}
