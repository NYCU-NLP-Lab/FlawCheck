This suggests that the authenticity of the claim was verified through an investigation into the cyber attack.", "Conflicting information provided by the state Department of Education": "The claim made by state Rep. H. Marlene O'Toole that the delay was solely due to a cyber attack conflicted with information provided by the state Department of Education. This conflicting information may have been considered in verifying the authenticity of the claim.", "Admittance of software issues by the testing vendor": "The testing vendor, AIR, admitted that an update they performed had inadvertently degraded system performance, resulting in the delays experienced by districts.
