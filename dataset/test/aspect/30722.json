{"Lack of substantiating evidence": "The expert points out that there is no evidence provided in any of the articles to support the claim that a pastor was eaten by crocodiles. This includes the absence of any reason for the pastor's presence in South Africa or his decision to demonstrate walking on water in an area known as the \"Crocodile River.\"", "Similarity to a previous story": "The expert notes that the story bears a striking resemblance to a similar claim from 2016, with the only difference being the names involved. This similarity raises doubts about the authenticity of the current claim.", "Unvetted sources": "The expert highlights that the initial publication of the claim appeared on Zimbabwe Today, which is an independent online newspaper that relies on unvetted community submissions. This raises concerns about the reliability and credibility of the source.", "Lack of verification through online search": "The expert mentions that a Google search for the supposed pastor's name, Jonathan Mthethwa, yielded no results other than republications of the claim by news outlets. This inability to verify the existence of the pastor adds further doubt to the claim's authenticity."}
