{"Former Gov": "Pat McCrory's statement: The expert's verdict mentions that former Gov. Pat McCrory claimed that the North Carolina bathroom bill was \"never really repealed.\" This statement is one aspect that was employed to verify the authenticity of the claim.", "Continuation of HB2": "The expert's verdict includes comments from Ben Graumann, communications director for Equality NC, and Chris Sgro, communications director for the Human Rights Campaign, who referred to the new law HB 142 as \"a continuation of HB2.\" This highlights another aspect that supports the claim that the bathroom bill was not fully repealed.", "Repeal of only one section": "The expert's verdict states that HB 142 repealed only one of the four sections of HB2. This indicates that the controversial parts of the original bill were not completely removed, strengthening the argument that the bill was not fully repealed.", "Modified versions of controversial parts": "The expert's verdict mentions that the other three sections of HB2 were re-established in modified versions under HB 142. This suggests that although changes were made, the essence of the controversial provisions remained, further supporting the claim that the bill was not fully repealed."}
