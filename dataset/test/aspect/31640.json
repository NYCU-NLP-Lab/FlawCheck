{"The labor force participation rate": "The expert looked at the labor force participation rate, which is a measurement of the health of the labor market. They examined the data from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics to determine if the claim about the lowest labor force participation rate since 1978 was accurate.", "Comparison to historical data": "The expert compared the current labor force participation rate to historical data to determine if it was indeed the lowest in over three decades. They noted that the rate had been increasing since 1948, peaked in the late 1990s and 2000, and then recently hit its lowest point in 36 years. They also mentioned that it had fallen 2.9 percentage points since Obama took office in January 2009.", "Examination of other job indicators": "The expert acknowledged that while the labor force participation rate is an important measure, there are other indicators to consider when evaluating the health of the labor market. They mentioned the unemployment rate as another measurement and highlighted the fact that the country had added 8 million jobs since the passing of the health care law in 2010.", "Consideration of external factors": "The expert recognized that it is challenging to attribute the state of the labor force solely to Obama's policies. They mentioned the slow economic recovery from the 2007-09 recession, which may have influenced people's decisions to go back to school, stay at home with their kids, or give up on actively looking for work."}
