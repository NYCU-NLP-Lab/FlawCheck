{"Reports of a clash between authorities and the caravan": "The expert's verdict mentions that there were reports of a clash between Mexican authorities and the Central American caravan, where the migrants allegedly attacked Mexican agents with rocks, glass bottles, and fireworks. This incident supports the claim that attackers used rocks near the border.", "Social media posts and photographs": "The expert's verdict mentions a Facebook post that showed a photograph of a Border Patrol Officer who was purportedly \"beaten to death with a rock.\" This social media post and photograph were used to justify President Trump's initial suggestion that rock-throwing should be considered an attack with firearms.", "Investigation into the death of Border Patrol Officer Rogelio Martinez": "The expert's verdict mentions that Martinez died while on patrol, and President Trump asserted that he had been \"killed\" by human agents. However, evidence suggests that Martinez's death was accidental, resulting from falling down a culvert on a dark night, rather than being attacked or deliberately killed with a rock.", "Location and circumstances of Martinez": "s death: The expert's verdict states that Martinez was found dead in a culvert located along a quiet interstate, more than 100 miles from El Paso and about 30 miles from the border. This information provides context to the claim and suggests that the incident did not occur directly at the border."}
