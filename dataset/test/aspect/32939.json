{"The claim is based on a quote taken out of context from Barack Obama": "s visit to Kenya in July 2018. The quote, \"Three years ago, I visited Kenya as the first sitting American president to come from Kenya,\" was used to support the claim that Obama admitted to being born in Kenya.", "However": "the quote is referring to Obama's visit to Kenya in July 2015, where he attended the annual Global Entrepreneurship Summit. It does not imply that he was born in Kenya.", "The article misrepresents Obama": "s comment as a \"slip\" and suggests that it should reignite the birther claims about his birthplace. This is misleading and does not accurately represent the context of Obama's statement.", "The article cites a poll from December 2016 that found one": "third of Americans doubted Obama's birthplace, with 12 percent responding \"Definitely True\" and 24 percent responding \"Probably True\" to the statement \"President Obama was born in Kenya.\" The article uses this doubt to further support the need for an investigation into Obama's eligibility to be president, despite the overwhelming evidence that he was born in Hawaii."}
