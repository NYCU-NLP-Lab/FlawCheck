State Department's 'no travel' list in 1981, which would imply that Obama could not have traveled there as a U.S. citizen.", "The expert": "s verdict highlighted that the entire argument relied on the premise that Pakistan had a travel ban in 1981. However, the U.S. Department of State confirmed that there was no travel ban to Pakistan during that time.", "The expert mentioned that the author of the e": "mail may have confused a travel warning or travel advisory with a travel ban. The University of Illinois at Chicago Library had an archive of State Department documents that included a travel advisory for Pakistan issued on August 17, 1981, but it did not indicate any illegality in traveling to Pakistan.", "Additional evidence supporting the authenticity of Obama": "s travel to Pakistan in 1981 was found through a travel article published in the New York Times in June 1981, which made no mention of illegal travel to Pakistan. Furthermore, a letter to the editor by the U.S. Consul General in Lahore, Pakistan, encouraged people to visit, and an advertisement in the New York Times listed Karachi and Lahore as travel destinations in their package."}
