{"The number of voters who supported referendums since 2012": "The expert's verdict mentions that Governor Tony Evers was referring to the number of voters who supported referendums since 2012, which includes both referendums for exceeding spending caps and building construction or upgrades. The data gathered by the state Department of Public Instruction shows that about 2 million voters supported additional spending of some kind since 2012, with 1.1 million backing taking on debt for buildings and over 900,000 supporting additional money for ongoing expenses.", "Record number of approved referendums": "The expert's verdict states that a record number of referendums have been approved in recent years, with voters across the state favoring 45 of the 60 referendums in the 2019 spring election, resulting in a 75% approval rate. In 2018, voters approved over $2 billion in additional school spending through referendums.", "Connection between Republican control and approved referendums": "The expert's verdict questions whether it is fair to connect the approval of referendums to Republican control in the state. It mentions that local school districts are subject to state-mandated caps on spending per pupil, which were instituted by former Republican Governor Tommy Thompson. These caps, called revenue limits, restrict how much money the district is able to spend per student. This aspect highlights the relationship between Republican policies and the need for referendums to address funding shortfalls.", "Voluntary decision to raise property taxes": "The expert's verdict mentions that Governor Tony Evers claimed that more than a million Wisconsinites have \"voted to raise their own property taxes\" due to Republicans' lack of school funding. This aspect emphasizes that the decision to raise property taxes through referendums is a voluntary action taken by residents to address the funding gap in public schools."}
