{"Overly broad definition of a school shooting": "The expert's verdict highlights concerns about the definition of a school shooting used by the organization Everytown for Gun Safety. The group's definition includes incidents where no one is killed and even accidental discharges of firearms. This broad definition raises questions about the accuracy of the claim.", "Inclusion of incidents not commonly understood as school shootings": "The expert's verdict mentions that the tally of 12 school shootings in Georgia includes incidents that may not be commonly understood as school shootings. This includes an accidental self-inflicted gunshot by a student and a suicide attempt in a college parking deck. The inclusion of these incidents may skew the statistics and misrepresent the severity of the issue.", "Exclusion of incidents that meet the common understanding of a school shooting": "The expert's verdict notes that only one incident in Georgia met the more commonly understood definition of a school shooting. This incident involved a gunman storming a school with a semi-automatic rifle, but no one was injured due to the intervention of a brave staff member. The exclusion of such incidents from the count raises questions about the accuracy and relevance of the claim.", "Lack of clarity in methodology and criteria": "The expert's verdict highlights the transparency of Everytown for Gun Safety regarding their methodology and criteria for classifying school shootings. However, the inclusion of incidents based on press documentation or confirmation from law enforcement raises concerns about the reliability and consistency of the data. The lack of clarity in the methodology used to verify the authenticity of the claim undermines its credibility."}
