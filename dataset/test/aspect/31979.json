{"The claim is supported by a specific source": "The claim that Sherrod Brown \"sent billions of our tax dollars to foreign countries\" is supported by an article published in the Washington Times on September 9, 2010. The article mentions that the Department of Energy acknowledged that a significant portion of green energy programs and manufacturing tax credits went to foreign firms, primarily in China, South Korea, and Spain.", "The claim is based on a report by American University": "s Investigative Reporting Workshop: The claim also references a report by American University's Investigative Reporting Workshop, which stated that more than 79 percent of the first $2.1 billion in stimulus grants for wind energy companies went to foreign firms. This report adds further credibility to the claim.", "Brown called for the suspension of the program": "Despite not being mentioned in the Washington Times article, Sherrod Brown was one of the senators who called for the Obama administration to suspend the program that sent funds to foreign companies. Brown co-sponsored legislation to ensure that funds only support projects that create jobs in the United States. This aspect verifies that Brown took action to address the issue raised in the claim.", "Democrats insisted on spending the money at home": "The Washington Times article mentioned that leading Democrats in Congress raised concerns about the funds going to foreign firms. This aspect highlights the broader context and shows that there were discussions and debates within Congress about the allocation of funds to foreign countries."}
