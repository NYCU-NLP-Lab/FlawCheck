{"Lack of credible sources": "The expert's verdict highlights that the claim originated from a website known for publishing fake news and lacked important details such as the victim's name, the hospital where he was treated, and the specific country where the incident occurred. This lack of credible sources raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Inconsistent information": "The expert's verdict points out that the original article and its replication by another website had minor differences in detail. This inconsistency raises questions about the accuracy and reliability of the information presented in the claim.", "Improbable circumstances": "The expert's verdict mentions that the alleged attack occurred on a popular nudist beach, where the man's excessive application of sunscreen to his genitals may have attracted the predatory bird. While this scenario is not impossible, it raises doubts about the likelihood of such an incident happening.", "Biological behavior of the bird": "The expert's verdict explains that the bird involved in the alleged attack, a white-bellied sea eagle, is not known for targeting humans or their genitals. It highlights that these birds are opportunistic feeders and would be unlikely to attack a human in such a manner. This information casts doubt on the plausibility of the claim."}
