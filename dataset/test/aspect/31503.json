{"The origin and spread of the claim": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim was first floated by pro-BJP social media users in August 2016. It further highlights that the same tweet was carried by multiple right-wing fake news sites, indicating a pattern of deliberate misinformation.", "Comparison of images": "The expert's analysis includes a comparison of the pixelated picture of Barkha Dutt on a scooter with a face shot of Hizbul Mujahideen commander Zakir Musa. By examining the items behind Musa in a video and comparing them to the picture of Dutt, it is evident that the snapshot used in the claim was taken from the video. This aspect provides visual evidence to debunk the authenticity of the claim.", "Timeframe and context": "The expert's verdict mentions that Dutt posted the picture of herself on the scooter on August 18th, 2016, during a period of unrest in the valley. This context is important in understanding the circumstances in which the picture was taken and shared, making it less likely that Dutt was involved with a terrorist commander.", "Facial features and appearance": "The expert's analysis highlights the differences in hairstyle, facial hair, and overall appearance between Zakir Musa and the person driving the scooter in Dutt's picture. This aspect emphasizes that the two individuals are different and would require a significant makeover within 24 hours for them to be the same person. It adds further evidence to discredit the claim."}
