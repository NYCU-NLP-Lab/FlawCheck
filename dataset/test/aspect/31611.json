{"Missouri State Highway Patrol report": "The expert verified the authenticity of the claim by referring to the Missouri State Highway Patrol report, which confirmed that there were 1,326 meth lab seizures in Missouri in 2006 and only 50 in 2018.", "DEA": "s 2018 Threat Assessment Report: The expert cited the DEA's report, which states that most methamphetamine in the United States is being produced in Mexico. This supports the claim that Mexico is responsible for the majority of meth smuggling into the United States.", "Decrease in methamphetamine laboratories": "The expert noted that the key factor for the decrease in methamphetamine laboratories in Missouri is the transportation of crystal methamphetamine from Mexico into the state. This indicates that the decrease in lab seizures is due to a shift in production to Mexico.", "Restrictions on pseudoephedrine sales": "The expert mentioned that in 2006, federal and state laws restricted the sale of pseudoephedrine, a key ingredient in home-cooked meth. Missouri also implemented prescription-only ordinances and an electronic tracking system for cold and allergy medications containing pseudoephedrine. These measures contributed to the decrease in meth production within the state."}
