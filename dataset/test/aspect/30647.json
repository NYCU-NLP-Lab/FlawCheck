{"Lack of evidence": "The expert states that no evidence has been provided to support the claim that the Hells Angels Motorcycle Club was heading to Seattle to fight antifa. This lack of evidence raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Outdated media": "The media included in the tweets circulating the claim is a few years old. The expert mentions that the top image was taken in 2018 during a national gathering in Canada, and the brief clip in the second image comes from a 2011 music video by Lady Gaga. This indicates that the media being used to support the claim is not recent or relevant.", "Unrelated events": "Similar videos claiming to show the Hells Angels heading to Seattle to fight antifa can be traced back to old and unrelated events. The expert mentions a video from 2010 being used to falsely support the claim. This suggests that the videos being circulated are not directly related to the claimed event.", "Dismissal by Sonny Barger": "Sonny Barger, the founder of the Hells Angels, has issued a statement refuting the rumor. In a Facebook post, he explicitly states that the claim is untrue and will never happen. Barger's dismissal adds credibility to the expert's verdict and undermines the authenticity of the claim."}
