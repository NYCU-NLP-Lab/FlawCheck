{"The image featured in the claim is actually a movable painted model created by a Japanese artist named Mushibuchi": "who creates and sells toy sculptures.", "Mushibuchi has posted several other images on their Twitter feed that clearly show the creation process of these toy models": "although there were no specific images showing the development of the hornet model in question.", "The featured toy model is much larger than a real Asian giant hornet": "which typically only grows to about two inches long.", "The Asian giant hornet does have a potentially deadly sting": "as confirmed by experts like Shunichi Makino and Justin O. Schmidt, who explain the venom's effects on red blood cells and the potential for allergic reactions leading to fatalities. Additionally, the hornets are known to cause significant damage to honeybee hives."}
