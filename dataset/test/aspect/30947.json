{"The comprehensive study of the Savannah River Estuary": "The expert mentions that the claim is based on a study conducted by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. This study, called the \"Tier II Environmental Impact Statement for the Savannah Harbor Expansion,\" details the potential environmental impacts of the dredging project and how port planners aim to mitigate them.", "The potential destruction of delicate wetlands": "The expert mentions that deepening the port to accommodate larger ships could result in the destruction of nearby wetlands. This is a significant aspect that needs to be considered when assessing the authenticity of the claim. The study should address how the project plans to mitigate the impact on wetlands.", "The impact on threatened or endangered species": "The Savannah River Estuary is home to 10 threatened or endangered species, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Dredging could potentially affect the estuary, which is a crucial habitat for these species. The study should assess the impact on these species and provide measures to mitigate any negative effects.", "Contested issues": "The expert mentions that there are two heavily contested issues related to the project: preserving the endangered shortnose sturgeon and dealing with the loss of dissolved oxygen in the waterway. These issues highlight potential concerns and weaknesses in the plan. The study should address these issues and provide evidence of how they will be addressed and mitigated."}
