{"The estimate from Standard and Poor": "s: The expert mentions that the estimate from Standard and Poor's, which stated that GDP for the fourth quarter would be 0.6 percent less than it would have been, translates into a $24 billion loss for the economy. This estimate is considered reliable and supports the claim.", "Estimates from other sources": "The expert also mentions that estimates from JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, IHS, and Moody's Analytics ranged from a 0.2 percent to 0.5 percent drop in GDP, which corresponds to approximately $12 billion to $20 billion in economic impact. These estimates provide additional evidence to support the claim.", "Various ways the economy was affected": "The expert explains that the economic impact of the government shutdown resulted from consumers reducing their spending, delays in processing export and import permits, hold-ups in small business loans, and other ways that private-sector activity intersects with the government. This highlights the different aspects of the economy that were affected by the shutdown, reinforcing the claim.", "Need for final economic data": "The expert acknowledges that the final economic data will only be released early next year, which will provide a more accurate assessment of the economic impact. However, based on the available estimates and information, the $24 billion figure is considered reliable and falls within the high end of the estimates. This emphasizes the importance of waiting for the final data but still supports the claim."}
