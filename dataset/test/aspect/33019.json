{"The claim was made by President Barack Obama during a speech in Maryland where he stated that in states where the federal government helps run the marketplaces": "the average American will have more than 50 different plans to choose from, with different levels of coverage.", "The White House and the Department of Health and Human Services pointed to a report by the Department of Health and Human Services that supported the claim": "The report stated that individuals will have an average of 53 qualified health plan choices in states where HHS will fully or partially run the Marketplace.", "The government": "s analysis included 36 states that rely on Washington completely or partially to operate their programs. The report included a table with the states and the number of plans offered in each one, and at the bottom of the column, the cell labeled \"Average, 36 states\" showed the number 53.", "However": "it is important to note that averages can mask wide variations. While the average person would have 53 options, this does not mean that every state would have exactly 53 insurance companies competing for business. Some states, like Arizona and Florida, actually had significantly more options available with 106 and 102 plans respectively. The number of uninsured people in each state also influenced the calculation, meaning states with a larger number of uninsured individuals would have a bigger impact on the average."}
