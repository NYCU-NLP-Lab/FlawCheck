{"The expert": "s verdict is based on a comparison of the percentage of health insurance premiums paid by Wisconsin public employees before and after the collective bargaining reforms. The claim states that most public employees are still paying about 12 to 13 percent of their premiums, while most private sector workers in the state pay 20 to 25 percent.", "The expert verifies the claim by providing data on the percentage of premiums paid by state employees before the reforms": "They state that state workers were paying about 6 percent of their premiums, so doubling that would put it at 12 percent, which aligns with the claim.", "The expert also compares the percentage paid by Wisconsin public employees to the national average for both public and private employees": "They state that the national average is 29 percent, further supporting the claim that Wisconsin public employees pay less than their counterparts outside of government.", "The expert includes additional information on the percentage of premiums paid by local government workers and school employees": "They mention that the collective bargaining reforms do not determine how much local public employees pay towards their premiums, but provide data showing that school employees now pay an average of 10 percent, which is still significantly less than private-sector workers. This information further strengthens the claim that Wisconsin public employees pay less for their health insurance premiums compared to private-sector workers."}
