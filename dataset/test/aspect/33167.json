{"The Congressional Budget Office analysis": "The expert referred to an analysis issued by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) in November, which showed a 21 percent increase in total federal outlays from 2008 to 2011. This analysis provided the primary evidence to verify the authenticity of the claim.", "Temporary factors driving spending increase": "The expert, Jim Horney, explained that the significant increase in spending in 2008 and 2009 was mainly due to the economic downturn and efforts to address it. Factors such as increased spending on unemployment insurance and safety net programs, as well as the Troubled Asset Relief Program and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, contributed to the temporary increase in spending.", "Comparison of spending across administrations": "The expert highlighted that the spending increase crossed administrations, indicating that it was not solely attributed to one president's policies. This information adds context and clarifies that the spending increase was not specific to a particular administration.", "Projected spending for the next three": "year cycle: The expert mentioned that the projected spending for 2012 was only 2.6 percent more than the actual outlays in fiscal 2009-2012. This comparison shows that the rate of spending increase is leveling off, further supporting the expert's statement that the increase in spending was not a permanent trend."}
