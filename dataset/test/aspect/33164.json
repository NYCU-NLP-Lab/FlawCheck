{"Confirmation from Obama": "s spokesman: Obama's spokesman, Kevin Lewis, confirmed that Obama was not present at the G20 summit and was not traveling abroad during that time. This statement adds credibility to the claim that Obama did not attend the event.", "G20 official records": "The G20's official website listed Donald Trump as the U.S. leader, not Obama. This official record contradicts the claim that Obama attended the summit and supports the authenticity of the denial.", "Lack of international news coverage": "If Obama had actually appeared at the G20 summit, it would have made international news and been widely reported. The fact that there was no such coverage further reinforces the claim that Obama did not attend the event.", "Disclaimer on the source website": "The website world-politicus.com, which initially made the claim, states in its \"Disclaimer Policy\" that the information published on their site is not guaranteed to be true. This disclaimer undermines the credibility of the claim and suggests that it may be unreliable."}
