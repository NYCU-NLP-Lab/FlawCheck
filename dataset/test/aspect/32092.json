{"Employment": "Population Ratio: The expert examined the employment-population ratio, which is the proportion of the civilian noninstitutionalized population aged 16 years and over that is employed. The data showed that in most years of the 1970s, the ratio was lower than it was in 2015, with only one year (1979) showing a higher ratio.", "Labor Force Participation": "Another indicator used to compare employment numbers is the labor force participation rate, which compares the number of people in the labor market (whether employed or not) to the total number of people who could be working. The expert found that the labor force participation rates in 1978 and 1979 were higher than in 2015, indicating a larger portion of the population was actively participating in the labor force during those years.", "Aging Population": "The expert also considered the impact of the aging population on the labor force between the 1970s and 2015. Testimony from a senior director at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth highlighted that the retirement of the Baby Boom generation, born between 1946 and 1964, coincided with a decline in labor force participation starting in 2000. This demographic shift has contributed to a lower overall labor force participation rate in recent years.", "Other Measures": "The expert mentioned that they looked into additional measures to gauge the portion of the population that is working but did not provide specific details on these measures. It can be inferred that these measures were employed to further verify the authenticity of the claim but were not explicitly mentioned in the provided information."}
