{"The expert analyzed the history of the candidates": "specifically focusing on their previous races for the position of Insurance Commissioner. They found that Wayne Goodwin had held the office from 2009 to 2017, while Mike Causey became the first Republican to be elected to the office in 2016.", "The expert examined the number of elections for Insurance Commissioner that have taken place since 1990": "They discovered that there have been seven elections during this period. They also found that Causey had participated in many of these elections, although not all of them.", "The expert investigated other political races in which both candidates had participated": "They discovered that Causey had run for Congress in the 6th Congressional District in 2014, but did not make it to the November ballot. He had also run for state Senate in 2002.", "The expert analyzed the term": "perennial candidate\" used by Goodwin to describe Causey. They found that while Causey had run frequently for the position of Insurance Commissioner, he had also participated in other races for different offices. The expert clarified that \"perennial candidate\" may not accurately describe Causey's political career, as it implies running for the same office consistently without variation."}
