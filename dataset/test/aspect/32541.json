{"Lack of verified reports": "The expert mentions that no verified reports of a similar occurrence have been found, indicating a lack of evidence to support the claim.", "Outdated premises": "The expert highlights that the claim is based on outdated premises about how Americans live and work, making it highly unlikely in today's context. This includes the reliance on landlines and the assumption that a woman being away from home during the day means the residence is unoccupied.", "Infeasibility of obtaining phone numbers": "The expert explains that the claim assumes the burglars would need to call the women to lure them away, but with the prevalence of cellphones and the lack of mechanisms to easily match names and addresses to phone numbers, this becomes unlikely.", "Presence of deterrents": "The expert points out that the claim overlooks the possibility of deterrents such as security systems, barking dogs, attentive neighbors, or other factors that could impede a broad-daylight burglary. This contradicts the assumption that burglaries of this nature involve little planning or consideration of potential obstacles."}
