{"Lack of evidence": "The expert's verdict states that there is no evidence to support the claim that Bill Gates tweeted about Donald Trump being one of the greatest presidents, similar to Reagan. This lack of evidence undermines the authenticity of the claim.", "Presence of fake tweets": "The expert mentions that multiple outlets have shared a fake tweet allegedly from Gates, which is dated Jan. 22, 2017. The presence of these fake tweets suggests that the claim is not authentic and has been fabricated.", "Inconsistencies in grammar and spelling": "The expert points out that the fake tweet contains dodgy grammar and spelling errors. This inconsistency further raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim, as it suggests that the tweet may have been created using a website that allows people to generate fake tweets.", "Gates": "previous statements: The expert highlights that Gates has never tweeted about Trump and has been somewhat critical of him in the past. Instead, Gates compared Trump to John F. Kennedy in a phone call, indicating that the claim about him praising Trump as one of the greatest presidents, like Reagan, is unlikely to be true."}
