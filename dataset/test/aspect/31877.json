{"The specific budgetary figures cited by Senator Kyrillos were inaccurate": "He claimed that the annual national deficit climbed from $250 billion a year to $1.6 trillion during Senator Menendez's tenure, but the actual figures were slightly different. The annual deficit reached its highest level in fiscal year 2009 at about $1.4 trillion, not $1.6 trillion as claimed.", "The actual deficit for fiscal year 2011": "when Senator Kyrillos stated the $1.6 trillion figure, was slightly under $1.3 trillion, not the estimated $1.645 trillion as claimed. This discrepancy in the numbers highlights the need for accurate information when discussing budgetary figures.", "Menendez did vote for three major bills that contributed to the increased spending and rising deficits during his tenure": "These bills include the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the stimulus), the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), and payments to mortgage guarantee agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Menendez's support for these measures indicates his involvement in the spending increase.", "However": "it is important to note that the recession also played a significant role in the rising deficits. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office identified the recession and the aforementioned bills as major factors contributing to the increased spending. Ignoring the impact of the recession on federal coffers would be an oversimplification of the situation and may not provide a complete picture of Menendez's responsibility for the deficits."}
