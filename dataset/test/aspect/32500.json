This verifies that Rubio supported funding for Zika-related health clinics during the public health emergency.", "NARAL Pro": "Choice America, a liberal organization supporting abortion rights, aired an ad attacking Rubio's record on Zika, claiming he voted against funding health clinics that provide critical care during the public health emergency. This ad can be considered as evidence of the claim being made.", "Rubio": "s voting record and public statements show that he repeatedly supported Zika funding requests, including those made by President Obama. This further confirms Rubio's support for funding health clinics during the Zika public health emergency.", "Rubio voted with the majority": "68-29, for a motion on an amendment to provide $1.1 billion to combat Zika. He reluctantly voted for the compromise measure while still advocating for Obama's full funding request. This demonstrates Rubio's active involvement in securing funding for Zika-related efforts."}
