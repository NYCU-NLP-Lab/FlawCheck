{"Lack of credible sources": "The expert mentions that they were unable to find any credible source for the quote attributed to George Washington. They specifically mention that it does not appear in \"The Quotable George Washington: The Wisdom of an American Patriot,\" a biography published in 1999 that contains many of Washington's most famous phrases. Additionally, their search of the Fred W. Smith National Library for the Study of George Washington turned up nothing.", "Mount Vernon": "s clarification: The expert highlights that Mount Vernon, Washington's estate, has a web page dedicated to \"spurious quotations\" incorrectly attributed to the founding father. They mention that the Mount Vernon library has yet to find an explanation for this misquote or a similar quote of Washington's that was confused for this statement.", "Misquoting history": "The expert points out that George Washington is one of the most misquoted political figures on the internet. They mention that Washington's estate, Mount Vernon, has a page dedicated to debunking spurious quotations attributed to him. This indicates a pattern of misquoting and misattributing quotes to Washington, raising doubts about the authenticity of the claim in question.", "Lack of historical evidence": "The expert states that the earliest version of the quote they could find was shared on Facebook in an October 2011 post, but it was not accompanied by any credible source information. They also mention that the quote appears to be a modern quote incorrectly attributed to Washington long after his passing in 1799. This lack of historical evidence further casts doubt on the authenticity of the claim."}
