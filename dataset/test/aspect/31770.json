{"The Republican health care bill": "the American Health Care Act of 2017, included a provision that would have allowed insurance companies to charge older adults up to five times more than younger people for health care premiums.", "The claim made by the campaign manager": "Mimi Wilson, stated that George Holding, a Republican representative, voted for the American Health Care Act, which would have implemented the 5-to-1 premium ratio for seniors.", "The Affordable Care Act": "also known as Obamacare, established a cap on the premium ratio for older adults, limiting it to no more than three times the amount paid by younger adults.", "The claim made by the expert": "Coleman, failed to mention the existing cap of three times the premium amount for older adults under the Affordable Care Act, potentially giving the impression that the 5-to-1 ratio proposed by the Republican bill was a more significant change than it actually was."}
