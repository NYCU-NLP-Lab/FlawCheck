{"The claim is based on information posted on the National Association of Realtors": "Realtor Party webpage, which raises concerns about the expiration of Mortgage Forgiveness Tax Relief.", "The claim mentions that without action before the end of the year": "millions of families who hold distressed properties could face a hefty tax bill for trying to modify their mortgage or seek a short sale through their lender.", "The spokesperson for the National Association of Realtors": "Walter Molony, explains that \"distressed properties\" refer to homeowners who owe more on their loans than the property is worth, and the term \"foreclosure tax\" is used to highlight that a family would face income tax on the amount of the loan forgiven after a foreclosure.", "The claim references the Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act passed by Congress in 2007": "which prevents homeowners from being taxed for the cancellation of any debt by a lender during a loan modification or foreclosure. The act applies for the years 2007 through 2012."}
