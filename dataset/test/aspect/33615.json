{"The claim aligns with information from the Social Security System": "s Annual Performance Plan for Fiscal Year 2012, which states that nearly 80 million baby boomers will file for retirement benefits over the next 20 years, averaging around 10,000 per day.", "A 2010 Pew Research Center study supports the claim by stating that baby boomers make up 26 percent of the total U": "S. population and that after 2030, 18 percent of the nation's population will be over the age of 65.", "Census data collected by Pew indicates that there are approximately 79": "6 million people from the baby boomer generation in the United States. When considering the number of births, deaths, and immigrants during those years, it suggests that the estimated number of retirees could be even greater than 10,000 per day.", "By dividing the 79": "6 million people of the baby boomer generation by the number of years remaining until 2030, and then dividing that by 365 days, it calculates a daily average of 11,476 people turning 65, further supporting the claim."}
