{"Lack of evidence": "The expert points out that there is limited data available on the cost of illegal immigration, making it difficult to pinpoint an exact number. Several immigration experts interviewed by PolitiFact were unaware of any study that supports the claim of $250 billion in losses per year.", "Contradictory claims": "The expert highlights that President Trump had previously claimed during the 2016 presidential campaign that illegal immigration costs the country more than $113 billion a year. This claim was rated as Mostly False by fact-checkers.", "Alternative estimates": "The expert mentions that the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), a right-leaning organization seeking to reduce immigration, estimated the total economic impact of illegal immigration to be around $116 billion a year. However, critics argue that FAIR's cost estimates rely on inexact estimates and broad assumptions.", "Criticism of methodology": "The expert cites Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration policy analyst, who deemed FAIR's 2017 report as \"fatally flawed.\" Nowrasteh argues that the report undercounted immigrants' tax revenues and inflated the number of immigrants in the country illegally."}
