{"The claim made by Bill Daley in his campaign ad is reminiscent of similar claims made by his mayoral family members": "suggesting a continuation of their policies.", "The ad promises a": "moratorium on tax hikes to keep families in their homes,\" but fails to clarify that this freeze would only apply to a portion of property tax levies, not the entire bill.", "Property tax bills in Chicago are composed of various levies that fund different entities such as city government": "schools, parks, and other public agencies.", "While Daley": "s freeze pledge applies to the city government's levy, it does not extend to sister city agencies such as the Board of Education and the Chicago Park District, which have a significant impact on property tax bills."}
