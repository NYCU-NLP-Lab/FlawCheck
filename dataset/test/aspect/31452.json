{"Russian government": "s official declaration: The Russian government officially declared George Soros as a wanted man in their country, citing him and his organizations as a \"threat to Russian national security.\" This statement supports the claim that an arrest warrant was issued by Russian President Vladimir Putin.", "Ban on Soros": "charities: In 2015, the Russian government banned Soros' charities, the Open Society Foundations (OSF) and the Open Society Institute, claiming they represented a threat to the country's security. This action further indicates the Russian government's stance against Soros and adds credibility to the claim of an arrest warrant.", "Criticism of Putin": "s actions in Syria: George Soros openly criticized Putin's actions in Syria, accusing him of war crimes and exploiting a power void in the White House ahead of the U.S. presidential elections. This criticism could have led to animosity between Soros and Putin, providing a motive for the alleged arrest warrant.", "Lack of Interpol listing": "It is mentioned that George Soros is not on Interpol's list of people wanted by Russia for international arrest and extradition. This absence of official recognition raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim and contradicts the notion of a formal arrest warrant."}
