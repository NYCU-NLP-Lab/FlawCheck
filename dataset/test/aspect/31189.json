{"Inconsistent policies": "The expert's verdict highlights that counties in Pennsylvania employed inconsistent policies when it came to \"curing\" ballots. This means that some counties notified voters of errors in their mail-in ballots so they could fix them, while others did not.", "No strict party line division": "The expert's verdict refutes the claim that only Democratic counties \"cured\" ballots, while Republican counties did not. It states that all counties received the same guidance to notify political parties and update the ballot-tracking system about ballot errors, allowing voters to cast a provisional ballot on Election Day.", "Legal challenges": "Republicans have lodged challenges in court, arguing that counties that refused to \"cure\" ballots were following state law and a state Supreme Court ruling that prohibited it. Democrats argue that the guidance was clear and legally permissible.", "Allegations of bias": "White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany accused Pennsylvania's Democratic secretary of the commonwealth of using ballot curing to favor the Democratic Party. McEnany claimed that there were disparities created by Democrat election officials, such as setting up satellite offices for early voting in some counties but not others, allowing pre-canvassing in some counties but not others, and allowing ballot curing in some counties but not others."}
