{"The claim is based on the statement made by Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott": "who publicized his call for Congress to investigate a shooting along the U.S.-Mexico border. He stated that there have been \"at least four incidents where bullets from Mexico have crossed the border, putting at risk the safety and security of Texas residents.\"", "The first aspect employed to verify the authenticity of the claim is the confirmation of an incident by the Hudspeth County Sheriff": "s office. According to an Associated Press news article, authorities from the sheriff's office confirmed that road workers near the border were fired upon by an unknown gunman in Mexico on January 13. This incident was referred to by Abbott in his press release.", "The second aspect is the acknowledgment of previous incidents by Abbott himself": "In his letter to President Obama, Abbott mentioned that El Paso's City Hall had been struck by gunfire from the Mexican side of the border and that school buildings at the University of Texas at El Paso had been hit by stray bullets from inside Mexico. These incidents support the claim that bullets have crossed the border.", "The response from the Department of Homeland Security": "provided by Abbott's spokesman Jerry Strickland, is the fourth aspect. Jarrod Bernstein, acting assistant secretary at the Department of Homeland Security, confirmed that border security remains a top priority for the administration and mentioned the deployment of 1,200 National Guard troops to the Southwest border by President Obama. This response indirectly acknowledges the existence of security concerns at the border."}
