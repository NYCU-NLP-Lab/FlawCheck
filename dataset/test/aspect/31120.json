{"The claim that": "700 billion was robbed (from Medicare) to pay for Obamacare\" is a long-standing Republican talking point.", "The Affordable Care Act includes provisions that reduce future increases in Medicare spending": "which can be seen as a way to slow down the rising costs of Medicare.", "The savings from these provisions come at the expense of insurers and hospitals": "not Medicare beneficiaries.", "While some beneficiaries may experience additional costs": "reductions in service, or fewer hospitals that accept Medicare, the idea that Medicare beneficiaries are receiving less generous benefits in order to provide health benefits to younger people is not outrageous."}
