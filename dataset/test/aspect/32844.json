{"The legal term for birthright citizenship is jus soli": "or \"right of the soil.\" This term refers to the practice of granting automatic citizenship to anyone born on a country's soil, regardless of their parents' nationality or heritage.", "The 14th Amendment of the United States Constitution solidifies birthright citizenship in the country": "stating that \"all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.\" This amendment was primarily enacted to grant legal status to emancipated slaves.", "NumbersUSA": "a group advocating for reduced immigration, compiled a list of 33 countries that grant birthright citizenship. This list includes the United States, Brazil, Argentina, and Mexico, as well as most countries in Central and South America. Notably, the United States and Canada are the only \"developed\" countries with unrestricted birthright citizenship laws.", "A trend observed is that countries offering birthright citizenship are predominantly located in the Western Hemisphere": "with no European or East Asian countries having a similar policy. One possible explanation for this is colonialism, as suggested by sociologist John Skrentny."}
