{"The claim made by Kamala Harris was that": "as many as 300,000 autoworkers may be out of a job before the end of the year.\"", "The expert": "s verdict confirmed that this claim was incorrect and misleading. The estimate of 300,000 job losses was a high-end estimate for total job losses, not solely among autoworkers.", "The majority of the potential job losses were due to a threatened tariff on imports of autos and auto parts": "which had not yet been implemented.", "The Center for Automotive Research": "CAR) study, which Harris referred to, projected a worst-case scenario of up to 366,900 total job losses \"economy-wide,\" not limited to autoworkers. The figure of 300,000 autoworkers losing their jobs before the end of the year was not what CAR was projecting."}
