{"Lack of first": "hand evidence: The expert noted that the original poster did not claim to have taken the photographs himself, which raised doubts about the authenticity of the claim. This lack of first-hand evidence made it difficult to verify the accuracy of the photographs.", "Inconsistent labeling of the photographs": "The expert found that the same set of images had been circulated before with different labels. In some versions, the crabs were said to be injected with formalin, while in others they were claimed to be injected with seawater. This inconsistency in labeling raised questions about the accuracy of the claims.", "Unreliable sources": "The expert pointed out that the claims about injected crabs came from unspecified \"reliable reports\" and hearsay, rather than documented evidence or first-hand knowledge. This reliance on unreliable sources made it difficult to trust the validity of the claim.", "Lack of corroborating information": "The expert noted that there was a lack of corroborating information to support either claim. There was no documented evidence or additional information to confirm the presence of formalin or seawater injections in imported crabs. This lack of supporting evidence made it challenging to verify the authenticity of the claim."}
