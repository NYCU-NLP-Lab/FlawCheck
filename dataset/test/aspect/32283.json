{"The claim is widely shared on social media platforms": "including Facebook and a page called Cde Conty Lebepe, The Voice, indicating its popularity and potential reach.", "A Google search reveals articles about Conty Lebepe": "the person associated with the claim, who has a history of being sued for defamation and contravening protection orders. This information raises questions about the credibility and reliability of the source.", "The Facebook post with the claim is not original and has been debunked in the past": "A similar post from 2016 claimed to show Nigerian politicians hiding expensive cars, but it was proven false.", "A reverse image search found articles and a video from China in 2016": "showing a parking lot with abandoned cars, including the same silver Bentley seen in the pictures from the Daily Mail article. These reports explain that the cars were linked to ongoing criminal cases and were prohibited from being claimed by their owners. This information suggests that the images used in the claim may have been taken out of context or misrepresented."}
