This suggests that there is research and data supporting the claim that minorities may face difficulties in registering online for COVID-19 vaccinations.", "Question from Dr": "Dessie Levy: The expert's verdict mentions that Biden's answer was given in response to a question from Dr. Dessie Levy, a woman of color, who specifically asked about racial disparities in healthcare. The fact that a healthcare professional raised this issue adds credibility to the claim that minorities may face challenges in registering online for vaccines.", "Confirmation from The Associated Press": "The expert's verdict states that an analysis from The Associated Press confirmed that relatively small percentages of minorities, particularly Black and Hispanic people, have received COVID-19 vaccines so far. This confirmation from a reputable news organization adds further support to the claim that minorities may have difficulties in accessing vaccine registration information online."}
