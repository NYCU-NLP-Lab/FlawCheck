{"Comparison of job losses under Bush": "The expert analyzed the data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics to verify the claim that millions of jobs were being lost per month during George W. Bush's administration. They found that the highest number of job losses during Bush's tenure was 818,000 in a month, which is not even close to the claim of millions.", "Comparison of job gains under Obama": "The expert also examined the job gains under Barack Obama to determine if the claim of gaining hundreds of thousands of jobs per month for three years was accurate. They found that the average job gains per month during 2010, 2011, and 2012 were 85,000, 153,000, and 157,000 respectively. These numbers do not qualify as \"hundreds of thousands\" as defined by the expert.", "Exaggeration in Michael Moore": "s tweet: The expert pointed out that Michael Moore, the person who made the claim, later sent a corrected tweet acknowledging his exaggeration. This indicates that the initial claim was not accurate and needed correction.", "Lack of specific job types mentioned": "The expert mentioned that since Michael Moore did not specify the types of jobs he was referring to, they used the most basic measure of private sector jobs combined with government jobs (excluding farm jobs or the military). This aspect highlights the need for specific information to accurately verify the claim."}
