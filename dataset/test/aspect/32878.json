{"Lack of evidence for political party affiliation": "The expert's verdict highlights that there was no proof or evidence provided to support the claim that Robert Aaron Long was a registered Democrat. The Georgia Secretary of State's office confirmed that Georgia doesn't register voters by party, and Long's voting history does not indicate his political party preference.", "False information from a fake website": "Some posts circulating online included a screenshot from a fake website that contained incorrect information about Long's political affiliation. This highlights the presence of misinformation and the need for fact-checking before accepting claims.", "Absence of connection to antifa": "The expert's verdict states that there is no evidence linking Long to antifa, a loose collective of activists. While antifa has been associated with protests, there is no organizational structure, and no proof suggests Long's affiliation with them.", "Pattern of false claims regarding political affiliations": "The expert points out that it is not uncommon for internet users to falsely claim that suspects of high-profile crimes are registered Democrats or associated with antifa. Examples of similar false claims regarding other individuals, such as the Capitol attack and previous mass shootings, are provided to highlight the pattern."}
