{"Charles Francis has campaigned on the idea that Raleigh leaders prioritize big projects like building a new City Hall and planning Dix Park over providing more affordable housing and helping poor residents find jobs": "2. Mayor Nancy McFarlane has defended these projects, including the transformation of the Dix property into a destination park, which she considers one of her proudest accomplishments.", "McFarlane has claimed that Francis": "opposed\" the Dix Park project, implying that he would slash funding for parks and open space.", "Francis has denied McFarlane": "s claim and stated that he has never said he would cut spending, but rather that park spending needs to be equitable. However, evidence provided by McFarlane's campaign advisors suggests that Francis has described Dix Park as \"tangential\" and advocated for moving money away from parks like Dix and into affordable housing and transit."}
