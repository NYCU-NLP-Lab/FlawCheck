{"Public Opinion Polls": "The expert cites multiple public opinion polls that show a significant majority of Americans support voter ID laws, including a Rasmussen Reports poll, a Washington Post poll, and a Marquette University Law School poll. These polls provide evidence of public sentiment and support for photo ID requirements.", "Support Across Demographic Groups": "The expert highlights that support for voter ID laws crosses demographic groups, including white respondents, non-whites, blacks, and Hispanics. This suggests that the belief in requiring photo ID to vote is not limited to a specific racial or ethnic group.", "Expert Opinion": "The expert quotes Kenneth Mayer, a professor of political science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, who states that voter ID laws receive overwhelming public support. Mayer's expertise in political science adds credibility to the claim that photo ID requirements are widely accepted.", "Logic and Reasoning": "The expert mentions that Walker argues that voter ID laws make it \"easier to vote and harder to cheat,\" implying that there is a logical connection between photo ID requirements and the prevention of voter fraud. While this aspect may be more subjective, it adds another dimension to the verification process by considering the reasoning behind the claim."}
