{"The U": "6 measurement: The expert verifies that Gingrich's claim is based on the U-6 measurement, which is a federal statistic that provides a broader picture of labor-market weakness than the official unemployment rate. The U-6 measurement includes not only the unemployed but also the underemployed and those who have stopped looking for work.", "The accuracy of Gingrich": "s statement: The expert confirms that Gingrich's statement about the U-6 measurement going up to 13.5 percent is incorrect. The actual U-6 level is higher than Gingrich's claim, indicating a worse labor market situation.", "Concerns about the health of the economy": "The expert acknowledges that there are valid concerns about the health of the economy, as labor market measures have not significantly improved and are still historically high. This supports Gingrich's point about the weak labor market.", "Impact of healthcare law": "The expert acknowledges Gingrich's argument that the implementation of President Obama's healthcare law could lead to companies reducing full-time workers to part-time to avoid providing health coverage. This could have a negative impact on the labor market and contribute to the high U-6 measurement."}
