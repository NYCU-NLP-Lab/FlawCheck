{"The claim of Iran receiving": "1.8 billion in cash carried out in barrels and in boxes from airplanes\" is slightly exaggerated and lacks evidence. The Congressional Research Service reported a total of $1.7 billion, which was the amount settled on to resolve an arms contract between the United States and Iran dating back to 1979.", "Most of the released funds were not under the control of the United States or any U": "S. bank. They were primarily held in central and commercial banks overseas, and it was Iran's own money to begin with, not a payment from any government to buy Iran's cooperation.", "The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action": "the 2015 nuclear agreement, freed up Iranian assets that had been frozen under sanctions. However, the agreement only affected sanctions related to Iran's nuclear program, and Iran still has other frozen assets."}
