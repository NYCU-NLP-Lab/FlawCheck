{"Spread of misinformation": "The expert's verdict highlights that the claim regarding the activation of speed cameras on the M1 and M25 motorways in England with a uniform speed limit of 72 miles per hour was spread widely through social media. The message contained false information, leading to confusion among readers.", "Confirmation from Highways England": "The expert's investigation involved reaching out to Highways England, the government agency responsible for operating England's motorways and major roads. Highways England confirmed that they were not aware of any changes to the speed cameras on the M1 or M25, debunking the claim.", "Previous occurrence of similar misinformation": "The expert's verdict mentions that a similar version of the message regarding speed cameras on the M1 and M25 was shared on social media in February 2018. This indicates a pattern of misinformation being spread, suggesting a potential mischievous intent behind the January 2019 warning.", "Incompatibility with legal speed limits": "The expert points out that the claim stated the speed cameras were set at 72 miles per hour, which contradicts the legal speed limit in the UK. According to the law, motorists are not allowed to travel at a speed faster than 70 miles per hour, regardless of the vehicle or type of road. This inconsistency further discredits the authenticity of the claim."}
