{"The expert verified the claim by examining the statement made by Senator Sheldon Whitehouse": "who stated that the top 400 income earners in the country were paying a tax rate of 16.6 percent. The expert checked the accuracy of this claim by referring to an IRS report on the tax returns of the top 400 individual taxpayers with the highest adjusted gross incomes.", "The expert also confirmed the average adjusted gross income for the top 400 returns": "which was stated to be $344 million. This information further supported the claim made by Senator Whitehouse.", "The expert compared the tax rate of the top 400 income earners to the tax rate of a hypothetical hospital orderly earning": "29,000 a year. By considering the tax rates, standard deductions, and personal exemptions, the expert determined whether the claim that the rich were taxed at a lower rate than the $29,000-a-year worker was accurate.", "Additionally": "the expert mentioned that they personally checked their own tax returns for 2007 and found that their tax rates were even lower than the 16.6 percent mentioned by Senator Whitehouse.
