{"The misrepresentation of a research initiative": "The expert's verdict highlights that the claim misrepresents a research initiative funded by multiple organizations, including the Charles Koch Foundation. The research initiative aims to provide access to Facebook's proprietary data to independent researchers, not to the Koch brothers or other conservative political operatives.", "Verification from a spokeswoman": "The expert cites a spokeswoman for the Hewlett Foundation who confirms that the claim is false. The spokeswoman states that the funders of the research initiative, including the Charles Koch Foundation, will not have access to the data.", "Reference to a nonpartisan organization": "The expert refers to the Social Science Research Council, a nonpartisan organization that will manage the peer-review process and proposal selection for the research initiative. The organization's \"frequently asked questions\" page explicitly states that the funders will not have access to the data.", "Identification of other organizations involved": "The expert mentions that the research initiative is being funded by seven organizations, including the Charles Koch Foundation, the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, Democracy Fund, the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, Laura and John Arnold Foundation, and Omidyar Network. This information helps verify the authenticity of the claim by providing additional sources involved in the initiative."}
