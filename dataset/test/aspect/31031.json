Fitzgerald acknowledged that the lame-duck bills were meant to maintain a balance of power, while Roth claimed that no power was taken away from the governor and attorney general. These statements provide evidence of conflicting views on the impact of the bills.", "Criticism from various sources": "The expert's verdict mentions that the lame-duck bills drew criticism from former Republican Governor Scott McCallum and longtime Republican donor Sheldon Lubar. This aspect verifies that there were concerns raised about the potential loss of power for the governor and attorney general.", "Narrow interpretation vs": "broader understanding of power: The expert's verdict discusses the narrow and technical view presented by Roth's spokeswoman, Angela Roidt, who argued that the powers of the governor and attorney general were not affected because they are outlined in the state Constitution. However, the expert points out that power can be defined as the ability to act or produce an effect, suggesting a broader understanding of power. This aspect highlights the differing interpretations of power and its impact on the claim."}
