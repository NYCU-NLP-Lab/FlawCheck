{"Definition of pandemic": "The expert referred to the Merriam-Webster online dictionary's definition of pandemic, which states that it is an outbreak of a disease that occurs over a wide geographic area and affects a significant proportion of the population. The expert highlighted that COVID-19 meets this definition as it has affected all continents except Antarctica and has resulted in millions of cases and deaths worldwide.", "Expert opinion": "The expert cited the statement of Adm. Brett Giroir, assistant secretary for health for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, who strongly disagreed with the claim and affirmed that COVID-19 is indeed a pandemic. Giroir emphasized that the virus is spreading across the world, causing hundreds of thousands of deaths, and is a serious matter that should not be dismissed as phony or fake.", "Consensus among authorities": "The expert conducted a search of 10 science and health authorities globally, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization, and found that each one describes COVID-19 as a pandemic. This consensus among reputable authorities further verifies the authenticity of the claim that COVID-19 is a pandemic.", "Local impact and evidence": "The expert mentioned that the district represented by Virginia Rep.-elect Bob Good has experienced over 300 deaths from COVID-19, as reported by The Washington Post. This local impact provides tangible evidence of the seriousness of the virus and contradicts Good's claim that it is a phony pandemic. Despite reaching out to Good's spokesperson for clarification, no response was received, further suggesting the lack of evidence or explanation for the claim."}
