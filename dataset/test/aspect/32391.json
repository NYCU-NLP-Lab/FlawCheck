{"The claim is based on a statement made by Mitt Romney in which he says": "class sizes don't matter.\" This statement is supported by a Washington Times headline declaring \"Romney downplays value of small class size.\"", "The claim is further supported by an ad released by the Barack Obama campaign": "in which parents Kevin and Caroline state that their children's best experiences have been in the classroom, contrasting with Romney's alleged stance on class sizes.", "The expert refers to Education Week": "an independent journal, which reports that while most research supports the idea that small classes have benefits for students, smaller classes do not automatically translate into better learning. This suggests that the claim made by Romney may have some validity.", "Romney himself provides evidence to support his claim by mentioning a study conducted by the consulting firm McKinsey Global Institute": "which compares class size and student performance among several countries. According to Romney, the study found that the highest-performing schools in the world have similar classroom sizes to those in the United States, indicating that class size may not be the determining factor for success in education."}
