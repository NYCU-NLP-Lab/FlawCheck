{"The claim was based on articles from unreliable and disreputable websites": "namely Conservative Post and American News, which featured nearly identical content lacking details and context but aimed at generating outrage.", "The claim referenced a 2012 Journal of Medical Ethics paper titled": "After-Birth Abortion: Why Should the Baby Live?\" by Alberto Giubilini and Francesca Minerva. However, the authors were neither American nor liberals, and their paper did not advocate for the merits of infanticide. The paper had also received global disagreement and criticism upon its submission in 2011.", "The authors of the paper clarified in a public letter on the Journal of Medical Ethics blog that they never intended to suggest that after": "birth abortion should become legal. They acknowledged the importance of practical, emotional, and social aspects in policy-making and emphasized that they were philosophers dealing with concepts, not legal policy.", "The authors also clarified that they did not propose that after": "birth abortion should be permissible for months or years, contrary to media reports."}
