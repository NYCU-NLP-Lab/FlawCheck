{"The claim was made by Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett during a meeting with the editorial board of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel": "where he distributed a list showing the poverty ratio between the city and suburbs in the nation's 51 largest metropolitan areas.", "The list Barrett provided came from NewGeography": "com, a website dedicated to analyzing and discussing living and working places. The data used in the list was based on the 2010 census, and it was included in an article by Wendell Cox of Demographia, a public policy firm.", "The poverty rate in Milwaukee was found to be 29": "5 percent in the city and 6.9 percent in the suburbs, resulting in a ratio of 4.3. This means that the city's poverty rate was 4.3 times higher than the suburban rate.", "The claim was supported by the fact that Milwaukee was the only large metropolitan area among the 51 analyzed that had a poverty ratio above 4": "Other metropolitan areas had lower ratios, indicating a smaller disparity between city and suburban poverty rates."}
