{"Lack of evidence": "The expert's verdict states that there is no evidence to support the claim that Barack Obama asked Ukraine to investigate Paul Manafort, Trump's former campaign manager. This lack of evidence undermines the authenticity of the claim.", "Contradictory statements": "The expert highlights that Steven Pifer, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, stated that there is nothing suggesting that Obama requested the release of information by Leshchenko, who exposed the ledger. This contradicts the claim that Obama asked Ukraine to investigate Trump's campaign manager.", "Unrelated impeachment inquiry": "The expert points out that the impeachment inquiry against President Trump was initiated due to his request to Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden, not because of any actions by Obama or the Democrats. This unrelated context undermines the claim's authenticity.", "Opinion": "based sources: The expert mentions that the spokesperson for Charlie Kirk, who made the claim, referred to opinion pieces in the Washington Post, Fox News, and The Hill. Opinion pieces are subjective and may lack factual evidence, making them less reliable in verifying the claim's authenticity."}
