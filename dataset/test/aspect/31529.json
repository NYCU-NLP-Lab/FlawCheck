{"Lack of evidence": "The expert's verdict highlights that there is no evidence to support the claim that Sayfullo Saipov used \"chain migration\" to bring 22 relatives to the United States. This lack of evidence undermines the authenticity of the claim.", "Inaccurate and baseless immigration claims": "The expert's verdict mentions that President Trump has made wildly inaccurate and baseless immigration claims about Democrats and immigration in general. This suggests that the claim about Saipov's use of \"chain migration\" may also be baseless and unreliable.", "Motivation for making the claim": "The expert's verdict states that President Trump is trying to make illegal immigration a key issue in the midterm elections. This raises questions about the motive behind the claim and whether it is being used for political gain rather than being based on factual information.", "Distorted tale": "The expert's verdict points out that President Trump has a distorted tale about Saipov's use of \"chain migration.\" This distortion suggests that the claim may be exaggerated or misrepresented, further casting doubt on its authenticity."}
