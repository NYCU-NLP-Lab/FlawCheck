{"Lack of constitutional reference": "The expert found that there was no mention of any single grade school, specifically Pease Elementary, in the Texas Constitution's education article. The constitution only states the duty of the Legislature to establish and support an efficient system of public free schools.", "Absence of Pease clauses in earlier versions": "The expert also examined earlier versions of the Texas Constitution and found no specific clauses related to Pease Elementary or any other individual school.", "Verification from district and school": "The expert reached out to the school district and directly contacted Brenda Gunn, a parent with children attending Pease Elementary. Gunn mentioned bringing a facsimile of the Texas Declaration of Independence to a meeting with the district superintendent, Meria Carstarphen, where she pointed out that education was listed as one of the grievances against the Mexican government. This anecdote suggests a historical connection but does not directly confirm the claim.", "Historical background of Pease Elementary": "The expert gathered information about the history of Pease Elementary, which was founded in 1876 and named after Elisha M. Pease, a former governor of Texas. The school's website states that it is the district's only all-transfer school, allowing students from any district location to attend. While this provides background information, it does not directly verify the claim of the school's creation being part of the Texas Constitution."}
