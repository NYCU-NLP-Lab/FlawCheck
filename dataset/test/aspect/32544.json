{"The photo was manipulated": "The expert's verdict states that the viral image claiming to show a box of Ivanka Trump brand shoes stamped with \"TARRIFF EXEMPT\" was manipulated. The photo was originally from a story on Gawker.com in 2016 about Ivanka Trump brand shoes being manufactured in China. The circulating photo is a cropped version of the original, with the \"TARRIFF EXEMPT\" stamp added.", "The word": "tariff\" is misspelled: Another aspect mentioned by the expert is that the word \"tariff\" is spelled incorrectly in the stamped text on the box. This error adds to the evidence that the image is not authentic.", "Ivanka Trump": "s fashion brand is defunct: The expert points out that Ivanka Trump announced the closure of her namesake fashion brand in July 2018, with the licensing agreement expiring later that year. Therefore, the claim of shoes from her brand being exempt from tariffs is invalid since the brand is no longer functioning.", "Shoes are not subject to new tariffs": "The expert explains that while shoes were included in a list of additional items proposed to be subject to tariffs, they are not currently affected by the tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. The increased tariffs primarily target electronics and industrial items, and shoes are not on the list of imports subject to these tariffs."}
