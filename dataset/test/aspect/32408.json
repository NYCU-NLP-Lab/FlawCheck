{"The claim specifically states that college tuition costs have risen by 25 percent under the Democrats": "The expert verifies this aspect by confirming that the average published tuition and fees for in-state students at public four-year colleges and universities did increase by slightly over 25 percent from the school-year 2008-2009 to 2011-2012.", "The expert points out the ambiguity in the translation used in the ad": "While the ad claims that \"costs have risen by 25 percent under the Democrats,\" it is unclear whether the \"costs\" referred to include only tuition or tuition plus room and board. This aspect highlights the potential misinterpretation or manipulation of the claim.", "Another aspect considered by the expert is the limitation of the tuition figure provided": "The 25 percent increase in tuition costs only applies to in-state students at public universities. The expert reveals that when data from other types of schools is taken into account, such as public two-year colleges or private four-year institutions, the percentage increase in tuition and fees is smaller than 25 percent.", "The expert also mentions the total student debt": "which the ad claims has reached a trillion dollars. Although not directly related to the 25 percent increase in tuition costs, this aspect adds context to the overall issue of college affordability and the financial burden faced by students. However, the expert does not provide a verdict on the authenticity of this specific claim."}
