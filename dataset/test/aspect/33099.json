{"The expert": "s statement: The expert, David Brooks, explicitly states that there is no correlation between primary turnout and wins in the fall in the last 11 elections. This is the main claim that is being analyzed for its authenticity.", "Data analysis": "The article mentions that the data supports Brooks' claim. It states that in the 11 presidential cycles, primary turnout did not necessarily predict general election results. It provides examples of elections where high primary turnout did not lead to a victory in the general election, as well as examples where the party with higher primary voter turnout did win the popular vote.", "Historical context": "The article highlights that primary turnout can be influenced by various factors, such as incumbency or lack of competitive contests. It mentions that in some elections, one party's nomination was locked up by incumbent presidents, leading to low primary turnout. This context is important in understanding the relationship between primary turnout and general election results.", "Comparison of primary and general election results": "The article presents specific examples where primary turnout was higher for one party, but the other party still won the general election. It cites instances where more votes in the primary did not translate into more votes in the general election. These comparisons provide evidence to support the claim that primary turnout does not necessarily determine the outcome of the general election."}
