{"The video posted on the Instagram account": "physicsfun\" showing the optical illusion in action, demonstrating the arrow appearing to always point in the same direction even when rotated 180 degrees and its reflection showing the opposite direction.", "The explanation provided by the mathematician Kokichi Sugihara in his 2016 paper for the journal Symmetry": "where he introduces the concept of \"anomalous mirror symmetry\" and describes how it can be achieved using the ambiguous cylinder illusion.", "The verification of the authenticity of the video": "confirming that it is not a result of CGI or trickery, but a real demonstration of the optical illusion.", "The scientific explanation of the illusion": "which involves a combination of reflection, perspective, and viewing angle to create the striking effect of the arrow appearing to defy the laws of optical physics."}
