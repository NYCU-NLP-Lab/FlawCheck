{"Comparison to neighboring states": "The expert's verdict mentions that Gov. Scott Walker prefers comparisons to Illinois and its budget problems and big tax hikes, rather than comparing Wisconsin to Minnesota. This indicates that the claim may not accurately reflect the comparison between Wisconsin and its neighboring state.", "Previous fact": "checking: The expert refers to a previous fact-check where a Minnesota lawmaker's claim about the state's superiority in employment, school test scores, workforce education, and other rankings relative to Wisconsin was rated as Half True. This suggests that there may be limitations or inaccuracies in making direct comparisons between the two states.", "Analysis of wage data": "The expert's verdict provides specific wage data from different sources, such as the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics and the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, to compare the average earnings per job and annual average wages in Minnesota and Wisconsin. These data points are used to verify the claim that the typical Wisconsin worker makes $5,000 less each year than their counterparts in Minnesota.", "Historical context": "The expert mentions that the wage gap between Minnesota and Wisconsin has existed since at least the 1960s and has gradually grown over time. This historical context suggests that the claim may not solely be attributable to Gov. Scott Walker's policies, as it predates his tenure as governor."}
