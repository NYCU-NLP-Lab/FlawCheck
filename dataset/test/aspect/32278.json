{"The claim is based on a study published in the British Medical Journal that divided children with cavities into three diet groups": "with Group 3 showing the greatest improvements in cavities after following a grain-free diet and taking a Vitamin D supplement.", "The study Wolfe cited was published in 1932 and focused on the influence of a cereal": "free diet rich in Vitamin D and calcium on dental caries in children. It concluded that the initiation and spread of caries were almost eliminated by these diets.", "The expert notes that the claims of": "reversing\" tooth decay were misrepresented with before-and-after photographs of a tooth, which were used to support the claim but may not accurately reflect the study's findings.", "The expert highlights that David Avocado Wolfe": "the author of the widely shared post, is an alternative health guru with questionable beliefs, which raises doubts about the credibility of the claim."}
