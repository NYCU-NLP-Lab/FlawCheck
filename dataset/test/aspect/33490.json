{"The claim is based on an article that cites former Pfizer researcher Michael Yeadon": "who left Pfizer in 2011, eight years before the start of the pandemic. This raises questions about the relevance and accuracy of his claims.", "The expert": "Dasantila Golemi-Kotra, an associate professor in microbiology at York University, explains that the Pfizer BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine, which is an mRNA vaccine, works by providing the body with instructions to synthesize a viral protein, not by introducing the virus or its proteins directly. This contradicts the claim that the vaccine causes sterilization.", "Golemi": "Kotra further clarifies that the concern over the possibility of anti-spike protein antibodies attacking the syncytin-1 protein of the placenta is very small. She explains that the immune system can recognize multiple amino acid sequences and that the spike protein of the novel coronavirus shares only a short amino acid region with the syncytin-1 protein.", "Sanjay Mishra": "a Study Coordinator at Vanderbilt University, supports this by stating that numerous publications have shown that infection with SARS-CoV-2 induces antibodies against the viral spike protein. Therefore, it can be assumed that vaccination with the viral spike protein will also direct antibodies against it, but not against the syncytin-1 protein or cause sterilization."}
