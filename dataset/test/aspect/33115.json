{"Lack of credible evidence": "The expert's verdict highlights that there is no credible evidence to support the claim that police in the UK are going to pubs and clubs to ban England jerseys because they're offensive to immigrants. The claim is based on social media posts and online forum discussions, which are not reliable sources of information.", "Inconsistent and contradictory accounts": "The expert's verdict points out that the claim originated from multiple sources, including a Facebook status update and online forum discussions. However, these sources provide contradictory accounts, with some claiming that the police are enforcing the ban and others questioning why such a ban would exist. This inconsistency raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Speculative nature of the tabloid article": "The expert's verdict highlights that the claim may have been influenced by a speculative tabloid article published in 2010. This article merely suggested that pub owners in one part of London might choose to impose a dress code temporarily banning English football jerseys to prevent potential violence. The article did not report any actual ban by the police, further undermining the credibility of the claim.", "Lack of official statements or reports": "The expert's verdict emphasizes that there are no official statements or reports from the police or any other credible sources confirming the existence of a ban on England jerseys. Without any official documentation or statements, it is difficult to verify the authenticity of the claim."}
