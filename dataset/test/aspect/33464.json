{"The claim was verified by citing a website posting about Nancy Pelosi": "the Democratic leader in the House, where she stated that Democrats will repeal the GOP tax law when they retake the House.", "Pelosi": "s statements at a town hall meeting and a news conference were examined to determine her stance on the tax reform law. She expressed willingness to work with Republicans on overhauling or overturning the law in an unspecified way.", "The expert analyzed Pelosi": "s comments about the need for a bipartisan approach to tax reform and her acknowledgment that the corporate tax rate may need to be lowered. This indicated a potential willingness to make changes to the law.", "The expert also considered Pelosi": "s previous criticism of the GOP tax reform as a \"tax scam\" that primarily benefits the rich. This suggests a motivation for Democrats to repeal or modify the law."}
