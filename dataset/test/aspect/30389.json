By looking at the percentage increase in nonfarm employment during the first 69 months after the end of each recession, the expert was able to determine the pace of job growth and compare it to the current recovery.", "Expert opinions": "The expert sought the opinions of economists, such as Tara Sinclair from George Washington University and Gary Burtless from the Brookings Institution. These experts provided their analysis and assessment of the claim, adding credibility to the verdict.", "Clarification from the White House": "The expert also considered the clarification provided by the White House regarding the claim.
