Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed ordered military intervention in Tigray, accusing the TPLF of launching a bloody attack on a federal army camp, which the TPLF denies.", "The US has expressed concerns about the conflict in Ethiopia": "and on November 17, 2020, Pompeo issued a statement condemning recent TPLF attacks. However, the expert's verdict highlights that while the US Department of State has issued various statements on the crisis, it has not publicly declared the TPLF a \"terrorist organization.\" Additionally, the TPLF does not appear on the Department of State's list of \"designated foreign terrorist organizations.\" However, it is mentioned that the TPLF was previously deemed a \"Tier III terrorist organization\" until 1991 by the US."}
