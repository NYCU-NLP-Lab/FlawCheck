{"Lack of credible citations": "The expert mentions that despite searching for the quote online, they couldn't find any credible citations for Nancy Pelosi saying, \"Just because someone is here illegally doesn\u2019t mean they broke any of our laws.\" This raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Limited sources": "The expert notes that they only found one result in the Nexis database, which was a column from a local newspaper that attributes the statement to Pelosi but lacks any context or information about when or where she said it. The limited sources available make it difficult to verify the claim.", "Incomplete context": "The expert points out that the attributions found online often lack context and sometimes suggest that Pelosi is stupid. Without the proper context of when and where the statement was made, it is challenging to determine its authenticity.", "Pelosi": "s official statements: The expert references Pelosi's official websites and statements on immigration, which do not mention the specific claim or indicate that being in the country illegally is not breaking any laws. This suggests a contradiction between the claim and Pelosi's official stance on immigration reform."}
