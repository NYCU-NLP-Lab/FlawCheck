{"Myron Ebell": "s official position and role: The expert's verdict highlights that Myron Ebell was announced by candidate Donald Trump as the leader of the transition team at the Environmental Protection Agency. Ebell currently serves as the director of the Center for Energy and Environment at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a libertarian think tank.", "Affiliation with the Cooler Heads Coalition": "Ebell chairs an initiative called the Cooler Heads Coalition, which consists of over two dozen non-profit groups that question global warming alarmism and oppose energy rationing policies. This affiliation further supports his stance as a climate change skeptic.", "Ebell": "s consistent skepticism on climate change: Ebell openly declares himself to be a climate change skeptic and disputes the severity of human activity on Earth's climate. He argues that anthropogenic global warming, if it happens at all, is a minor issue that has been used by liberals to expand the federal government. His intention is to dismantle the scientific consensus around anthropogenic global warming.", "Lack of scientific background": "Despite being frequently contacted by journalists for opposing views on scientific, peer-reviewed studies, Ebell is not actually a scientist. He holds an M.S. degree in economics from the London School of Economics. This aspect raises questions about his expertise and scientific credibility in the field of climate change."}
