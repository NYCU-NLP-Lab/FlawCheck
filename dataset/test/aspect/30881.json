{"The redistricting guidelines in the state Constitution of North Carolina were referenced by the expert to verify the claim": "These guidelines provide specific instructions on how redistricting should be carried out in the state.", "The court ruling from Stephenson vs": "Bartlett in 2002 was also cited by the expert. This ruling scolded North Carolina over maps drawn by Democrats and further emphasized the importance of compactness in creating districts.", "The expert mentioned that State Sen": "Phil Berger previously boasted about North Carolina's redistricting standards in a Senate floor speech. Although the specific details of these standards were not mentioned, it indicates that there is some basis for the claim.", "The fact that federal judges described North Carolina": "s 2011 legislative maps as \"among the largest racial gerrymanders ever encountered by a federal court\" also adds weight to the claim. This suggests that there are indeed strict anti-gerrymandering standards in place in the state."}
