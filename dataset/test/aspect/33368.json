{"The claim is supported by data from a study conducted by economist Emmanuel Saez at the University of California": "Berkeley. Saez found that in the years from 2009 to 2012, income flowing to families in the top 1 percent increased by over 30 percent, while for the rest of the population, income grew by less than half a percent.", "The claim is also supported by the statement made by Neera Tanden": "who stated that \"95 percent of the income gains in the last few years have gone to the top 1 percent.\" Tanden's statement suggests that the claim is based on accurate information and is not disputed.", "The main caveat with the data used to support the claim is that it does not include certain types of income": "such as money from government assistance programs or the value of health insurance benefits. This limitation should be taken into account when interpreting the claim.", "Alternative measures of income inequality": "such as measuring consumption rather than income, may present a different perspective on the issue. Some economists argue that looking at what people spend can provide a more accurate representation of their well-being. When viewed from this perspective, the income inequality situation may not appear as severe."}
