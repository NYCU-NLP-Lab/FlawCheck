{"Governor Mike Parson": "s announcement: The claim is verified by the statement made by Governor Mike Parson on April 27, where he stated that all Missouri businesses can open on Monday, May 4, as long as they follow the new guidelines.", "Stay": "at-home orders in St. Louis County and City: The claim is contradicted by the fact that St. Louis County and the City of St. Louis had extended stay-at-home orders in place until Monday, May 4. These orders were based on Health Commissioner Fredrick Echols' Order No. 7 and were still in effect when the governor announced the first phase of reopening.", "Power of the governor to enforce reopening": "The claim is questioned by the governor's statement in a radio interview on April 29, where he noted that he did not have the power to make counties comply with the reopening plan. He mentioned that he could only exert \"political pressure\" to encourage compliance, indicating that the reopening was not guaranteed for all businesses.", "Varied reopening dates across counties": "The claim is contradicted by the fact that Jackson County (excluding Kansas City) began reopening on May 10, which is after the mentioned date of May 4. This suggests that not all businesses in Missouri were able to open on the specified date."}
