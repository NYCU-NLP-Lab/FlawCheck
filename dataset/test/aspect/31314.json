{"The claim is based on a report shared on the Facebook page": "Punk Rock Homesteading\" that vintage Pyrex dishes contain unsafe levels of lead.", "The report cites Tamara Rubin": "the director and producer of the documentary \"MisLEAD: America's Secret Epidemic,\" who frequently tests items for lead contamination. She shows an image of a 3M Lead Check Swab after testing the outside of a Pyrex bowl.", "The report states that the milk glass interiors of vintage Pyrex commonly contain lead": "which may be released when the glass is used with highly acidic foods or when it is scratched.", "The author of the report implies that vintage Pyrex differs from its modern counterpart and suggests that lead can come into contact with food through various actions like touching": "stacking, running it through the dishwasher, or wiping it with a rag."}
