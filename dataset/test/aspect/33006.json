{"Lack of universal definition or dataset": "One aspect employed to verify the authenticity of the claim is the acknowledgment that there is no universal definition or dataset for home invasions. This means that different jurisdictions may classify such incidents differently, making it challenging to accurately track and analyze the statistics related to homicides during home invasions.", "Incomplete data from CDC and FBI": "Another aspect is the recognition that existing data sources, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Violent Death Reporting System and the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Uniform Crime Report, do not provide specific information on whether a violent death occurred during a home invasion or if the victim's own firearm was used. This limitation makes it difficult to directly verify the claim's statistics.", "Lack of recent studies": "Experts mentioned that they had not come across recent studies specifically focusing on home invasions ending in homicide or the ownership of the weapons used. This indicates a lack of rigorous analysis and up-to-date research on the topic, making it challenging to definitively validate the claim's accuracy.", "Reasonable ballpark estimate": "Despite the limitations and lack of comprehensive data, one expert mentioned that the claim's statistic of home invasion homicides comprising a minuscule 0.04 percent of all gun deaths in the United States is not wildly off base. This expert referred to the approximate number of burglary homicides in the US each year and suggested that the claim falls within a reasonable ballpark range."}
