{"Comparison of the scientific process": "The expert highlighted the difference between the scientific process involved in the development of thalidomide and the Covid-19 vaccines. They explained that the development of thalidomide occurred in an era with minimal regulatory requirements, whereas the Covid-19 vaccines underwent rigorous testing and were granted emergency use authorization by the FDA.", "Lack of evidence": "The expert mentioned that the claim lacks evidence to support the assertion that Covid-19 vaccines are unsafe like thalidomide. They emphasized that thalidomide caused severe birth defects in thousands of babies, whereas there is no scientific evidence linking the Covid-19 vaccines to such adverse effects.", "Expert opinion": "The expert cited the opinion of Dr. Susan Ellenberg, a professor of biostatistics, medical ethics, and health policy, who stated that the research around Covid-19 vaccines is significantly different from the studies conducted on thalidomide. Dr. Ellenberg highlighted the minimal regulatory requirements and small-scale trials conducted for thalidomide, contrasting them with the robust testing and regulatory processes followed for Covid-19 vaccines.", "Historical context": "The expert provided historical context by mentioning the timeline and events related to thalidomide. They explained that thalidomide was introduced in 1957, marketed in 50 countries, and later withdrawn in 1962 due to the discovery of its connection with severe birth defects. This historical context helps to differentiate the circumstances surrounding thalidomide from the development of Covid-19 vaccines."}
