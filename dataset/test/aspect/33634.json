{"Lack of corroboration": "The expert's verdict highlights that there is little in the way of corroboration for the claim. This suggests that there is a lack of evidence or supporting information to verify the authenticity of the story.", "Incomplete details": "The story lacks certain important details, such as the doctor's surname and the source of the anonymous \"reports\" cited. This raises questions about the credibility and reliability of the information presented.", "Unresponsive authorities": "The expert reached out to the magistrate assigned to the district where the incident allegedly took place, as well as the Gulf News for more details, but received no response. The lack of response from these authorities further casts doubt on the veracity of the claim.", "Expert opinions": "The expert consulted medical experts, zoos, and herpetologists to inquire about the possibility of transferring venom from one person to another through biting. The unanimous consensus among these experts was that it is not possible, labeling the claim as \"fake news.\" This expert opinion adds weight to the argument against the authenticity of the story."}
