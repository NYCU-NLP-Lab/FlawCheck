{"Lack of evidence": "The expert's verdict highlights that there is no evidence to support the claim that Mary Anne MacLeod Trump made the quoted statement about her son, Donald Trump. The meme offers no citation or credible source for the quote, and extensive online searches and news archives yielded no results supporting its authenticity.", "Newsworthiness": "The expert points out that if Mary Trump had indeed criticized her son and predicted his political disaster, it would have been considered newsworthy at the time and likely resurfaced during Donald Trump's presidential campaign in 2016. The absence of any news coverage or references to such a statement further undermines the claim's credibility.", "Timing and context": "The expert mentions that Mary Trump passed away in August 2000, while Donald Trump had already achieved wealth, celebrity status, and publicly considered running for president in the late 1990s. The supposed quote, if true, would have been relevant during these periods, yet there is no record or mention of it.", "Virality of bogus quotes": "The expert notes that there have been numerous instances of bogus quotes related to politics gaining virality on social media. This highlights the prevalence of misinformation and the need for critical evaluation and fact-checking when encountering such claims."}
