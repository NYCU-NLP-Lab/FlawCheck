{"The claim is based on the release of Brock Turner": "a sex offender, after serving only half of his jail term for sexual assault.", "The claim suggests that if Proposition 57 passes": "which allows for early parole for certain nonviolent offenders, it would result in the regular occurrence of early release for individuals convicted of similar sex crimes as Turner.", "However": "the expert clarifies that Proposition 57 applies to prison inmates, not those sentenced to jail like Turner. Therefore, the claim's assertion of regular occurrence is technically incorrect.", "The expert also highlights that Proposition 57 specifically applies to certain crimes": "including rape, sexual assault, manslaughter, assault with a deadly weapon, domestic violence, and others, similar to Turner's conviction."}
