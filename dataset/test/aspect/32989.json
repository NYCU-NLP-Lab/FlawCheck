{"Analysis of the viral photos": "The expert likely examined the two photos that were being circulated on social media, one showing a replica of Ayodhya's Ram Temple and the other showing a person offering namaz. This analysis would have involved studying the details, composition, and any potential signs of manipulation or inconsistency in the images.", "Background information on the claim": "The expert would have gathered information about the claim being made, which is that the namaz offering tableau was displayed during the Samajwadi Party's rule in Uttar Pradesh. This would have involved researching the political timeline of Uttar Pradesh, specifically during the Samajwadi Party's rule, and any relevant events or controversies related to tableau displays.", "Verification of the original source": "The expert likely conducted a reverse image search to find the original source of the namaz offering tableau photo. This would have involved using specialized tools or search engines to trace the image back to its earliest appearance online or in news articles. In this case, the expert found that the photo was actually from the 2011 Republic Day parade in Delhi and was associated with Bihar's tableau.", "Cross": "referencing with official records and reports: The expert would have consulted official records and reports related to the Republic Day parade, such as videos uploaded by Prasar Bharati and official lists of participating states and their tableau themes. By cross-referencing the information from these sources, the expert would have been able to confirm that the namaz offering tableau was indeed from Bihar in 2011 and not from Uttar Pradesh during the Samajwadi Party's rule."}
