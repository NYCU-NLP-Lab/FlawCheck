{"Scientific evidence": "The expert's verdict mentions that there is scientific evidence to suggest that manatees regulate their underwater buoyancy through flatulence. This suggests that research studies or observations have been conducted to support this claim.", "Lack of swim bladder": "Unlike fish, manatees lack a swim bladder, which is a specially designed organ that uses gas to regulate buoyancy. This indicates that manatees have a different mechanism for controlling their buoyancy, which could potentially be through flatulence.", "Observations of minimal movement": "The expert refers to a study published in The Anatomical Record that describes observations showing that manatees are able to submerge with minimal movement. This observation suggests that there may be another force, such as flatulence, at play in regulating their buoyancy.", "Comparison to human behavior": "The expert mentions that manatees fart \"just like humans do.\" This comparison suggests that manatees use flatulence as a means to regulate their buoyancy, similar to how humans release gas to adjust their body position."}
