However, it was determined that the \"unknown object\" seen in the footage was actually a rock known as Sail Rock. The expert verified that Sail Rock is a small volcano located to the southwest of Deception Island.", "The video gained attention from conspiracy theorist websites": "who claimed that the footage likely showed a kraken, a legendary sea monster of giant size. This aspect of the claim was analyzed and dismissed by the expert, who concluded that the object in question was not a sea monster but a geological formation.", "The expert cited a study published by Andean Geology in 2013": "which provided information about Sail Rock. According to the study, Sail Rock rises about 30 meters above sea level and is composed of layers of pyroclastic breccia and tuffs alternating with lava flows. This scientific information further supported the conclusion that the claim of a sea monster sighting was not authentic."}
