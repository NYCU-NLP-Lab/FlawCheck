{"The expert considered the statement made by conservative pundit Rachel Campos": "Duffy, who claimed that \"upwards of 90 percent\" of women seeking an abortion decide not to have an abortion after seeing an ultrasound. The expert found this claim to be false and lacking solid evidence.", "The expert examined a news release from the National Institute of Family and Life Advocates": "an anti-abortion group. The release described a survey conducted by the group, which found that in 75,318 cases where ultrasounds were given to \"abortion-minded\" or \"abortion-vulnerable\" women, 78 percent decided against having an abortion. However, the expert noted that the release did not provide information on follow-up to verify the long-term decision of these women.", "The expert mentioned the requirement in Wisconsin for women seeking an abortion to first get an ultrasound": "although they are not required to view it. The claim implied that if women see their ultrasound, the odds are high that they will keep the baby. The expert did not provide a specific analysis of this aspect, but it can be inferred that the claim was evaluated based on the existence of the ultrasound requirement.", "The expert": "s verdict also emphasized the lack of solid evidence to support the claim made by Laura Ingraham during an interview with Governor Scott Walker. Ingraham asked if Walker planned to move to the middle after positioning himself as a conservative in the presidential campaign. Walker responded by mentioning the ultrasound requirement and stating that if people can see the unborn child, the odds are high they will keep the baby. The expert's verdict indicates that there was no evidence to support this claim."}
