{"Different ways of measuring dropout rates": "The expert highlights that there are various methods used to measure how many students leave school before graduating. This includes tracking individual students from freshman year to graduation or calculating the decline in enrollment between freshman year and graduation. The expert emphasizes that the choice of measurement method can affect the accuracy of the dropout rate statistic.", "Imperfect measurement": "The expert acknowledges that the dropout rate statistic is an imperfect measurement. Education experts caution that it may not accurately distinguish between students who dropped out and those who left for other reasons, such as moving to another school or following their parents. This suggests that the claim's authenticity may be questionable due to the limitations of the measurement itself.", "Lack of consistent calculation across states": "The expert mentions that each state may have its own way of calculating dropout rates. This lack of consistency in calculation methods further adds to the complexity and potential inaccuracy of the dropout rate statistic. It implies that comparing dropout rates across states may not provide a reliable measure of the claim's authenticity.", "Effort required for accurate measurement": "The expert notes that tracking individual students from freshman year to graduation provides the most accurate data on dropout rates. However, this method requires significant effort, and many school districts may not have the resources or capacity to implement it. This limitation suggests that the available data may not fully capture the actual dropout rate, casting doubt on the claim's authenticity."}
