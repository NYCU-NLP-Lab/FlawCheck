He warned of dire tax consequences if any of the three main Democratic candidates for the gubernatorial race win, stating that they have all said \"the answer to our problems is a massive income tax hike.\"", "Candidates": "support for progressive tax: The expert's verdict mentions that all three Democratic candidates, Daniel Biss, Chris Kennedy, and JB Pritzker, have expressed support for replacing Illinois' flat-rate income tax with a system where higher-income individuals pay higher rates. This indicates a willingness to implement a progressive tax structure.", "Constitutional amendment requirement": "The expert's verdict highlights that implementing a progressive tax system would require amending the Illinois Constitution, as the current flat-rate income tax is enshrined in the constitution. This amendment would need to be approved by three-fifths majorities in both the Illinois House and Senate and then by voters in a general election.", "Historical challenges in passing tax referendums": "The expert's verdict mentions that from 2013 to 2017, Democrats held three-fifths majorities in both the House and Senate but were unable to gather enough votes to back ballot referendums on a limited graduated income tax plan. This suggests that passing a progressive tax system in Illinois has been challenging in the past."}
