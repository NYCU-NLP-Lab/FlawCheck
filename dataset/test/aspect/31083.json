{"The claim was verified by checking the exit poll data for the 2008 election": "specifically looking at how voters from union households voted. The data showed that 39 percent of voters from union households voted for Republican nominee John McCain.", "The expert also compared the voting patterns of union members themselves": "which showed that 60 percent of union members voted for Democrat Barack Obama and 37 percent voted for McCain. This data confirmed that a significant portion of union members did vote Republican in 2008.", "The expert mentioned the statement made by Bill Kristol": "the editor of the conservative magazine The Weekly Standard, on Fox News Sunday. Kristol stated that he believed 40 percent of union members voted Republican in 2008. This statement prompted the investigation into the claim's authenticity.", "The expert acknowledged a minor caveat in the data": "noting that there were slight differences between how voters from union households voted and how union members themselves voted. However, these differences were only two points less for McCain among union members, confirming that a substantial number of union members did indeed vote Republican in 2008."}
