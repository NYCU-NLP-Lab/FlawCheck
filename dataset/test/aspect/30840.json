{"The video footage shows protesters entering a building known as the Kamuzu Mausoleum": "which is the final resting place of Malawi's founding president, Hastings Kamuzu Banda. This building is several kilometers away from the Malawi State House where President Mutharika is based.", "Multiple versions of the misleading Facebook post can be found": "indicating that the claim may have been exaggerated or misrepresented. Additionally, a Zimbabwean newspaper incorrectly located the protest at Mutharika's residence in a now-deleted tweet.", "The presence of a loud voice in the video can be heard mentioning the name of Hastings Kamuzu Banda": "indicating that the protesters may be expressing their grievances towards President Mutharika.", "Comparison with photos published on a travel blog and screenshots from the video reveal several consistent features": "including three pillars on the right side of the building, a portrait of the late Banda over the entrance, and the design of the railings leading up the stairs. These features confirm that the protest took place at the Kamuzu Mausoleum and not at the Malawi State House."}
