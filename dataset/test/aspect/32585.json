{"U": "S. Sen. Kamala Harris has made equal pay a centerpiece of her Democratic campaign for president.", "Harris unveiled a plan to require employers to disclose pay data": "under penalty of being fined if they fall short of paying their workers equally, regardless of gender.", "Harris stated on CBS": "s \"Late Show with Stephen Colbert\" that women on average are paid 80 cents on the dollar of what men are paid for the same work. She also mentioned the pay gaps for African American women (61 cents) and Latinas (53 cents).", "The expert": "s verdict highlights that the 80 percent figure does not accurately represent an apples-to-apples comparison of men and women performing the same work. It refers to the average pay for all jobs held by men and all jobs held by women. The figure does not adjust for factors such as degrees, job choices, time taken off for childcare, hours worked, and years of experience."}
