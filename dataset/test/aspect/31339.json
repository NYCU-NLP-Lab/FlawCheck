{"Expert opinion": "The expert, Paul C. \"Chip\" Knappenberger, assistant director of the Center for the Study of Science at the Cato Institute, stated that the effects of greenhouse gases on climate change are scientifically proven. This expert opinion supports the claim that greenhouse gases are a problem.", "Fresh research": "Knappenberger also mentioned articles he wrote suggesting that recent research indicates the generally predicted pace of warming may be overstated. This suggests that there is some uncertainty regarding the extent of the problem posed by greenhouse gas emissions.", "Scientific consensus": "Multiple experts, including the Texas state climatologist, John Nielsen-Gammon, and Naomi Oreskes, a professor of history at the University of California, San Diego, confirmed that there is a scientific consensus that increasing greenhouse gas emissions are contributing to global warming. This consensus supports the claim that greenhouse gases are a problem.", "Uncertain pace of warming": "Knappenberger also mentioned that the pace of global warming is uncertain and that the magnitude of the problem depends on how fast and how large the climate change is that results. This indicates that there is some variability in the severity of the problem posed by greenhouse gas emissions."}
