{"Multiple sources": "The expert noted that the claim was supported by a series of images that were allegedly taken by several different people. This suggests that the authenticity of the claim was being verified by the presence of multiple sources or witnesses.", "Matching details": "The expert pointed out that although the photographs were taken in different locations (Memphis and Benguela), the UFO and the surrounding cloud formations were exactly the same in each photograph. This observation raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim and suggests that the images may have been manipulated or created using the same stock image.", "Fan art connection": "The expert discovered that the series of photographs were actually created using a piece of fan art related to the V science fiction television series. This connection to a fictional source raises further doubts about the authenticity of the claim and suggests that the images were not genuine evidence of a UFO sighting.", "Artist": "s admission: The expert found a statement from the digital artist, Jukka Korhonen, who created the fan art used in the photographs. Korhonen admitted that the image was not official art for the series and was created as a concept work for a potential sequel-series that was never realized. This admission further undermines the authenticity of the claim and confirms that the photographs were not genuine evidence of a UFO sighting."}
