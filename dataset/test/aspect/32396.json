{"Testimony from a political expert": "The expert, Fergus Cullen, who ran the New Hampshire Republican Party from 2007-08, stated that stories about voters coming over from Massachusetts are as old as \"the invention of the bus.\" This expert opinion provides historical context and suggests that the claim may not be unique or recent.", "Lack of evidence provided by the White House": "The White House did not provide any evidence to support the claim of busing voters into New Hampshire. This absence of evidence raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Same": "day voter registration law in New Hampshire: New Hampshire has a same-day voter registration law, which allows individuals to register and vote on the same day. While this law provides an opportunity for out-of-state individuals to vote, they would have to sign affidavits and risk legal penalties if they voted in more than one place or state. This aspect suggests that the claim may be possible but with significant risks and consequences for those involved.", "Historical recurrence of similar claims": "The expert mentioned that a similar theory was circulating in New Hampshire during the 2012 election, where Massachusetts Democrats were supporting Elizabeth Warren against incumbent Sen. Scott Brown. This aspect highlights a pattern of similar claims being made in the past, which raises questions about the credibility and validity of the current claim."}
