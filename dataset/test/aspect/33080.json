{"The publication date and social media sharing of the photo collage": "The expert's verdict mentions that the photo collage was published on Facebook on May 27, 2019, and had been shared over 900 times. This information helps establish the timeline and popularity of the claim.", "The misleading caption and translation": "The expert's verdict provides the translation of the Hindi caption accompanying the photos, which claims that a large number of people are protesting against electronic voting machines (EVMs) in Surat without political backing. This information highlights the specific claim being made and its potential impact.", "Previous circulation of the photos": "The expert's verdict reveals that the same photo collage had been shared on Facebook and Twitter before with a similar claim. It is then clarified that the photos had actually been circulating online since at least 2017 in reports about protests against alleged EVM tampering in different Indian cities. This information undermines the authenticity of the claim.", "Reverse image search and comparison": "The expert's verdict mentions conducting a reverse image search on Google to find the original sources of the photos. The search results lead to reports published in Outlook India magazine in 2017 and Scroll.in in 2018, both of which feature the same photos with different contexts. The comparison between the misleading posts and the original sources helps establish the misrepresentation of the claim."}
