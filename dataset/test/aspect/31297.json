{"The claim made by Chris Jacobs is a common tactic used by upstate Republicans running for state office": "which is to link rival Democrats to New York City and promise to stand against the liberal base.", "Jacobs specifically states that Buffalo does not receive its fair share from the state": "implying that New York City benefits more from the taxes paid by hardworking individuals.", "Data from the state Department of Budget shows that Western New York counties": "including Erie County, contribute a smaller percentage of total taxes collected by the state compared to New York City.", "The Department of Budget also provides data showing that the state spends less in Western New York than it receives in taxes in major spending categories such as education": "economic development, roads, and human services. However, it is worth noting that Western New York did receive a significant portion of the state's economic development spending between 2012 and 2016."}
