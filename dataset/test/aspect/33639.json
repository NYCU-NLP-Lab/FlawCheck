{"The claim is supported by a report published by the Department of Veterans Affairs": "Office for Suicide Prevention in 2016, which found that an average of 20 veterans died by suicide each day in 2014. This report provides statistical evidence to back up the claim.", "The claim is also supported by a 2018 update by the Department of Veterans Affairs": "which confirmed that the average number of veteran suicides per day remained unchanged at 20. This recent update further strengthens the credibility of the claim.", "The director of Injury Control Research at West Virginia University": "Robert Bossarte, who helped author the VA's 2016 report, considers the 20-a-day figure to be accurate. This expert endorsement adds another layer of verification to the claim.", "The claim is consistent with the goal of a veterans mental health and suicide prevention bill introduced by Senator Joe Manchin": "who cited the figure of more than 20 veterans dying by suicide every day in a press release. This legislative context provides additional support for the claim."}
