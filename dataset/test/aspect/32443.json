{"Unofficial election results": "The expert points out that the unofficial results from the Alabama Senate race show that Doug Jones defeated Roy Moore by a margin of about 20,000 votes. This contradicts the claim that Jones received more than 5,000 votes in a town with a population of 2,256.", "Source credibility": "The expert highlights that the claim originated from a website called Ladies of Liberty, which describes itself as a platform for conservative satire. The website's About page clearly states that everything on the site is fiction, indicating that the claim is not based on real events.", "Inconsistent board name": "The expert mentions that the claim references the \"State Election Board of Voting Integrity,\" which is a variation of the \"State Election Integrity Board\" mentioned in other fake news items. The Alabama Secretary of State has confirmed that no such board exists, casting doubt on the claim's authenticity.", "Nonexistent location": "The expert points out that the claim mentions a small town called Bordalama, which does not appear on the U.S. Census' list of places in Alabama. This lack of evidence for the town's existence further discredits the claim."}
