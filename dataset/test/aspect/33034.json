{"The image was not taken in Iran": "The expert's verdict states that the image was not captured in Iran but in Cali, Colombia, in July 2003. This is confirmed through a reverse-image search of the photograph.", "The image does not depict a woman about to be stoned to death": "The expert's verdict clarifies that the image is part of a series taken during a protest in Colombia, where individuals voluntarily buried themselves up to their necks to protest the government's failure to relocate displaced people. The image has no connection to Iran, Islam, or stoning.", "The photo is real but the message is misleading": "While the image itself is authentic, the expert's verdict highlights that the caption and message accompanying the image are false. The caption falsely suggests that the woman in the image is about to be stoned to death in Iran under Sharia Law.", "Verification through multiple sources": "The expert's verdict provides a list of sources that have debunked the claim, including TinEye (a reverse-image search), Getty Images, Adobe stock images, Hoax-alert.LeadStories, FactCheck AFP, and New Yorker. These sources further support the authenticity of the expert's verdict."}
