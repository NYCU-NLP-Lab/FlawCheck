{"The claim is based on a statement made by U": "S. Rep. Lamar Smith, stating that illegal immigrants currently occupy 8 million jobs in the United States.", "The claim is supported by a report from the Pew Hispanic Center": "a reputable research organization, which estimated that there were 7.8 million undocumented workers in the United States in April 2009.", "The data used to estimate the number of undocumented workers is from March 2008": "which is more than 20 months old and may not accurately reflect the current situation.", "The economic conditions have changed since the data was collected": "with millions of people, including undocumented immigrants, losing their jobs. Therefore, it is unclear if the claim of 8 million jobs occupied by illegal immigrants is still accurate."}
