{"The claim is based on comments made by Bloomberg in a 2012 TV interview": "which were in response to questions about how to determine which weapons would be subject to restrictions.", "In the interview": "Bloomberg expressed a desire to limit how quickly a gun can fire rounds and the number of rounds a gun can carry, but he did not explicitly state that he supported a limit of three rounds.", "Bloomberg has publicly endorsed a ban on": "military-style assault weapons\" and \"high-capacity ammunition magazines,\" but there is no specific mention of a ban on guns holding more than three rounds in his official policy statements in 2020.", "The recent Facebook post that claims Bloomberg wants to ban guns holding more than three rounds uses the present tense to describe his proposal": "but it fails to provide any recent or concrete evidence to support this claim."}
