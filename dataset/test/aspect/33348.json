{"Comparison with previous NASA photos": "The expert compared the image in question with previous photos taken by NASA's Mars rovers. The comparison revealed that the image in the Facebook post did not resemble any of the authentic photos taken by NASA.", "Analysis of image quality": "The expert noted that the image in the Facebook post appeared to be much crisper and more detailed than the actual photos taken from Mars. This raised suspicions about its authenticity.", "Search for similar images": "A search on NASA's website for images, videos, and audio related to Mars, Earth, Venus, and Jupiter yielded 15 results, but none of them matched the image in the Facebook post. This lack of similar images further cast doubts on the claim's authenticity.", "Identification of software markers": "The expert noticed the presence of letters \"NE\" in the bottom left corner of the image, which are commonly used as markers in planetarium software to indicate the direction a user is looking. This suggested that the image was likely a computer-generated representation rather than an actual photograph."}
