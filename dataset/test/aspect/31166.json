This data showed that the state paid, on average, $22,034 to retired state workers or their beneficiaries and $14,028 to retired local workers.", "The expert examined more recent data to determine if the average payments made by the state under PERS remained consistent over time": "The more recent data showed similar average payments, supporting the claim made by the union leader, Hetty Rosenstein.", "The expert acknowledged that pension amounts vary depending on a worker": "s salary and years of service. This suggests that the average pension amounts provided by Rosenstein may not apply to all public workers, but rather represent an average across the entire group.", "The expert highlighted that there are different ways to measure average pensions": "and Rosenstein's claim was based on the average payments made by the state.
