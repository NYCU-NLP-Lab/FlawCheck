{"The claim was verified by analyzing the state": "s ranking on long-term unemployment. It was found that Florida was indeed ranked 2nd in the nation in long-term unemployment, as stated in the claim.", "The analysis was based on data from the U": "S. Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics, specifically the monthly data on the share of those unemployed for at least 27 weeks in each state.", "The claim was supported by a report from the Economic Policy Institute": "EPI), a liberal think tank, which calculated that 46.2 percent of laid-off Floridians were out of work for at least six months in 2013.", "However": "it was noted by economists that there are different ways to measure long-term unemployment. Some economists argued that looking at the percentage of the labor force that is long-term unemployed, rather than just the percent of the unemployed, would result in different rankings. When considering this alternative measure, Florida was found to be ranked 11th in 2013."}
