{"Lack of evidence": "The expert's verdict states that the claim of a substantial number of votes being fraudulently cast by \"dead people\" in Pennsylvania is made without providing any evidence to support it. This lack of evidence raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Rare occurrence": "Election experts mention that while there have been occasional instances of votes cast by deceased individuals, it is exceedingly rare. Most often, such cases involve votes cast by a spouse. This rarity indicates that the impact of such occurrences would be minimal and unlikely to affect the outcome of a close race like the one in Pennsylvania.", "Limited scope of investigation": "Senator Lindsey Graham claimed that the Trump campaign had evidence of dead people voting in Pennsylvania. However, the expert's verdict highlights that the campaign's investigation was limited to early voters and absentee mail-in ballots. This limited scope raises questions about the validity and comprehensiveness of the evidence presented.", "Common causes of mistaken claims": "The expert explains that claims of dead people voting are often overblown after elections. These claims can often be attributed to list-matching or clerical problems, such as confusing two individuals with similar or identical names. This explanation suggests that mistaken claims about deceased individuals voting can be due to administrative errors rather than fraudulent activities."}
