Hurt's claim of non-defense discretionary spending increasing \"by over 80 percent in the last two years\" is based on comparing the original $434 billion to the new total of $796 billion (including the stimulus money), resulting in an 83.4 percent increase. This highlights the specific calculation used to arrive at the claimed percentage increase.", "Omission of stimulus money": "The expert criticizes Rep.
