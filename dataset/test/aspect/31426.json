This suggests that it was a common occurrence and provides background information to support the claim.", "The Affordable Care Act": "The expert mentions that the 2010 health care law passed by the Democratic Congress and signed by Obama addressed the issue of coverage being dropped or capped when illness strikes. The law prohibits lifetime limits on coverage and rescinding coverage except in cases of fraud.", "Higher threshold for proving fraud": "The expert states that the new law sets a higher threshold for companies to prove fraud, making it harder for them to drop or cap coverage.
