{"Donald Trump": "s comments and gestures: The expert's verdict highlights Trump's comments and gestures during a campaign rally where he discussed New York Times reporter Serge Kovaleski. Trump flailed his arms, with his right hand flopping at an odd angle, and shouted in a weird, agitated voice, which many observers interpreted as mocking Kovaleski's disability.", "The New York Times rebuke": "The New York Times issued a statement rebuking Trump for his comments and actions towards their reporter. They expressed outrage that he would ridicule the appearance of one of their reporters, indicating that they perceived it as mocking Kovaleski's disability.", "Social media campaign": "People who share Kovaleski's condition, known as arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC), and their families launched a social media campaign with the hashtag \"AMCStrong.\" This campaign aimed to raise awareness about the impact of Trump's actions and to challenge the portrayal of disabled individuals as incompetent.", "Expert opinion": "Julie Reiskin, the executive director of the Colorado Cross-Disability Coalition, an advocacy group, provided her expert opinion on the matter. She stated that Trump's behavior clearly mocked Kovaleski's disability and portrayed people with disabilities as incompetent. Reiskin's expertise adds weight to the argument that Trump's actions were inappropriate and potentially harmful to disabled individuals."}
