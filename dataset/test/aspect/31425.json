{"Discrepancy in the name": "The fact that the girl is named as \"Maryam\" in the photo collage and \"my sister Marian\" in the text of the post raises doubts about the accuracy of the claim.", "Comments from readers": "The comments posted below the photos indicate that many readers believe the little girl was beaten to death by her teacher, showing a tendency to accept the claim as true without verifying the information.", "Reverse image search results": "Conducting a simple reverse image search on Google led to articles about a different incident involving a little girl who was injured during a sledding outing in Chicago in January 2018. This suggests that the photos used in the misleading Facebook post were unrelated to the claim.", "Confirmation from the girl": "s mother: Contacting Monica Jefferson, the girl's mother mentioned in the original Facebook post, confirmed that her daughter Maya is alive and well, about to start the fourth grade. This direct confirmation from a reliable source further discredits the claim of the little girl being beaten to death."}
