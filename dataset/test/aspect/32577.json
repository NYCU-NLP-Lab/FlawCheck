{"Lack of credible sources": "The expert's verdict highlights that there are no legitimate media reports or credible sources that mention any doctor named \"Mujahid Hussain\" being fired from the AYUSH Ministry for halting the advertisement and sale of Coronil. This lack of credible sources raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Contradictory statements by the Ministry of AYUSH": "The Ministry of AYUSH issued a statement clarifying that they have not removed any doctor or medical officer from duty or service in the recent past. This contradictory statement further questions the validity of the claim.", "Inconsistencies in social media posts": "The claim originated from tweets by VHP spokesperson Vijay Shankar Tiwari and an impersonated Twitter account of journalist Pushpendra Kulshreshtha. However, these posts were later deleted, suggesting a lack of credibility and potentially raising suspicions about the claim's authenticity.", "Lack of scientific evidence": "The expert's verdict mentions that Patanjali Ayurved submitted reports to prove the efficacy of Coronil, but a sci-check by Alt News concluded that none of the scientific proofs provided by the company suggest that Coronil is an effective treatment for Covid-19. This lack of scientific evidence undermines the credibility of the claim."}
