{"The claim was first reported by a website called Viral Time Lapse": "which has a history of publishing false articles and clickbait.", "The claim was spread through a Facebook page where fans were asked to show their condolences by commenting and liking the page": "which is an unusual and crass request in the event of someone's death.", "Tommy Chong himself": "through his social media accounts, has been actively posting and referencing events that occurred after the supposed date of his passing, such as the launch of his website and his participation in conferences. This contradicts the claim of his death.", "The actor was diagnosed with rectal cancer in 2015 and underwent an operation to treat it": "which is a true fact. However, this does not confirm his death in February 2017 as claimed."}
