{"Mike Martinez": "s statement: Austin mayoral candidate Mike Martinez claimed that his opponent, Steve Adler, lacks experience in municipal matters and has never been active in anything related to City Hall. This statement serves as the basis for the claim being investigated.", "Lack of active role in local government": "Martinez's spokesperson, Nick Hudson, stated that Adler has not taken an active role in local government by appearing before the Council on any item. This suggests that Adler has not participated in the decision-making processes or discussions at City Hall.", "Absence from council": "appointed boards or commissions: Adler's campaign manager, Jim Wick, confirmed that Adler has never been on a council-appointed board or commission. This further supports the claim that Adler has not been actively involved in City Hall affairs.", "Involvement in city": "related causes: Wick mentioned that Adler has volunteered in causes connected with city government. Specifically, Adler led the board of the Austin-area Anti-Defamation League and served on the city-led Hate Crimes Task Force. This indicates that Adler has engaged with issues that intersect with city government, albeit in a different capacity than being directly involved with City Hall."}
