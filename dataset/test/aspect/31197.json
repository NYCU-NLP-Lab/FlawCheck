{"Lack of credible sources": "The expert found no record of President Ronald Reagan ever making such a statement in any public forum. They reached out to the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and confirmed that there was no source for this quote in their research of Reagan's public speeches and open papers.", "Inconsistent with Reagan": "s character: The expert, along with the Chief Administrative Officer for the Reagan Foundation, stated that the alleged statement does not sound like something President Reagan would say. They emphasized Reagan's civility and respect for others in public office, which contradicts the derogatory nature of the claim.", "Flawed understanding and questionable origin": "The claim was initially made in an Instagram post that displayed a flawed understanding of constitutional power and contained hashtags associated with the QAnon conspiracy theory. The post has been shared by numerous accounts promoting this conspiracy theory, raising doubts about its credibility and origin.", "Cordial relations between the Pelosi and Reagan families": "The expert highlighted the cordial relations between the Pelosi and Reagan families, as demonstrated by Nancy Pelosi's positive remarks about President Reagan's civility. This further undermines the authenticity of the claim, as it is unlikely that Reagan would have made such a derogatory statement about someone he had cordial relations with."}
