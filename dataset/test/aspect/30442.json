{"The claim is supported by a 2011 audit by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration": "which found that individuals who are not authorized to work in the United States were paid $4.2 billion in refundable credits in 2009.", "Undocumented immigrants can file taxes using an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number": "ITIN), which is a nine-digit number different from a Social Security Number. Experts state that the majority of ITIN filers are illegal immigrants, although the exact number is unknown.", "ITIN filers": "regardless of immigration status, are not eligible for Social Security benefits. Undocumented immigrants have paid an estimated $12 billion in payroll taxes but will not receive the benefits.", "While ITIN filers cannot receive the Earned Income Tax Credit due to a provision in a 1996 law": "they can receive the Additional Child Tax Credit, a refund given to people who owed less in taxes than deductions they could receive through the Child Tax Credit."}
