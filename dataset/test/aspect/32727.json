{"The expert": "s verdict highlights that Mick Mulvaney, the White House Office of Management and Budget Director, made an apples-to-oranges comparison by equating the Democrats' opposition to supplemental funding for a border wall with their support for the Secure Fence Act of 2006.", "The Secure Fence Act of 2006 called for the construction of 700 miles of fencing and enhanced surveillance technology": "such as unmanned drones, ground-based sensors, satellites, radar coverage, and cameras. It was supported by a bipartisan majority, including Sen. Chuck Schumer, then-Sens. Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, and signed into law by President George W. Bush.", "The comparison made by Mulvaney overlooks the fact that the Democrats supported a bill to build more border fencing in 2006": "while President Trump is now requesting funds to build a wall and fencing.", "Mulvaney": "s statement about Democrats opposing the border wall and holding national security hostage is seen as a concern and a potential indication of a pattern of opposition to President Trump's initiatives, similar to their opposition to the nomination of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court."}
