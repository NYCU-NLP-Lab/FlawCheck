{"Confirmation from Lufthansa spokesperson": "A Lufthansa spokesperson confirmed via email that the video was not a real-life scenario, indicating that the claim of a bumpy landing was false.", "Analysis of video using InVID": "An analysis of keyframes extracted from the video using the video verification tool InVID revealed that the clip consisted of computer-generated imagery, further supporting the conclusion that it was not an authentic event.", "Lack of realistic damage": "The video showed the Lufthansa flight's engines sinking into the ground upon contact without any visible damage to the runway or the aircraft. This unrealistic outcome suggested that it was not a real-life incident.", "Flight simulation program evidence": "Experts, including Pete Wright and Marty Arant, identified that the video appeared to have been created using flight simulation programs such as Microsoft FSX and X-Plane 11. These programs allow for settings that ignore collisions, prevent detachment of aircraft parts, and eliminate the presence of fire or debris, which further indicated that the video was not depicting a genuine event."}
