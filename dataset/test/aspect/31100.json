{"Media reports": "Several national and international media outlets, including Daily Mail, The Sun, WION, and India Times, published reports linking the increase in sulfur dioxide levels in Wuhan and Chongqing to mass cremation of coronavirus victims. These reports cited a screenshot from windy.com as the primary source of evidence.", "Social media posts": "Twitter accounts, such as @inteldotwav and @livecrisisnews, shared the same screenshot from windy.com, claiming that the release of sulfur dioxide gas in Wuhan was associated with the burning of organic matter. These posts received significant attention and were retweeted thousands of times.", "Lack of evidence": "The media reports acknowledged that the increase in SO2 levels could indicate mass cremations, but they did not provide concrete evidence to support this claim. They also mentioned that the high SO2 levels could be attributed to other factors such as the burning of fossil fuels and industrial activities.", "Expert analysis": "Raj Bhagat Palanichamy, a remote sensing expert at World Resources Institute, India, stated that the images shared as satellite images were not actual satellite images but rather results of the GEOS-5 Model visualized and shared by windy.com. He explained that the forecasted levels of SO2 shown in the images were based on emission inventories and did not include live observations. Palanichamy emphasized that short-term changes in artificial pollutant sources would not influence the model's outcome."}
