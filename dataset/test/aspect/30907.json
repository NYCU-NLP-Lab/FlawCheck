{"Inconsistency in language used by Joe Malcoun in the ad": "which could be interpreted as implying that his personal financial well-being was at stake in the survival of his bar, despite having other business interests and inherited wealth.", "Lack of unambiguous statement by Malcoun in the ad regarding the potential loss of his income if his bar went under": "3. Right-leaning outlets did not \"reveal\" Malcoun's other business interests and his family's inherited wealth, as they were already a matter of public record for years.", "The Biden campaign stated that they pulled the ad due to threats and harassment faced by Malcoun and his family": "not because they were supposedly \"caught\" in a lie."}
