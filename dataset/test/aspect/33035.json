{"Lack of evidence": "The expert's verdict highlights that there is no evidence to support the claim that millions of illegal immigrants crossed the borders and voted in the past election. This lack of evidence undermines the authenticity of the claim.", "Contradictory statements": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim made by Lou Dobbs on Fox Business Network contradicts the information provided by the Department of Homeland Security. The DHS figures show a much lower number of border crossings, indicating that Dobbs' claim is exaggerated.", "Expert opinion": "The expert quotes David Becker, the executive director of the Center for Election Innovation & Research, who states that there is zero evidence of even dozens, let alone millions, of non-citizens voting in any election. This expert opinion further discredits the claim.", "Lack of response from Fox News": "The expert mentions that Fox News did not respond to their request for comment on the claim. The lack of response raises questions about the credibility of the claim and the willingness of Fox News to address the issue."}
