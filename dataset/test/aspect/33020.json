{"Lack of statewide data": "The expert's verdict highlights that there is no statewide data available to support the claim that more ex-felons have registered as Republicans than Democrats in Florida since the new law took effect. This lack of data makes it difficult to verify the authenticity of the claim.", "Inconclusive interviews": "The expert conducted interviews with election officials, professors, and advocates for Amendment 4, but none of them were able to provide any statewide data or evidence showing the partisan breakdown of newly registered ex-felons. This suggests that there is no concrete evidence to support the claim.", "Limited information on voter registration forms": "The voter registration application in Florida does not provide a way to differentiate between ex-felons whose voting rights have been restored and those who were never felons. This limitation makes it challenging to accurately determine the partisan affiliation of registered ex-felons.", "Possible misinterpretation of a news report": "The expert mentions that there was speculation about whether Jared Kushner was referring to an NBC report that discussed felon voter registration in Florida. However, the report only provided data for the top 10 counties and did not offer a comprehensive analysis of the partisan breakdown. This ambiguity further adds to the difficulty of verifying the claim."}
