{"Lack of real": "world evidence: The expert's verdict states that no real-world evidence has been found to support the claim that Queen Elizabeth has suspended or threatened to suspend Prince Harry's wedding due to Meghan Markle's public comments.", "Unreliable sources": "The claim is based on anonymous sources and reports from unreliable websites, such as YourNewsWire. These sources are not considered credible or trustworthy.", "Inaccurate information": "The expert's verdict highlights the inaccuracies in the claim, such as the assertion that Meghan Markle has made recent public statements spreading divisive ideology. It is stated that Markle has not tweeted since March 2017 and has not made any recent statements that can be interpreted as such.", "Acceptance into the royal family": "The fact that Meghan Markle was invited to the queen's Christmas festivities in 2017, which is a privilege usually reserved for those who have already married into the royal family, suggests that she has already been accepted by the royal family. This contradicts the claim that the wedding has been suspended or threatened to be suspended."}
