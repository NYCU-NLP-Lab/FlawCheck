{"Lack of credible sources or evidence": "The expert mentions that the original claim made on Facebook by David Zublick, a conservative news personality, contains no sources or evidence to support the assertion that Sen. Elizabeth Warren has been on Risperdal since 2011.", "Inconsistent or removed social media posts": "The expert highlights that a tweet with identical wording to Zublick's post was shared on Twitter but has since been removed. This raises questions about the reliability and veracity of the claim.", "Limited mentions on social media": "The expert states that apart from Zublick's post and the removed tweet, there is only one other mention on Twitter linking Warren to the drug. This suggests a lack of widespread discussion or evidence supporting the claim.", "Trump": "s comments and campaign response: The expert mentions that President Donald Trump made a comment about Warren's psychiatrist in a Fox News interview. While this may not directly verify the claim, it adds an interesting context to the discussion about Warren's psychiatric health.
