{"Lack of record": "The expert notes that there is no record of Mahatma Gandhi ever saying the famous quote. This suggests that there is no direct evidence linking him to these exact words.", "Attribution by high": "profile politicians: The expert mentions that several high-profile politicians have attributed the quote to Gandhi. However, they were unable to find any credible source directly connecting Gandhi to these words. This raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Paraphrasing from Gandhi": "s writings: The expert highlights that the quote appears to be a paraphrase from Gandhi's book \"Freedom's Battle.\" Gandhi wrote about introducing his form of nonviolent protest, which he called satyagraha. While this suggests a similarity in ideas, it does not confirm that Gandhi specifically said the quote in question.", "Alternative source with similar wording": "The expert mentions a speech by union leader Nicholas Klein in 1914 that provides a closer version of the misattributed quote. This suggests that the quote may have originated from a different source altogether, further casting doubt on its authenticity as Gandhi's words."}
