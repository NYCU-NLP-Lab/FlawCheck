{"Lack of international news reporting": "The expert points out that if Tom Hanks had been arrested for such a shocking charge, it would have been international news. The fact that there is no news reporting about it suggests that the claim is a spurious rumor.", "Inconsistent timeline and location": "The expert highlights that photographs of Tom Hanks wearing a green T-shirt and green bandana, which are part of the claim, were taken in Los Angeles in May 2020. This contradicts the claim that he was in custody in Australia at that time. Additionally, more recent photographs of Hanks in June and July 2020 show him not wearing an ankle bracelet, further undermining the claim.", "Lack of convincing evidence": "The expert mentions that other photographs from the same time and place do not provide any convincing evidence of Tom Hanks wearing an ankle bracelet. This casts doubt on the claim's credibility.", "Reputable sources debunking conspiracy theories": "The expert references reputable sources such as The Guardian, Snopes.com, and The Washington Post, which have debunked similar conspiracy theories involving Tom Hanks and other celebrities. This suggests that the claim is part of a larger pattern of baseless allegations."}
