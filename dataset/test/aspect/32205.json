{"Lack of credible source": "The expert's verdict mentions that there is no credible source or evidence to support the claim of BJP MLA Anil Upadhyay torturing a man.

This inconsistency raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Verification through media reports": "The expert's verdict mentions that mainstream media outlets reported on the incident, stating that it took place in Maharashtra and involved individuals named Vicky Aglawe, Akhil Pohankar, and Omprakash Choure. These media reports provide a verifiable source of information that contradicts the claim made in the video.", "Background information": "The expert's verdict provides background information about the incident, including the reason behind the torture and the individuals involved. This additional information helps in understanding the context and verifying the authenticity of the claim."}
