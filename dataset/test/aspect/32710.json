{"The claim is based on fear": "mongering and misinformation: The expert points out that the fear surrounding Tamiflu is part of a larger trend of influenza-based fear-mongering. This suggests that the claim may not be based on reliable or accurate information.", "The claim relies on a misinterpretation of the medication": "s safety insert: The user highlights a warning about \"change in behavior\" in the Tamiflu safety insert, specifically focusing on the word \"death.\" However, the expert explains that this warning is not unique to Tamiflu and that deaths related to behavioral changes are mainly caused by dangerous or self-destructive behavior, not flu symptoms.", "Lack of credible evidence supporting the claim": "The expert states that the claim that Tamiflu is responsible for the increased number of deaths is unsupported by any credible evidence. They highlight that the symptoms associated with the claimed behavioral changes would be obvious to medical professionals, making it unlikely for Tamiflu to be the cause.", "Majority of influenza deaths are due to the flu itself": "The expert mentions that a majority of influenza deaths during the 2017-2018 flu season are actually attributed to the flu virus itself, particularly the H3N2 strain. This suggests that focusing on Tamiflu as the cause of increased deaths may be misguided."}
