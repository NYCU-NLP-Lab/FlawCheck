{"The use of a reverse image search": "The expert utilized a reverse image search to trace the origins of the photo and found a Reddit post from April 28 claiming the same image depicted Miami, suggesting that it may have been digitally altered.", "Visual analysis with FotoForensics": "The expert employed FotoForensics, a visual analysis tool, to identify two distinct halves of the image - the foreground with the buildings and the background with the storm. This analysis revealed that the buildings were digitally inserted into the storm photo.", "Comparison with Google Earth": "To determine the actual location of the buildings in the image, the expert turned to Google Earth and found a spot in North Miami Beach that matched the foreground of the altered image. This comparison confirmed that the image was not taken in the Bahamas.", "Verification from additional sources": "Snopes reported that the clouds in the image were taken from a different photo of a thunderstorm in Kansas in 2016, while the North Beach image was a stock photo. The expert also consulted the artist who originally published the image on Instagram, who confirmed that it was digitally altered. These additional sources further verified the inauthenticity of the claim."}
