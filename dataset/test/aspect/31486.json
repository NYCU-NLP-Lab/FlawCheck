{"Rep": "Joe Cunningham's demonstration: The expert noted that Rep. Cunningham used an airhorn to provide a visual and auditory comparison to the seismic airgun blasting. This demonstration went viral and helped to illustrate the potential loudness of the seismic airgun blasting.", "Comparison of decibel levels": "The expert mentioned that an apples-to-apples comparison of decibel levels was conducted between the seismic arrays and the airhorn. It was found that the seismic arrays emitted sound waves that were 19,000 to 10 million times more intense than the airhorn.", "Perception of loudness": "The expert explained that loudness is a matter of human perception and can vary across species. While decibel levels can be measured, the perception of loudness is subjective. This aspect was considered when evaluating the claim.", "Use of marine biologists": "approach: The expert mentioned that marine biologists use decibel comparisons to assess sound levels rather than solely focusing on loudness. This approach was employed to verify the claim about the seismic airgun blasting being 16,000 times louder than the airhorn."}
