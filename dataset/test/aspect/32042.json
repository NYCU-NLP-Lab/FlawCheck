{"Social media engagement": "The claim received significant engagement on both Twitter and Facebook, with thousands of retweets, likes, and shares. This indicates that the claim caught the attention of a large audience.", "Watermarks on the image": "The image in question contained two watermarks. One watermark led back to an Instagram account that posted a similar image with a caption related to porcine cysticercosis. The other watermark was from a Brazil-based social network that claimed to show rare cases not found in anatomy books. These watermarks provide additional context and sources for the image.", "Expert analysis": "Dr. Nqoba Tsabedze, an academic head of cardiology, provided his expert opinion on the claim. He explained that the image did not show the effects of eating pork but rather an infection from a parasite. This expert analysis adds credibility to the debunking of the claim.", "Lack of response from the account holder": "The expert reached out to the Instagram account that originally posted the image but did not receive a reply. This lack of response raises questions about the authenticity and credibility of the claim."}
