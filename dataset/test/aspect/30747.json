It relied solely on the article published on ConservativeTears.com, which is known for spreading misinformation.", "Contradictory information": "The expert's verdict mentioned that Sam Elliott is alive and well, with references to other sources such as Snopes.com and The New York Times. These sources provide further evidence that the claim of his death is false."}
