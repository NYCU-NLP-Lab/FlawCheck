{"Graduation Rate Increase": "The expert's verdict confirms that there was a significant increase in graduation rates during Bloomberg's tenure as mayor. The data provided by the state Department of Education shows that the graduation rate rose from 46.5 percent for the class starting in 2001 to 66 percent by 2013, representing a 42 percent increase.", "Reduction of Racial Achievement Gap": "The expert's verdict also supports Bloomberg's claim of substantially reducing the racial achievement gap. While the specific data or statistics regarding the achievement gap are not mentioned in the given information, the expert, Ray Domanico, who had access to the school's data, affirms the success of Bloomberg's efforts in reducing the gap.", "Mayoral Control of Public School System": "The expert mentions that Bloomberg was granted mayoral control of the public school system in 2002, consolidating power and accountability in his office. This aspect highlights the structural change implemented by Bloomberg, which allowed for centralized decision-making and potentially facilitated the implementation of his education policies.", "Support from President Obama": "Bloomberg's claim also includes the assistance received from President Obama's administration in New York City's Race to the Top application. This collaboration aimed to raise standards and improve the quality of school options, including charters, for families who had previously lacked them. The expert's verdict does not directly address this aspect, but it provides context and corroborates Bloomberg's claim of receiving help from the Obama administration."}
