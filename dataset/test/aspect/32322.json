{"The non": "partisan Pew Center on the States issued a report stating that the nation's voter registration rolls are plagued with problems, with about one record in eight being inaccurate or invalid, and approximately 1.8 million registered voters being deceased. This report provides evidence of the overall issues with voter registration accuracy, supporting the claim that Ohio may not be meeting its obligation.", "State Rep": "Kathleen Clyde, a Democrat from Kent, raised concerns about flaws in Ohio's voter database, specifically mentioning the state's high number of provisional ballots as a result of a change of address. Provisional ballots are used when there is a question about a voter's eligibility, and Clyde points to the inadequacy of updating voter registrations when voters change their address with the BMV as a prime reason for this issue. This highlights a specific problem related to the claim.", "Clyde cites the National Voter Registration Act of 1993": "also known as the Motor Voter Act and NVRA), which requires states to keep voter registration lists accurate and current. It specifically states that any change of address submitted for driver's license purposes must also serve as notification of an address change for voter registration purposes, unless the license-holder indicates otherwise. This legislation establishes a legal obligation for Ohio to update voter registrations when voters change their address with the BMV.", "The U": "S. Election Assistance Commission produced a report on the effects of the voting act on voter registration, suggesting that Ohio is not meeting the requirements of federal law. This report further supports the claim that Ohio may not be fulfilling its obligation to update voter registrations when voters change their address with the BMV."}
