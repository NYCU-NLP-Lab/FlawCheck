{"Testimony of local authorities": "The statements of Yedlapadu police station SI Srihari and Narasaraopet sub-collector Srivas Nupur, who both confirmed that there was no encroachment on the hill hosting the Hindu religious sites, serve as evidence to verify the authenticity of the claim.", "Video evidence": "The Guntur rural district police uploaded a video on Twitter showing that the Hindu place of worship is located on a different hilltop, separate from the hill where the cross is allegedly erected. This video provides visual proof that supports the debunking of the claim.", "Lack of evidence of encroachment": "The fact that no evidence or documentation was provided to support the claim of an illegal Christian cross being erected on the hillrock with the Hindu shrine raises doubts about its authenticity. The absence of any concrete evidence weakens the credibility of the claim.", "Multiple debunking sources": "The fact that multiple sources, including local authorities, have refuted the claim and provided alternative explanations further strengthens the case against the authenticity of the claim. The statements from BJP leaders and the RSS publication Organiser, who amplified the claim, are countered by the statements of the police and district administration, creating a conflict of information."}
