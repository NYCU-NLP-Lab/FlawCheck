{"Executive order": "The expert mentions that in June 2018, President Trump signed an executive order reversing the \"family separation\" immigration policy, indicating that immigrant children would no longer be taken from their parents at the border.", "Existing children in custody": "The expert states that despite the executive order, there were still at least 2,000 children separated from their families and held in detention centers around the country. This verifies the claim that immigrant children were indeed being held in detention centers.", "Reports on social media": "The expert mentions that reports began appearing on social media about children being forced to recite the Pledge of Allegiance daily in at least one of the facilities. This serves as evidence supporting the claim.", "Comparison to historical instances": "The expert highlights the criticism and comparisons made between the routine of reciting the Pledge of Allegiance by detained migrant children and similar practices imposed on Japanese-American children during World War II. This comparison adds further weight to the claim."}
