{"The House vote on May 31": "2011, on whether to raise the federal debt ceiling without spending cuts was resoundingly defeated, with 318 votes against and 87 votes in favor. This vote indicates that there was opposition to the claim made by the Democratic Reps.", "The National Republican Congressional Committee": "NRCC) launched robocalls accusing 11 Democratic House members, including the four mentioned in the claim, of wanting to raise the debt limit without making any spending cuts. This suggests that the NRCC used the claim as a basis for their political messaging.", "The first version of the robocalls was sent to constituents of Democratic House members who actually voted in favor of raising the debt ceiling": "This discrepancy raises questions about the accuracy of the claim made in the second version of the robocalls.", "The NRCC spokesperson explained that the claim in the second version of the robocalls referred to a letter penned by Rep": "Peter Welch, D-Vt., and signed by the four targeted House members. The letter called for a \"clean extension of the debt ceiling,\" indicating their support for raising the debt limit without spending cuts. This provides evidence to support the claim made by the NRCC in the robocalls."}
