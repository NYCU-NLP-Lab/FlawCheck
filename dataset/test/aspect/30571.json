This raises doubts about the credibility and reliability of the information presented in the article.", "Inaccurate details": "The article mentioned that Ross Perot had 11 children who agreed to donate $9 million each to the Trump 2020 campaign. However, it was revealed that Perot actually had five children with different names. This discrepancy in the details provided in the article casts doubt on its authenticity.", "Implausible statements": "The article attributed statements to a Perot spokesman, including references to the \"death of Democracy\" and a \"New World Order.\" These statements were deemed outlandish and implausible, further questioning the credibility of the claim.", "Moniker usage": "The expert pointed out that the name \"Art Tubolls,\" given as Perot's spokesman, was actually a moniker used by Christopher Blair, the producer of junk news and misinformation. This inconsistency suggests that the article was likely fabricated."}
