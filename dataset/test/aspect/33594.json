{"The claim is based on a statement made by Sen": "Cory Booker during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on school safety and gun policies.", "The claim refers to research that shows 1 percent of licensed dealers supply 57 percent of the guns recovered in crimes": "3. The claim is supported by a 2000 report from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) that found 1.2 percent of licensed gun dealers accounted for over 57 percent of crime guns traced to current dealers in 1998.", "The ATF no longer uses the 2000 report to evaluate current crime trends": "and they caution that tracing a gun used in a crime back to a dealer does not necessarily indicate illegal activity by the dealer or its employees."}
