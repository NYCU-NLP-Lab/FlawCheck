{"Arizona law requires a hand count of a sample of ballots to test the accuracy of the vote tabulation equipment": "and this was followed in 10 out of the state's 15 counties. Hand recounts in the four largest counties found errors within the acceptable margin, but not the claimed \"switching\" or erasing of ballots.", "The only": "audit\" conducted in Arizona was prompted by a lawsuit filed by the state Republican Party Chairwoman. This audit found an error rate of 0.55% in Maricopa County, not the claimed 3% error rate.", "A review of duplicated mail": "in ballots, prompted by the lawsuit, found nine errors out of 1,626 total duplicated ballots. These errors would have resulted in seven additional votes for Trump and two additional votes for Biden, making the overall results \"99.45% accurate\" according to the state Supreme Court.", "Republican Congressman Gosar": "s claim that the court stopped the audit and refused to go further is false. The court's ruling denied Ward's request for an expanded audit, but it did not stop the audit altogether."}
