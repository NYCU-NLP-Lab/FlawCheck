{"The claim is based on calculations by Charles J": "Cicchetti, which state that the probability of Joe Biden winning the popular vote in Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin independently, given President Trump's early lead in those states, is less than one in a quadrillion.", "The claim gained traction online and spread widely on Facebook after the Texas attorney general": "s lawsuit was filed, and it was repeated by White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany and various conservative websites.", "The expert points out that Cicchetti": "s statistical calculations are flawed because they assume that any two large groups of voters should generate similar results, ignoring the fact that groups can split drastically by geography. For example, different counties in Wisconsin had significantly different voting patterns due to demographic differences.", "The expert also highlights that Cicchetti": "s methodology focuses primarily on Georgia, where Trump initially had a lead but ultimately lost. This raises questions about the validity of his analysis, as the votes tabulated in different time periods may not be random samples from the same population of votes cast."}
