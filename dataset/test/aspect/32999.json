{"Lack of evidence": "The expert's verdict highlights that there is no concrete evidence or factual basis to support the claim of a \"connection\" between Nikolas Cruz and former President Barack Obama. This lack of evidence undermines the authenticity of the claim.", "Spurious premises": "The article and other sources attempting to establish a connection between Cruz and Obama rely on spurious premises, meaning they are based on false or misleading assumptions. These premises further weaken the credibility of the claim.", "Factual inaccuracies": "The expert's verdict points out that the links drawn between Cruz and Obama are based on factual inaccuracies. These inaccuracies undermine the reliability and authenticity of the claim, as they demonstrate a lack of thorough research and verification.", "Examination of the PROMISE program": "The claim revolves around a supposed connection between Cruz and Obama through the PROMISE program. The expert's verdict explains the purpose and nature of the program, highlighting that it is an intervention program for student behavior and not a direct link between Cruz and Obama. This examination of the program provides a clear understanding of the context and further discredits the claim."}
