{"Lack of visual evidence": "Despite claims of protesters storming the Georgia and Kansas Capitol buildings, news reports and eyewitness accounts from people in those states have not provided any visual evidence or images illustrating such incidents.", "Contradictory reports": "While some national news organizations published reports supporting the claim, such as Insider reporting that \"Pro-Trump rioters reportedly attempted to storm the Georgia Capitol,\" other reputable sources contradicted these claims. Reporters like Richard Fausset and Stephen Fowler stated that only small groups of protestors gathered outside the Capitol buildings, with no evidence of storming or breaching.", "Precautionary measures taken": "Reports mentioned that Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and his staff were removed from the Capitol as a precaution due to perceived threats. However, this action was taken as a preventive measure, not in response to any actual storming or breach of the building.", "Presence of controversial figures": "The presence of Chester Doles, founder of the American Patriots USA and a former KKK leader, at the Georgia State Capitol was reported by a photojournalist. However, this does not necessarily indicate that protesters had stormed the building, as Doles was seen looking for the office of Brad Raffensperger, suggesting a different purpose for his presence."}
