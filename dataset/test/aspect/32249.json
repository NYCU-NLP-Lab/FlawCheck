{"The claim that cancer is caused by a deficiency of vitamin": "B17\" is not supported by scientific research. The expert mentions that there is an exhaustive body of research demonstrating that the use of amygdalin, laetrile, or \"vitamin B17\" is both ineffective and potentially dangerous in treating cancer.", "The story of": "B17 deficiency\" exhibits characteristics of a classic snake oil campaign. It promotes a simple and easy cure for all cancer provided by nature, while alleging a widespread conspiracy to prevent the public from knowing about it. The expert emphasizes that such claims often fuel anti-government conspiracies.", "The expert draws a parallel between the historical case of scurvy and the claim of cancer being a deficiency of vitamin B17": "They highlight that scurvy was initially believed to be a disease, but it was later discovered to be a deficiency of vitamin C. This comparison suggests that the claim of cancer being solely a deficiency of vitamin B17 is oversimplified and lacking scientific evidence.", "The expert explains that the notion of": "vitamin B17\" was essentially made up by Ernst Krebs Jr., who invented a partially synthetic chemical called laetrile. The expert clarifies that no official pharmacopoeia lists laetrile as a vitamin, and it does not possess the required characteristics of a vitamin. This information questions the authenticity and validity of the claim."}
