{"Temporary installation": "The expert's verdict states that the installation of the seesaws at the border was temporary, lasting only about a day before being taken down. This aspect verifies the authenticity of the claim as it confirms that the installation did occur but was not a permanent fixture.", "Video evidence": "A viral video showing the seesaws installed along the border wall between Mexico and the United States is mentioned in the expert's verdict. The existence of this video provides visual evidence of the installation and supports the claim's authenticity.", "Artist involvement": "The claim mentions that the installation was done by an artist. The expert's verdict confirms this by stating that the seesaws were designed by architect Ronald Rael and brought to life with the help of a group of artists in Juarez, Mexico. The involvement of artists in the project adds credibility to the claim.", "Historical context": "The expert's verdict mentions that the idea of border seesaws was first conceptualized in 2009 by California professors Ronald Rael and Virginia San Fratello. This historical context provides additional evidence of the authenticity of the claim, as it shows that the installation was not a random event but part of a larger project that had been in development for several years."}
