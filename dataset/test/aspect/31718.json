{"Comparison of COVID": "19 cases before and after reopening: The expert's verdict mentions that the number of cases in Georgia actually fell by 12% compared to the period before reopening. This indicates that the claim of a 40% increase in COVID-19 rate is not accurate.", "Lack of accurate data": "The expert's verdict highlights that there are problems with data accuracy in Georgia, particularly in tracking deaths at long-term care facilities. Without reliable data, it is challenging to determine the exact number of cases and ascertain the validity of the claim.", "Timing of the claim": "The claim was made in an interview by Stacey Abrams, a Georgia Democrat, after the reopening of the state. The expert's verdict points out that the 12-day period after the reopening actually saw a decrease in cases, contradicting the claim of a 40% increase.", "Reliance on withdrawn source": "The expert's verdict mentions that Abrams relied on a post that briefly appeared on Forbes.com, but was later withdrawn. This raises questions about the credibility of the source and the accuracy of the information used to make the claim."}
