{"Discrepancy in the dog": "s name: The expert's verdict highlights that the dog in the photo is referred to as Captain, while the actual dog who slept at his owner's grave was named Capit\u00e1n. This inconsistency raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Inaccurate description of the dog": "The expert's verdict mentions that the dog in the photo appears to be a yellow lab, whereas the real Capit\u00e1n was described as a mutt with some German Shepherd traits. This discrepancy in the dog's appearance further questions the credibility of the claim.", "Contradictory timeline": "The expert's verdict provides details about Capit\u00e1n's story, indicating that he started sleeping at his owner's grave in January 2007, not seven years prior to the post as claimed. The conflicting timeline undermines the accuracy of the claim.", "Lack of supporting evidence": "Although the expert's verdict mentions a news story and a video confirming Capit\u00e1n's presence at the cemetery, there is no mention of any concrete evidence or documentation supporting the claim that the dog in the photo has slept by his master's grave for seven years. The absence of substantial proof weakens the authenticity of the claim."}
