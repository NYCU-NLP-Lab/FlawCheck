{"Lack of evidence from credible sources": "The expert's verdict states that there is no record of President Donald Trump making the statement or expressing a similar thought in any official public record such as interviews, speeches, press briefings, tweets, or other documented sources.", "Anonymous origin": "The claim appears to have been created by an anonymous netizen and not directly attributed to President Trump. The formatting of the message may have caused some readers to misinterpret it as a message from Trump rather than to him.", "Identical wording in online petitions": "The sentiment expressed in the claim has been found in several online petitions, suggesting that it may have originated from a common source rather than directly from President Trump.", "Inconsistency with official actions": "The claim suggests that President Trump advocated for the pay of public officials to be stopped during the COVID-19 pandemic, but it is inconsistent with the actions taken by state and local governments to issue temporary orders imposing shelter-in-place, lockdown, and business closure restrictions. These actions resulted in many businesses laying off workers, leaving some people without paychecks for an indefinite period of time."}
