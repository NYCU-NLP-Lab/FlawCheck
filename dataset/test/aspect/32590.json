{"The claim was based on the statement made by WPRO talk show host John DePetro during an interview with Brett Smiley": "who planned to run for mayor of Providence. DePetro asserted that under Mayor David Cicilline, Providence was a sanctuary city.", "The expert investigated previous claims regarding Cicilline": "s stance on sanctuary cities and found no evidence to support the claim that he espoused Providence as a sanctuary city during his tenure as mayor. This ruling suggests that the authenticity of the claim was examined based on Cicilline's past actions and statements.", "DePetro justified his claim by pointing out what he perceived as Providence": "s lack of cooperation with federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials. He specifically mentioned the mishandling of a 2008 rape case involving an illegal immigrant, Marco Riz, to support his argument. This aspect suggests that the expert considered the alleged actions or policies of the city's law enforcement in relation to immigration enforcement.", "The expert also mentioned the use of electronic transmission of arrested suspects": "fingerprints to the attorney general's office, which then adds them to national databases monitored by ICE. This indicates that the expert took into account the current practices and measures implemented by Providence to cooperate with federal immigration authorities, potentially as a response to previous incidents."}
