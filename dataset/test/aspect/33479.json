{"Biden": "s statements on police reform: The expert refers to Biden's statements where he supports conditioning federal aid to police based on certain standards and emphasizes the need for police reform instead of defunding. These statements further contradict the claim made in the ad and provide evidence against it.", "Trump": "s campaign ad: The expert mentions a 30-second ad by Trump's reelection campaign that claims Biden is \"absolutely on board with defunding the police.\" This ad serves as evidence of the claim being made, but its authenticity and accuracy can be questioned."}
