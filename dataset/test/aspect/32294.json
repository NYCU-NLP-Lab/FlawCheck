{"Ted Olson": "s statement on Fox News Sunday: Ted Olson, a Republican attorney who supports same-sex marriage, stated on Fox News Sunday that the Supreme Court has said \"marriage is a fundamental right\" 15 times over the last 120 years. This statement serves as the primary basis for the claim's authenticity.", "The brief filed in the case Hollingsworth vs": "Perry: Olson pointed to a brief he and his colleagues filed in the case Hollingsworth vs. Perry, which the Supreme Court declined to hear. The brief stated that the Supreme Court has recognized marriage as a \"fundamental right\" in \"more than a dozen\" cases. This brief provides additional evidence to support the claim.", "Review by outside legal experts": "Independent legal experts reviewed the cases cited by Olson and confirmed that they generally support his claim. These experts also stated that there are likely more than just 15 examples of the Supreme Court not addressing whether marriage is confined to heterosexual couples.", "Lack of precedent for limiting marriages to heterosexual couples": "Olson argued that there is no precedent for the Supreme Court justices to limit marriages to heterosexual couples only. He highlighted that in none of the 15 cases mentioned did the Court specify that marriage had to be between a man and a woman. This lack of precedent further strengthens the authenticity of the claim."}
