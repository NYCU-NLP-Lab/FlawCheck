{"Comparison of uninsured rates": "The expert would have analyzed the claim by comparing the uninsured rate in New York in 2013 to the current uninsured rate. This would involve examining data from reliable sources such as the Centers for Disease Control to determine the accuracy of the claim.", "Examination of enrollment data": "The expert would have looked at the enrollment data provided by the state Department of Health to verify the number of people who have enrolled in a health plan through the state exchange since 2013. This data would help determine if the claim of cutting the uninsured rate in half is supported by actual enrollment numbers.", "Evaluation of premium changes": "The expert would have assessed the claim that premiums dropped 53 percent in the first year of the exchange and examined the trend of average premiums since then. This analysis would help determine if the decrease in uninsured rate can be attributed to the Affordable Care Act and its impact on premiums.", "Assessment of additional factors": "The expert would have considered other factors mentioned in the article, such as the availability of low-cost health insurance for those who don't qualify for Medicaid and the expansion of the income threshold. These factors could have influenced the uninsured rate and would need to be taken into account when evaluating the authenticity of the claim."}
