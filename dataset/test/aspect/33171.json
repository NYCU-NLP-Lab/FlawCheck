{"Immigration rates": "The number of people apprehended by the U.S. Border Patrol, although an imperfect metric, has shown a mostly steady decline over the years, indicating that illegal immigration may be lower than in previous decades.", "Enforcement measures": "The fact that enforcement has gotten stricter in recent years suggests that efforts to control illegal immigration have increased, potentially contributing to lower rates.", "Crime rates": "Despite some preliminary data indicating a possible uptick in crime in recent years, overall trends from annual data compiled by the FBI show that violent crime has been falling steadily since the early 1990s.", "Economic conditions": "The number of people attempting to cross the border illegally is influenced by economic conditions, which are not solely under the control of a president. This factor may contribute to fluctuations in immigration rates."}
