{"Examination of historical data": "The expert analyzed past economic data and looked for instances where government spending decreased to verify the claim. They specifically mentioned three periods after World War II when government spending decreased.", "Comparison of spending and job data": "The expert acknowledged that comparing spending data to job data can be challenging due to different fiscal years and calendar years. They examined the relationship between government spending and private sector employment during the periods of decreased government spending to assess the claim.", "Consideration of external factors": "The expert highlighted that factors other than government spending, such as the post-war economic boom and the industrial devastation in Europe, played a significant role in job growth during certain periods of decreased government spending. They emphasized the need to consider these external factors when evaluating the claim.", "Analysis of alternative scenarios": "The expert also took into account the suggestion of Brian Riedl from the Heritage Foundation to examine job expansion in years where government spending grew at a slower rate than GDP. This approach allowed them to assess the impact of government spending as a proportion of the overall economy on private sector job growth."}
