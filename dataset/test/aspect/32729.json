{"Different numbers being debated": "The expert's verdict mentions that social media users in Canada were arguing about the average salary of public school teachers in Ontario using widely different numbers. This indicates that there was no consensus on the actual average salary.", "Union strike and ongoing contract negotiations": "The expert's verdict highlights that the debates about teacher salaries were spurred by the ongoing contract negotiations between the Ontario Ministry of Education and the Ontario Secondary School Teachers\u2019 Federation (OSSTF), which represents 60,000 teachers. The fact that the union held a one-day strike to protest the government's position during talks adds to the context of the claim.", "Inaccurate figure from a Facebook post": "The expert's verdict mentions a Facebook post that claimed the average salary for public school teachers in Ontario is Can$59,517, which was presented as an inaccurate number being spread by conservatives to justify cuts. This suggests that there were conflicting figures being shared on social media.", "Official data from the Ontario Ministry of Education": "The expert's verdict states that the Ontario Ministry of Education provided the average provincially funded teacher salary as Cad$90,469 in 2018-2019, and Cad$92,913 for high school teachers. These numbers are based on the salary grids reported by school boards. This official data provides a more reliable source for verifying the authenticity of the claim."}
