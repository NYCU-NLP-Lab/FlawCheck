{"The seven biggest one": "day point drops in Dow Jones history did take place during Republican presidencies.", "Points drops are a skewed measure of stock market indices": "Nine of the 10 biggest one-day percentage increases in history took place during Republican presidencies; stock market changes often happen regardless (or in spite) of the identity, party affiliation, and policies of a given president.", "The meme correctly lists the seven biggest one": "day points drops in Dow Jones history, which all took place during the tenure of two Republican presidents, though it leaves out the eighth, ninth, and 10th, which occurred with Democrats Bill Clinton and Barack Obama in the White House.", "The main problem with the meme is that its conclusion overstates the influence of a president on stock market trends": "as one-day losses and gains can sometimes happen despite the policies and efforts of the person in the Oval Office."}
