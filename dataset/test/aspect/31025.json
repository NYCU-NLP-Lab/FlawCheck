{"Use of statistics": "The expert's verdict relies on the use of statistics to verify the claim. The figures provided by political scientist Micah Zenko, based on U.S. military press releases and news reports, indicate that Obama authorized 542 drone strikes resulting in the deaths of 3,797 people, including 324 civilians.", "Verification through official reports": "The expert mentions that the Office of the Director of National Intelligence released two reports on drone strikes under the Obama administration. These reports provide information on the number of strikes and fatalities, with specific details on combatants and civilians killed. The reports confirm that there were a total of 526 strikes in the specified regions, excluding Obama's final 20 days in office.", "Comparison with other sources": "The expert highlights that independent organizations tracking air strikes in the U.S.-led global war on terror generally produce higher figures than those provided by official reports. While not explicitly stated, this suggests that the claim of Obama authorizing over 500 drone strikes aligns with the information from independent sources.", "Corroboration of information": "The expert's verdict mentions that social media users widely shared the claim about Obama's drone strikes, attributing it to Micah Zenko's research. The expert verifies the accuracy of the claim by referencing Zenko's figures and the sources he used, such as U.S. military press releases and news reports. This corroboration strengthens the authenticity of the claim."}
