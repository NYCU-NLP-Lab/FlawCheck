{"Financial disclosure reports": "Senators are not required to disclose their true net worth, but they are required to submit financial disclosure reports. These reports allow them to list broad dollar-value ranges for their assets and debts.", "Study by the Center for Responsive Politics": "Feingold's campaign cites a widely quoted 2009 study by the Center for Responsive Politics. This nonpartisan research group used the senators' reported asset and liability figures from 2008 to approximate their net worth. The study found that 67 out of 100 senators had a net worth greater than $1 million.", "Updated study by PolitiFact Wisconsin": "PolitiFact Wisconsin updated the Center for Responsive Politics' study to include three new senators who were appointed or elected after the original study came out. Based on their calculations using the same methodology, two of the new senators had a net worth above $1 million.", "Estimation and projection": "The Feingold campaign used the numbers from the Center for Responsive Politics' study and the updated study by PolitiFact Wisconsin to estimate that Ron Johnson would be the 70th millionaire in the Senate if he wins the election. However, it should be noted that the composition of the Senate may change due to retirements, primary losses, and election results."}
