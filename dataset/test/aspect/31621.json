{"Comparison of tax rates": "The expert's verdict mentions that the campaign compared the 2012 total tax rate for Travis County with the rates in other counties that are home to the state's five largest cities. A chart was included to indicate that Travis County had a higher rate compared to Harris, Dallas, Tarrant, Bexar, and El Paso counties.", "Definition of an urban county": "Since there is no statutory definition of an urban county, the campaign defined it as a county that has a 'big city' in it that is often compared to other big cities around Texas. This definition was used to ensure that the comparison was made between similar counties.", "Data from the Texas Association of Counties": "The expert conducted their own research using data collected by the Texas Association of Counties. The research indicated that among the 15 most populous counties, Travis County had the second-highest total property tax rate in 2012 and 2013.", "Comparison with other populous counties": "The expert's research showed that Travis County's tax rates in 2012 and 2013 were higher than the total rates in the state's four more populous counties, namely Harris, Dallas, Tarrant, and Bexar counties. This comparison further supported the claim that Travis County had the highest urban county tax rate in Texas."}
