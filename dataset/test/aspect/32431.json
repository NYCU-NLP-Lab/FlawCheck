{"Former Florida Gov": "Jeb Bush criticized perceived failures in the economy and jobs in a speech in Detroit on Feb. 4, 2015.", "Bush claimed that": "six years after the recession ended, median incomes are down, households are, on average, poorer, and millions of people have given up looking for work altogether.\"", "The expert checked with Bush": "s staff and they pointed to two Bureau of Labor Statistics data points - \"marginally attached workers\" and \"discouraged workers\" - as evidence for the claim.", "According to the data": "in December 2014, there were 2.26 million marginally attached workers, of which 740,000 were considered discouraged workers. Using the definition of \"marginally attached workers,\" Bush's claim of \"millions of people have given up looking for work altogether\" is accurate, but using the more specific \"discouraged workers\" definition, the number does not reach into the \"millions.\""}
