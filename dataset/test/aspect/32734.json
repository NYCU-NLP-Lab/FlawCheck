{"The paper claiming that COVID": "19 SARS-CoV-2 virus is man-made has not been peer-reviewed and has reached faulty conclusions.", "The genomic sequence of SARS": "CoV-2 is significantly different from the bat coronavirus discovered by military laboratories in China, making it unlikely that the virus was created by altering the bat coronavirus.", "The claim that SARS": "CoV-2 contains a unique furin-cleavage site in its Spike protein, which is absent in coronaviruses found in nature, is not substantiated.", "Manipulating the virus to create SARS": "CoV-2 would be virtually impossible, as it would require a reverse genetics system and knowledge of how to manipulate the virus, which is unlikely to be known."}
