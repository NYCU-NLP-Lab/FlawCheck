{"Lack of evidence and sources": "The expert notes that the Facebook post claiming that ICE has not deported or detained any white illegal immigrants does not provide any sources or evidence to support the claim. This lack of substantiation raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Absence of corresponding news stories or government data": "The expert conducted a search for corresponding news stories or government data to verify the claim but found none. The absence of any official records or news reports supporting the claim further questions its authenticity.", "ICE does not track deportations based on race or ethnicity": "The expert highlights that ICE does not have a system in place to track deportations based on race or ethnicity. While the agency has statistics on where people are sent, this information alone does not indicate someone's race. This fact undermines the claim that ICE has not deported any white illegal immigrants.", "Instances of white immigrants being deported": "The expert presents examples of white immigrants who have been deported by ICE. One example is John Cunningham, a man from Ireland who was deported for overstaying his visa. The expert also mentions Dylan O'Riordan, another man from Ireland who was detained and scheduled for deportation by ICE. These instances contradict the claim that no white immigrants have been deported by ICE."}
