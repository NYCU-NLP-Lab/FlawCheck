{"Incumbent Republican Sen": "Thom Tillis had the lowest approval rating of all senators at one point last year, according to one poll.", "Cal Cunningham": "who was endorsed by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, raised more than $1 million in the third quarter of 2019 alone, but in the polls, Cunningham hasn't separated from NC Sen. Erica Smith, who raised about $40,000 that quarter.", "Smith has polled well in some instances": "with her best performance being 46 percent support to Tillis' 39 percent in an Emerson College poll. However, this poll was conducted before Cunningham entered the race, and early campaign polls should not be given significant weight.", "Smith can claim to have polled ahead of each of her opponents at some point": "but she is not the only one who can claim to be polling ahead of Tillis. Cunningham also scored better than Tillis in at least one poll."}
