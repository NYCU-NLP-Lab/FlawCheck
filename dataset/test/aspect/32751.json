{"Uniquely evolved gastrointestinal system": "The expert's verdict highlights that scientists discovered that the cube-shaped droppings of wombats are the result of a uniquely evolved gastrointestinal system. This aspect suggests that the shape of the feces is not determined by a cube-shaped anus, as previously proposed.", "Contractions": "timing, and rigidity: The research published in the Royal Society of Chemistry's journal Soft Matter suggests that wombats produce their distinctive cube-shaped droppings through a combination of contractions, timing, and rigidity throughout the intestinal tract. This aspect emphasizes the role of these factors in shaping the feces.", "Round sphincters": "CT scans of wombats' anuses revealed that their sphincters are round, not square-shaped as previously believed. This aspect indicates that the shape of the anus does not contribute to the formation of cube-shaped droppings.", "Slow passage and intestinal structure": "Wombats have a slow passage of feces through their long intestines, which are over 33 feet long, nearly 10 times the length of their body. This, combined with the varying stiffness at the end of the intestine and longitudinal bands, causes the intestine to contract differentially. This aspect highlights the role of the slow passage and intestinal structure in the formation of cube-shaped droppings."}
