{"Lack of evidence": "The expert's verdict states that there is no credible evidence, such as news reports or budget statements, to support the claim that Nancy Pelosi used $15,000 worth of pens to sign the articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump.", "Origin of the claim": "The claim appears to have originated from random social media users who may not have had access to accurate information. The expert's verdict highlights that these users were likely making up the information without any factual basis.", "Conflicting claims": "The cost of the pens mentioned in the claim varies significantly across different social media posts, ranging from $2,025 per pen to $15,000 per pen. The expert's verdict points out the inconsistency in these claims, further questioning their credibility.", "Official clarification": "Drew Hammill, Pelosi's deputy chief of staff, confirmed that the pens used to sign the articles of impeachment cost just under $15 each. This official clarification contradicts the exaggerated claim made on social media and provides a more accurate understanding of the actual cost of the pens."}
