{"Comparison to Mexico": "s beer market: The expert's verdict includes a comparison between the potential outcome of allowing brewpubs to sell beer in Georgia and the beer market in Mexico. The expert suggests that if brewpubs are allowed to sell beer, it could lead to a market similar to Mexico where only a couple of manufacturers control all aspects of the market.", "Lobbying efforts": "The expert mentions the lobbying efforts of Nancy Palmer, the executive director of the Georgia Craft Brewers Guild, on behalf of the craft beer industry. This indicates that there is active advocacy for the change in state law to allow breweries and brew pubs to sell directly to consumers.", "Opposition from beer wholesalers and retailers": "The expert mentions that the state's beer wholesalers and retailers oppose the change in state law. This opposition suggests that there are existing stakeholders in the beer market who are against allowing direct sales from breweries and brew pubs.", "Comparison to other states": "The expert mentions that at least 45 other states already allow breweries and brew pubs to sell their products directly to consumers. This comparison highlights that Georgia is lagging behind other states in terms of allowing such sales and suggests that there may be valid reasons for other states to have implemented this change."}
