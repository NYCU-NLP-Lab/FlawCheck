{"Lack of empirical evidence": "The expert points out that much of the evidence provided in support of the claim is anecdotal and lacks empirical data. None of the articles directly compare the availability of guns to computers or books, let alone specifically mention the Glock handgun.", "Scarcity of books in low": "income areas: One study conducted by New York University researchers found a scarcity of children's books in low-income areas of Detroit, Los Angeles, and Washington. However, this study did not compare the availability of guns and did not take into account public libraries or school libraries, which could provide access to books.", "Personal accounts of gun availability": "The expert highlights personal accounts that suggest obtaining a gun in certain neighborhoods is relatively easy. One Chicago resident stated that getting a gun in her neighborhood is as simple as buying a pack of gum. Another African-American writer from Baltimore mentioned buying his first gun from individuals in his neighborhood who sold guns.", "Lack of comparison between guns": "books, and internet access: The expert notes that none of the provided evidence directly compares the availability of guns to computers or books. References to academic studies about access to food in low-income areas or the relative lack of internet access in low-income households do not address the specific claim made by President Obama."}
