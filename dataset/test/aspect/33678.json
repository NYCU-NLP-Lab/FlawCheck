{"The claim made by Ben Carson was that there were an additional 81": "000 pages of government regulations last year.", "The expert verified this claim by referring to the Federal Register": "which is a daily journal of the U.S. government that contains agency rules, proposed rules, and public notices. The expert confirmed that the final tally for 2015 in the Federal Register was 82,036 new pages of regulations, slightly exceeding Carson's claim.", "The expert also highlighted that the Federal Register includes various types of content": "not just regulations or final rules. Notices about agency meetings, public comment periods, presidential documents, and other items are also included, which do not contribute to the actual number of regulations.", "The expert mentioned that according to Federal Register data": "from 2010 through 2014, only 31 percent of the pages actually contained rules, indicating that the page count may not be an accurate measure of regulatory activity or burden. The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service also supported this notion in a report, stating that many pages have little to do with regulations and that pages dealing with final rules often contain explanations rather than regulatory language."}
