{"The claim is based on a study conducted by the UCLA School of Public Health in 2010": "which used data from the World Health Organization to compare gun-related homicide rates among wealthy nations in 2003.", "The study included 22 other high": "income countries with populations over 1 million people, including Australia, Austria, Canada, Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom (England and Wales), United Kingdom (Northern Ireland), and United Kingdom (Scotland).", "The study found that the rate of homicides with guns in the U": "S. was 4.1 per 100,000 people, while the combined rate of the 22 other countries was 0.2 per 100,000 people in 2003. This means that the U.S. gun homicide rate was 19.5 times higher than the combined rate of other western nations.", "More recent data": "mostly from 2009, showed that the gap between the U.S. gun homicide rate and the rate of other countries had closed slightly. The most recent data indicated a gun homicide rate of 3.0 per 100,000 people in the U.S. and 0.2 per 100,000 people in the 22 other countries. This suggests that the U.S. gun homicide rate was around 15 times higher than the rate of other western nations."}
