{"The claim is roughly accurate": "as the number of people working in the U.S. has increased steadily over time, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.", "However": "the claim is not unique or remarkable when considering population growth, as the number of people employed has generally increased alongside population growth.", "There have been exceptions to this trend during recessions": "such as the Great Recession, when the number of people employed declined despite population growth.", "To provide a more meaningful analysis": "experts suggest looking at other measures such as the labor force participation rate and the employment-population ratio, which indicate the percentage of the population that is working. These measures have not reached record highs, indicating that while more people may be working, it is not the highest level in history."}
