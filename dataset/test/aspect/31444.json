{"Lack of evidence": "PolitiFact was unable to find any evidence of the billboards described by Nielsen. They repeatedly asked for billboard photos or any other evidence to support her claim, but received no response. Experts who study immigration and have traveled to Central America also stated that they have never heard of or seen such billboards.", "Contradictory information": "U.S.-sponsored billboards in Central America during the Obama years aimed to deter illegal immigration, not encourage it. This contradicts the claim that billboards in Central America advertise how to grab a kid to enter the United States illegally.", "Expert testimonies": "Stephanie Leutert, director of the Mexico Security Initiative at the University of Texas at Austin, conducted fieldwork in Guatemala specifically on migration and found no billboards related to migration or promoting migration. She only heard warnings on bus radios about the dangers of traveling to the United States and being abandoned by smugglers in the desert.", "Misrepresentation of immigration process": "The claim suggests that grabbing a kid is a way to enter the United States illegally, but this is not accurate. Immigrants can enter without a child, and traveling with a child does not guarantee entry or a path to citizenship. The law allows parents and children to apply for asylum, even if they entered the country illegally."}
