{"The claim is based on a cartoon by editorial cartoonist Tom Toles from the Washington Post": "which depicts a portrait of a \"U.S. Working Woman\" on a redesigned $10 note worth $7.70.", "The claim is supported by the fact that an advocacy group called Women on 20s petitioned for a woman": "s face to be put on paper currency, and the U.S. Treasury had already announced that the $10 note would be redesigned.", "The U": "S. Census data from 2010 and an updated report from 2012 show a wage gap between men and women, with the female-to-male earnings ratio being 0.77, meaning women working full-time made 77 cents for every dollar earned by men.", "However": "the wage gap statistic is based on total wages and does not account for differences in hours worked or pay for the same work. Other studies, such as those conducted by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, show different conclusions and indicate that the wage gap diminishes when comparing women and men in the same job with the same levels of education and experience."}
