{"The claim is based on a T": "shirt design by artist/designer Hilary Treadwell, which states that \"Rhode Island: 3% bigger at low tide.\"", "The artist did some research on the state": "s area and coastline length, but couldn't provide further evidence or calculations to support the claim.", "Experts from the University of Rhode Island Environmental Data Center state that an accurate calculation would require a Ph": "D. or master's-level study into shallow water bathymetry and an analysis of Rhode Island's tides.", "Geoscientist Bryan Oakley provided a rough estimate": "suggesting that Rhode Island may be about 0.1% bigger at low tide based on the intertidal zone and fluctuation in size between tides. However, he acknowledged that these numbers are very rough and not precise."}
