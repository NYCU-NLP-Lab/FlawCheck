{"The claim that the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation was kicked out of India was found to be false": "The Indian government confirmed that the foundation continues to collaborate and support the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.", "The claim that Bill Gates": "polio vaccine permanently disabled 47,000 children in India is based on a paper that suggests a correlation between the vaccine and an increase in non-polio acute flaccid paralysis (NPAFP) cases. However, this correlation is not proven to be causation, and the paper's claims are far from certain.", "The increase in NPAFP cases in India": "which is used to support the claim, is attributed to better monitoring of paralysis cases rather than solely to the polio vaccine. Public health officials have stated that the higher incidence of NPAFP cases does not necessarily mean the vaccine caused it.", "The Gates Foundation": "s involvement in funding polio vaccine eradication efforts in India is acknowledged. However, there is no evidence to support the claim that the foundation paralyzed hundreds of thousands of children through the vaccine."}
