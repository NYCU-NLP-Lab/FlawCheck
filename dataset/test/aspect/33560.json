{"Eyewitness account": "The expert's verdict includes a description from PBS NewsHour Congressional Reporter Lisa Desjardins, who was present during the riots and witnessed the mob attempting to break into the U.S. Capitol using a flagpole. Desjardins provides a detailed account of the events, including the banging on the door, the breaking of the glass, and the use of a staff holding an American flag.", "Audio evidence": "The expert's verdict mentions that in the livestream broadcast, the sound of shattering glass can be heard in the background, confirming the breaking of the glass door. This audio evidence adds credibility to the claim that the mob used a flagpole to gain entry into the U.S. Capitol.", "Lack of police presence": "The expert's verdict states that Desjardins did not see any Capitol police at the time of the break-in. This aspect supports the claim that the mob was able to breach the building using a flagpole, as the absence of security measures would have made it easier for them to do so.", "Video footage": "Although not explicitly mentioned in the expert's verdict, it is likely that there is video footage available from the livestream broadcast mentioned. This video evidence could further verify the authenticity of the claim by providing visual confirmation of the mob using a flagpole to break into the U.S. Capitol."}
