{"Multiple sources have made similar claims": "The expert's verdict mentions that both Senator Mark Warner and Hillary Clinton have made similar claims about Donald Trump bankrupting businesses. This suggests that the claim is not based on a single source or biased opinion, but rather on multiple individuals who have independently made the same assertion.", "Existence of bankruptcies under Chapter 11": "The expert's verdict explains that some of Trump's companies have indeed sought protection under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy law. This is a distinct aspect that verifies the claim, as Chapter 11 bankruptcy involves reorganizing a company's debts and liabilities, rather than liquidating its assets.", "Identification of specific bankruptcies": "The expert's verdict provides specific examples of Trump's bankruptcies, including the Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City and The Plaza hotel in Manhattan. These specific instances of bankruptcy demonstrate that the claim is based on verifiable facts and not just general accusations.", "Confirmation from PolitiFact National": "The expert's verdict mentions that PolitiFact National has explored claims about Trump's business record and has tallied a list of bankruptcies for his companies. This indicates that an independent fact-checking organization has verified the claim, adding further credibility to the assertion."}
