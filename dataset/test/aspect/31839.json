{"The claim that 60": "of the national energy requirements are from wood fuel is supported by Senator Susan Kihika, who argued that wood fuel makes up 60% of the country's energy supply.", "However": "different government agencies provided different statistics for forestry's share of GDP, indicating a lack of clarity and potentially undermining the authenticity of the claim.", "The most recent economic survey states that wood fuel makes up 63": "2% of Kenya's energy demand, slightly higher than Kihika's claim of 60%. This suggests that the claim may be accurate, but further verification is needed.", "The forestry sector contributes 3": "6% to the national gross domestic product, according to both a government taskforce report and official reports from the Kenya Forest Service. This provides some evidence to support the claim, but the inclusion of wood fuel's contribution to household energy and non-timber products is disputed."}
