{"The claim originated from an article circulating on Facebook": "which stated that Philadelphia police stranded the Washington Redskins in their locker rooms overnight as retaliation for players taking a knee during a game.", "The article included a statement from the Philadelphia Police Department": "mentioning that the officers involved are on the stadium payroll during games and are not subject to disciplinary action. Stadium officials also stated that the matter would be handled internally.", "The source of the claim": "Freedum Junkshun, is a known fake news site that publishes satirical fiction. A disclaimer on their website clearly states the purpose of their content, which is to provide satirical stories to provoke reactions.", "The claim about the Redskins being trapped in their locker rooms is a variation of a previous false claim involving the New Orleans Saints": "where a flight crew supposedly refused to transport the team after players took a knee. The use of an image from a 2016 article further supports the lack of authenticity in the claim."}
