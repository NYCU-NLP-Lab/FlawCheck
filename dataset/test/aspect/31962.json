{"The claim of U": "S. President Donald Trump invoking \"Martial Law\" was based on a fake tweet that was widely shared on social media and various websites in late December 2020.", "The fake tweet capitalized on the calls made by some Trump supporters to invoke martial law and involve the military in the 2020 presidential election due to allegations of widespread fraud": "These supporters claimed that Trump, not President-elect Joe Biden, actually won the election.", "Prior to the fake tweet": "there were news reports circulating in mid-December 2020 that mentioned Trump considering the idea of invoking martial law during a heated meeting at the White House. This sparked backlash, including criticism from U.S. Sen. Mitt Romney, who called it \"embarrassing.\"", "In response to these reports": "Trump himself denied considering martial law and labeled them as false in a tweet on December 19, 2020. Additionally, the Department of Homeland Security, under Trump's own administration, stated that the November 2020 election was the \"most secure in American history\" and debunked Trump's claims of election fraud."}
