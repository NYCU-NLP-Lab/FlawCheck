{"The source of the claim": "The expert mentions that the claim originated from a Facebook user named Ravi Mukhiya who shared the photo on two Facebook groups. This establishes the source of the claim and provides a starting point for verification.", "Reverse image search results": "The expert mentions that a reverse image search using Yandex did not yield the exact same photo but found a similar one shared by a Russian travel website, claiming it to be from the Sivananda Yoga Vedanta Dhanwantari Ashram in Kerala. This comparison helps in determining the authenticity of the claim.", "Similarities between the viral photo and Sivananda Ashram images": "The expert notes that there are several similarities between the viral photo and images of the Sivananda Ashram found on various websites. These similarities include the blue color of the floor, yellow pillars, window size, speakers on the wall, ceiling texture, and fans. These similarities provide evidence that the viral photo may indeed be from the ashram in Kerala.", "Additional evidence from Facebook users": "The expert mentions that some Facebook users have also posted pictures of the Kerala ashram that look very similar to the viral photo.
