{"Rep": "Andr\u00e9 Carson's statement: Rep. Andr\u00e9 Carson, D-Ill., stated that the threat from racial supremacist groups is greater than from jihadists. This statement serves as the initial claim that is being evaluated for authenticity.", "Membership numbers and hateful rhetoric": "The expert mentions that Rep. Carson believes that when looking at relative membership numbers, hateful rhetoric, racially based hate crimes, and fatalities by right-wing organizations, it paints a picture of a larger threat to the safety of Americans and society as a whole. This aspect suggests that Rep. Carson considers the prevalence of racial supremacist groups and their activities as indicators of a significant domestic threat.", "FBI hate crime statistics": "The expert mentions that the FBI reported that in 2014, 47 percent of hate crimes were racially motivated. However, it is noted that hate crimes include a range of offenses, including vandalism and intimidation. This aspect raises the question of whether these types of racially motivated hate crimes should be considered on the same level as attacks by Islamic extremists.", "Fatal attacks by extremists": "The expert cites the New America Foundation's work, which tracks fatal attacks on U.S. soil by \"homegrown extremists.\" The foundation distinguishes between \"violent jihadist attacks\" and \"far right-wing attacks.\" The data provided by the foundation shows that as of mid-December, jihadists had killed 45 people, while non-jihadist extremists claimed the lives of 48. This aspect compares the number of fatalities caused by different types of extremists, suggesting that both pose a significant threat."}
