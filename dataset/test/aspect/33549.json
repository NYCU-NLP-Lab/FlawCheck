{"Historical context": "The expert analyzes the timeframe used by President Obama, noting that he took office during a global economic recession, which affected exports to all countries. This context is important to understand the baseline from which the claim is being made.", "Increase in exports": "The expert calculates the percentage increase in exports to Canada and Mexico during Obama's administration, finding a 51 percent increase overall. This data supports Obama's claim of boosting exports.", "Job creation": "The expert examines the study cited by Obama's office, which states that exports to Mexico supported 1.1 million jobs and exports to Canada supported 1.7 million jobs in 2014. However, the expert points out that these figures reflect the total number of jobs supported by exports, not the number of jobs created by the increase during Obama's administration.", "Misleading language": "The expert highlights that the specific timeframe used by Obama, \"during my administration,\" can be misleading. By starting the analysis from 2008 instead of 2009, the expert finds different percentage increases in exports to Canada and Mexico. This suggests that Obama's claim may not accurately represent the entire trend."}
