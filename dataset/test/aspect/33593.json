{"Losses in recent elections": "The expert's verdict mentions that Texas Republican Ted Cruz based his statement on the losses the Democratic Party suffered in recent elections, including the loss of Senate seats, House seats, governorships, and state legislative seats during the Obama administration.", "Difficulty finding presidential candidates": "Cruz's statement also suggests that the Democratic Party is having a hard time finding anyone to run for president who isn't nearly 207 years old. This implies a potential decline in the party's ability to attract new and fresh candidates.", "Membership size": "While it is challenging to measure the exact membership or size of political parties, the expert suggests that certain measures can provide a relative sense of party size. This includes evaluating the party in the government, the party in the electorate, and party organizations.", "Electoral seats and voter affiliations": "The expert mentions that during Obama's administration, Democrats have lost 13 U.S. Senate seats, 69 House seats, 11 governorships, and 910 state legislative seats. Additionally, the number of voters claiming affiliation with a particular party can also indicate the party's health. However, the exact number of Democratic Party members is difficult to determine due to variations in registration rules."}
