{"Comparison with other industrialized nations": "The expert compared the U.S. health care system to that of other industrialized nations to determine if the claim was accurate. They found that while some other countries do have private, for-profit insurance companies, the business, legal, and regulatory environments in which they operate are quite different from the U.S.", "Analysis of the Dutch health care system": "The expert examined the health care system in the Netherlands as an example of a country with both non-profit and for-profit insurance companies. They highlighted that in the Netherlands, insurers must accept and renew all applicants, and a basic package of services must be offered, limiting the ability of for-profit insurers to compete on price.", "Examination of the Swiss health care system": "The expert also looked at the Swiss health care system, where any profit made by insurers on basic services must be reinvested into reducing premiums. This further supported the notion that for-profit insurers in these countries do not primarily make profits on basic health care.", "Differentiation between basic health care and supplemental coverage": "The expert clarified that in many European countries with for-profit health insurance sectors, the companies make their profits not on basic health care but on supplemental coverage such as dental care, eyeglasses, cosmetic surgery, or more luxurious hospital rooms. This distinction highlighted that the claim specifically referred to basic health care."}
