{"The claim is based on a specific vote that Rep": "Mike Schaufler took on health care legislation during the February 2012 session. This vote was mentioned in a mailer from the Oregon League of Conservation Voters, which accused Schaufler of siding with Tea Party Republicans.", "The mailer cites an article from The Oregonian titled": "A Democrat defects in the Oregon House, stalls insurance bill\" as its source. The article describes the events of the day when Schaufler broke ranks and helped Republicans stall the health insurance bill, throwing the balance of power at the Legislature into question.", "Rep": "Mike Schaufler justified his vote to stall the bill by stating the need to prioritize job creation. He argued that before taking any action during the session, the focus should be on creating jobs and freeing up timber and water resources.", "However": "a few weeks later, on March 2, Schaufler (along with all the other Democratic House members) voted in favor of passing the health care legislation. This final vote indicates that Schaufler ultimately supported the bill, contradicting the claim that he was the only Democrat who voted to stop it."}
