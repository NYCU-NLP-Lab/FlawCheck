{"Historical data": "The expert analyzed historical data from the White House Office of Management and Budget and the Congressional Budget Office to verify the claim. They found that in the past 50 years, from 1960-2010, the federal government balanced the budget five times.", "Budget definition": "The expert discussed the definition of a balanced budget and how it is generally perceived. While technically a budget is considered balanced when federal expenses equal federal revenues, most people consider a budget balanced when revenues meet or exceed expenditures.", "Surplus years": "The expert provided specific information about the five times the budget was balanced in the last 50 years. They mentioned that four of the surplus years occurred from 1998-2001, during President Bill Clinton's last three years in office and President George W. Bush's first year in office. The fifth surplus occurred in 1969 when Richard Nixon was president.", "Historical context": "The expert also highlighted that while a federal surplus is rare in modern history, it has not always been the case. They referenced a 1998 study that found federal surpluses outnumbered deficits prior to 1930, indicating that balancing the budget was more common in earlier years."}
