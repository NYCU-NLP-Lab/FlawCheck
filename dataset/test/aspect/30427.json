{"The claim inaccurately states that Gov": "Scott Walker eliminated \"cancer screenings for uninsured women.\" The contract in question was for assistance in signing up for and receiving the screenings, not the screenings themselves. The screenings were still available through other healthcare providers.", "The claim falsely suggests that Gov": "Walker offered \"no alternatives\" after canceling the contract with Planned Parenthood. However, the change in coordination put the four counties on par with how the program is handled in the majority of the state, where county health departments serve as the local coordinators for the screenings.", "The expert": "s verdict highlights that neither the assistance provided by Planned Parenthood nor the screenings themselves were ever ended. A news release from Planned Parenthood confirmed that both the assistance and the screenings would continue.", "The evidence presented by Rep": "Gwen Moore, including the website articles and tweets, does not support the claim that Gov. Walker eliminated the cancer-screening program for low-income women. The articles and tweets primarily focus on the cancellation of Planned Parenthood's contract, which was related to assistance in signing up for the screenings, not the availability of the screenings themselves."}
