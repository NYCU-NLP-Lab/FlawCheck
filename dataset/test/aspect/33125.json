{"The claim was initially posted on a public Facebook group on May 21": "2020, citing an unnamed insider who stated that South Sudan's First Vice President Riek Machar and his wife, Defence Minister Angelina Teny, were traveling to the United Kingdom for COVID-19 treatment. However, it was later confirmed that Machar and Teny had tested positive for COVID-19 and were self-isolating at home.", "A similar version of the claim": "accompanied by pictures, was posted a few hours later. One of the images showed a jet and a UN-inscribed ambulance on a runway, with health workers appearing to board the plane. The inscription on the ambulance read \"Bye bye Zol kabir,\" which is a term used in Juba Arabic, a South Sudanese colloquial Arabic, to refer to someone important. This image contributed to the spread of the claim on social media.", "Another image circulated with the claim": "showing two stationary aircraft and workers in hazmat suits. However, a reverse image search revealed that this image was part of a series taken by a Reuters photographer on April 5, 2020, at Juba International Airport for an unrelated article. This finding undermined the credibility of the claim.", "The claim was further propagated through various Facebook groups and pages focused on current affairs in South Sudan": "as well as news blogs. Some of these sources reposted the claim with additional images and information. For instance, a Facebook post on May 22, 2020, claimed that South Sudan's President Kiir had been flown to Egypt for medical attention after testing positive for COVID-19. This post included the same image of an aircraft and an ambulance with UN livery as seen in the earlier claims about Machar and his wife. The post also mentioned specific COVID-19 symptoms experienced by the president, adding to the speculation."}
