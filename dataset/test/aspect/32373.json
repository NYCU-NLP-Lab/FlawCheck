{"President Trump": "s claim that \"Obamacare premiums nationwide have increased by double and triple digits\" is based on the fact that premiums for insurance plans on the federal insurance exchange did increase in the past year.", "However": "Trump's claim leaves out the significant fact that he is referring only to premiums for insurance plans on the federal insurance exchange and not everyone who benefitted from the Affordable Care Act.", "The U": "S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) used a benchmark to measure premium increases and found that premiums rose an average of 25 percent across the 39 states that use the HealthCare.gov marketplace.", "While Arizona is the only state where premiums went up by triple digits": "premiums in Indiana actually decreased in 2017. This shows that premium increases varied across different states and that not all states experienced significant increases."}
