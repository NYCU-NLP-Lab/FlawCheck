{"The claim is based on Nick Freitas": "vote on March 3 against legislation that provides job protections for pregnant women and new mothers working for small companies.", "The bill": "which is now law, prohibits small companies from firing, denying promotion, or discriminating against an employee solely because she is pregnant or has a condition related to her pregnancy. It also requires employers to make reasonable accommodations for pregnant workers.", "The bill passed the Senate unanimously and cleared the House on a largely partisan vote": "with 38 of 45 GOP delegates, including Freitas, voting against it.", "Freitas argues that the bill was unnecessary because federal law already protects pregnant workers from job discrimination": "but experts point out that Virginia's law extends protections to women working at companies with 6-14 employees, while federal law only covers companies with 15 or more employees."}
