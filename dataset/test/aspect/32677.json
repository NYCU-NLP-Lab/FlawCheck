{"Reduction in county property tax rate and levy": "The county's approved budgets show a decrease in the property tax rate and levy for residents for the past four consecutive years. However, it is important to note that this does not necessarily mean property taxes have gone down for every resident, as local taxes may have increased in some municipalities.", "Increase in total spending": "Dutchess County spending has increased every year since Marc Molinaro took office. Between his first budget and 2017, total spending increased by approximately 6%. This increase in spending can be attributed, in part, to mandated services whose cost has risen by nearly $3 million since 2015.", "Cuts in county workforce": "Molinaro has approved cuts in the county workforce since becoming the county executive. However, it is unclear how significant these cuts have been and what impact they have had on overall spending.", "Budget comparison": "Comparison of the current budget with the budget from six years ago would provide a clearer understanding of whether Molinaro's claim of a lower budget is accurate. Unfortunately, the information regarding the budget for 2018 is not available yet, so a comprehensive analysis of the budget trend cannot be fully determined."}
