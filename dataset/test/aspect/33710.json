{"The addition of a fresh egg": "One aspect that was employed to verify the authenticity of the claim was the requirement of adding a fresh egg to the cake mix. This change was believed to address the public's unease with a mix that required only water, providing a sense of participatory investment.", "Research on public perception": "Special research was conducted to understand why the initial cake mix, which required only water, was not selling well. This research revealed that the public felt uneasy about the simplicity of the mix and believed they needed to contribute something to the cake-making process.", "Increased sales after the change": "The claim states that immediately after the company changed the formula and required the addition of an egg, the cake mix achieved great success. This aspect, the significant increase in sales, serves as evidence supporting the claim's authenticity.", "Historical debate among food companies": "The expert's verdict highlights that the debate between offering \"complete\" cake mixes with dried eggs or mixes requiring the addition of fresh eggs was not limited to a reaction to disappointing sales. It was a longstanding point of contention among food companies during the development of cake mixes in the 1940s. This historical context adds credibility to the claim."}
