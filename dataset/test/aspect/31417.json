{"The claim is based on a statement made by U": "S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, a Republican from Texas, in a November 22 op-ed piece in the Austin American-Statesman. This serves as the primary source of the claim.", "The claim is supported by a report by Veronique de Rugy": "a senior research fellow at George Mason University's Mercatus Center. The report analyzed contract and grant data reported to Recovery.gov from February through September 2009, which constituted 21 percent of the overall stimulus dollars.", "The report found that the average dollars awarded per Democratic congressional district was": "471,533,539, while the average dollars awarded per Republican district was $260,675,663. This indicates an 81 percent difference in stimulus funds received by Democratic and Republican districts.", "However": "the expert's verdict also mentions that the report overlooks an important factor in stimulus fund distribution, which is the location of the projects. This suggests that the claim may not fully capture all the factors influencing the distribution of stimulus funds."}
