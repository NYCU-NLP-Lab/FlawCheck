{"The expert verified the claim by conducting mathematical calculations based on Exxon Mobil Corp": "s estimated earnings of $41 billion in 2011. By dividing this amount by 365 days in a year and 24 hours in a day, the expert determined that Exxon pocketed nearly $4.7 million every hour.", "The expert also referenced President Barack Obama": "s speech from the Rose Garden, where he stated that the three biggest U.S. oil companies, including Exxon, took home more than $80 billion in profits. This statement provided additional context and support for the claim.", "The expert acknowledged that Exxon Mobil Corp responded to the claim on its blog": "stating that statistics such as by-the-hour profits only tell part of the story. The company highlighted that their taxes were $12.3 million an hour and it took more than $47 million an hour to run the global business. However, the expert focused solely on the claim of Exxon pocketing nearly $4.7 million every hour, disregarding the additional statistics provided by the company.", "The expert mentioned that Politifact Virginia had previously rated a similar claim made by Rep": "Jim Moran, stating that the big five oil companies made a total profit of nearly $1 trillion over the past decade, as Mostly True. This rating provided further evidence to support the claim about Exxon's profits."}
