{"Mischaracterization of COVID": "19 PCR tests: The expert's verdict highlights that the claim is based on a mischaracterization of what COVID-19 PCR tests are meant to indicate. It explains that the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected by the test is not necessarily indicative of being infected or contagious with SARS-CoV-2.", "Fallacy of false positives": "The expert's verdict points out that the claim relies on the fallacy that COVID-19 tests produce high rates of false positives. It clarifies that the limitation of the test is not false positives, but rather that it only detects the presence of specific SARS-CoV-2 RNA.", "Exaggeration of COVID": "19 severity: The expert's verdict explains that the claim suggests that the deadliness or severity of COVID-19 is exaggerated by including flu deaths as COVID-19 deaths. It highlights that this argument is partially rooted in the fallacy of false positives and misinterpretation of Tamiflu prescription data.", "Decreased Tamiflu sales": "The expert's verdict acknowledges that there have been fewer prescriptions for Tamiflu filled during the flu season. However, it emphasizes that this fact can be interpreted in multiple ways and does not necessarily support the claim that false positives for COVID-19 inflate the danger of the pandemic."}
