{"The claim was attributed to a video ad by David Dewhurst": "which was made public on April 16, 2014. The ad stated that Dan Patrick \"got caught not paying his taxes\" and \"pocketed his employees\u2019 payroll taxes.\"", "The claim was prefaced by an excerpt from a lieutenant governor debate in which a reporter mentioned that Patrick had walked away from more than": "800,000 in debts when he declared personal bankruptcy. This debate provided some context for the claims made in the ad.", "The authenticity of the claim was verified by referencing a September 19": "2013, Dallas Morning News story on Patrick's financial troubles. The article confirmed that Patrick had indeed filed for bankruptcy in October 1986 under his birth name, Dannie Scott Goeb, and had owed the Internal Revenue Service $13,186 in federal income taxes withheld from his restaurant employees' paychecks.", "The Quorum Report": "a Capitol newsletter, provided additional evidence to support the claim. They referenced a Dewhurst web page that attributed most of the claims made in the ad to the Dallas Morning News story. This suggests that the information used in the ad was sourced from a reputable news outlet."}
