{"Comparison of Employment in Essential Industries": "The expert analyzed the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data on the number of Pennsylvania workers in each essential industry to compare the employment rates of different socioeconomic classes. This comparison helped verify the claim that the poor are more likely to be employed in essential industries.", "Average Annual Wages": "The expert calculated the average annual wages of workers in essential industries to determine the income levels of those employed in these sectors. The findings showed that the majority of life-sustaining workers earn low and working-class wages, supporting the claim's assertion that the poor are more likely to be employed in essential industries.", "Income Disparity": "The expert highlighted the income disparity among essential workers by revealing that a quarter of Pennsylvania's essential workers earn less than $30,000 annually, and two-thirds earn less than the state's household median income of $60,000. This information further substantiates the claim's argument about the economic divide between the poor and upper-class individuals during the pandemic.", "Vulnerability and Compensation": "The expert provided evidence of the vulnerability of essential workers by citing cases of grocery clerks and other employees who have contracted and died from the coronavirus. Additionally, the mention of new rules implemented by Governor Tom Wolf to prevent the spread of the virus in businesses open to in-person customers indicates efforts to protect and compensate essential workers, indirectly supporting the claim's assertion of insufficient protection and compensation for these workers."}
