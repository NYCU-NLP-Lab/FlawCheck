{"Video analysis": "The expert examined the 15-second viral video of the infant with three eyes and concluded that it was a clear case of video editing. They observed that the eye on the right-hand side of the reader had been superimposed on the forehead of the baby, and both the right eye and the \"third\" eye had the same movement.", "Source investigation": "The expert conducted a reverse image search and discovered that the video was originally posted by a Twitter account with a Chinese caption on July 9th. This finding suggested that the video had originated from a social media account and not from a reliable or verified source.", "Medical knowledge": "The expert referred to medical literature and explained that infants with three eyes can very rarely be born, but it occurs as part of a rare congenital disorder called diprosopus. They clarified that diprosopus is often associated with deformities of the brain, spinal cord, heart, and abdominal organs, and babies with this disorder are usually stillborn. The expert highlighted that such deformities of duplication of body organs do not appear without disfigurement, making the authenticity of the video questionable.", "Comparative evidence": "The expert provided a photograph of a newborn with diprosopus, showcasing the grossly deformed face that results from the duplication of multiple parts of the face. By comparing this photograph with the video of the infant with three eyes, the expert emphasized that the absence of disfigurement in the video raised doubts about its authenticity."}
