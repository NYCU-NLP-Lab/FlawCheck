{"The claim is based on a peer": "reviewed study published in the American Journal of Public Health in 2017, which estimated that approximately 1 in 4 women in the United States had undergone at least one abortion between the ages of 15 and 44.", "The data used in the study were collected in 2014": "making it at least six years old as of 2020. Therefore, there is a possibility that the trend may have changed in the past six years, leading to a potential decline in the lifetime incidence of abortion among women.", "The claim gained traction through viral social media posts and memes": "particularly on platforms like Facebook. The earliest example found dates back to February 2019, but it experienced a revival in October 2020 for unclear reasons.", "While the claim has significant evidentiary backing due to the peer": "reviewed study, it has also been used by those opposing abortion rights. The claim's association with different perspectives highlights the need for critical analysis and the consideration of potential biases when interpreting such statistics."}
