{"The claim specifically mentions": "beating Obama at the Supreme Court, saving coal jobs.\" This aspect refers to the February 2016 decision by five justices of the U.S. Supreme Court to issue a stay that blocked the Clean Power Plan from going into effect. This decision was seen as a victory for the coal industry and is being used to support the claim.", "Patrick Morrisey": "the Republican candidate, was a key player in leading a coalition of 24 states in a lawsuit against the Clean Power Plan. This aspect highlights Morrisey's involvement and leadership in the effort to challenge the plan, further supporting the claim.", "The Supreme Court": "s decision to issue a stay was based on a related case, North Dakota vs. EPA. While Morrisey did not accomplish this singlehandedly, he was widely noted as a leader of the effort and played a significant role in bringing the early rounds of litigation to stop the EPA from finalizing the rule.", "The claim implies that Morrisey": "s actions directly saved coal jobs. While the stay on the Clean Power Plan did provide temporary relief to the coal industry, it is important to note that the plan was officially scrapped under President Donald Trump. Therefore, the claim's assertion of directly saving coal jobs may be subject to interpretation and further analysis."}
