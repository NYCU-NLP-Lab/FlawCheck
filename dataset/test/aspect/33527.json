{"The claim was made by U": "S. Rep. Kathy Castor during an interview on MSNBC's Hardball, where she stated that 70,000 three-year-olds and four-year-olds across America will lose access to the preschool Head Start program. She specifically mentioned that 2,000 of these children would be affected in the state of Florida alone.", "The claim was supported by a letter from U": "S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, written on February 1, which stated that \"up to 70,000 children\" would lose access to Head Start and Early Head Start. The White House also released estimates that indicated 2,700 children in Florida would be affected.", "The estimate of 70": "000 children losing access to Head Start was determined by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) through a formula based on appropriations, past levels of children served, and the cost to serve a child. This number was not based on responses from individual Head Start programs.", "Head Start is an early education program that serves over 1 million children each year": "Enrollment decisions are made at the local level, with multiple groups offering Head Start programs within a single county. Therefore, the exact number of children affected can vary, and claims about the program are estimates. However, the Obama administration had previously increased Head Start enrollment through the economic stimulus, and Congress had allocated additional funding to maintain enrollment levels."}
