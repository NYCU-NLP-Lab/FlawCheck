The campaign argues that it would be difficult to cut Medicaid due to its status as an entitlement program.", "Cuccinelli": "s tax cut plan includes reducing the top personal income tax bracket from 5.75 to 5 percent and the corporate income tax rate from 6 percent to 4 percent. These cuts would lead to a reduction of $1.4 billion in general fund revenues annually after four years. Cuccinelli plans to offset this loss by eliminating tax loopholes and exemptions and limiting new spending increases.", "The average salary and benefits for a teacher in Virginia is": "64,635, according to the VEA. McAuliffe's claim of over 8,000 teacher layoffs is based on the VEA's estimate of a $420 million reduction in education support, which would amount to losing support for approximately 6,530 teachers."}
