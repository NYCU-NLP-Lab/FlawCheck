{"The video clip of dolphins creating and playing with bubble rings has been circulating since at least 2006 and was shared via email before the prominence of social media": "2. The video shows dolphins creating solid, donut-shaped bubble rings about 2-ft across, which do not rise to the surface of the water. The dolphins then pull smaller rings from the larger ones and can produce small rings with a quick flip of their heads.", "The explanation for how dolphins create these silver rings is through the generation of": "air-core vortex rings\" caused by the movement and turning of a dolphin's dorsal fin. Bubbles released from the dolphin's blowhole inject air into the rings, and the energy of the water vortex keeps the bubbles from rising for a few seconds of playtime.", "The phenomenon of dolphins producing and manipulating bubble rings has been observed and described by researchers": "as noted in a 2000 article published in the Journal of Comparative Psychology. Ongoing research into the cognitive capabilities of dolphins has shown their propensity for play behavior with physical objects and with each other."}
