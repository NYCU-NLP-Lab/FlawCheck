{"The analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation": "Joel Griffith, claimed that of the 14 wealthy OECD countries with a wealth tax in 1996, 10 have since abandoned it.", "The Tax Foundation": "a group concerned about tax distortions, provided data on the number of countries with wealth taxes based on analysis from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).", "The OECD data shows 13 countries collected revenues from net wealth taxes in 1996": "but there is a discrepancy between the number of countries when measured in local currency versus as a percentage of GDP.", "The definition and scope of wealth taxes vary among countries": "making it difficult to determine the exact number of countries with wealth taxes. However, reports from respected sources like the Ifo Institute for Economic Research and accounting firms like Ernst and Young and KPMG provide insights into the countries that currently have or had wealth taxes."}
