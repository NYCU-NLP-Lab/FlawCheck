{"The claim implies that disease outbreaks in election years are not natural but the result of a scheme to influence politics": "However, no evidence is provided to support this implication.", "The claim states that disease outbreaks occurred in": "every election year\" since 2004. However, the meme gets the years wrong for several outbreaks, such as SARS in 2004 and swine flu in 2010.", "The claim assumes that": "election year\" refers only to presidential election years, but elections are held at every level of government every year, including special elections and state and local elections.", "The claim suggests a pattern by linking the start of disease outbreaks to the year leading up to an election year": "but this pattern is inconsistent, as seen with the Zika virus starting in 2015 (leading up to the presidential election year of 2016) and the new coronavirus being first reported in 2019 (leading up to the presidential election year of 2020)."}
