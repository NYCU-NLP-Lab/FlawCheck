{"The first aspect employed to verify the authenticity of the claim was the examination of the Facebook post that made the claim": "The post was shared more than 1,500 times and included four pictures as alleged evidence of Buhari's death and burial.", "A reverse image search was conducted on one of the pictures shared in the misleading post": "which claimed to show Buhari on his deathbed. It was found that the photo had been doctored and actually depicted an American man named Walter Williams, who was found alive inside a body bag after being pronounced dead in 2014.", "The other pictures shared in the Facebook post": "claiming to show Buhari's body, were found to be photos of the 2015 funeral for Abubakar Audu, the former governor of Kogi state in central Nigeria. These photos were taken by photojournalist Emmanuel Osodi and were confirmed to be from Audu's burial, not Buhari's.", "The fact": "checking organizations AFP Fact Check and Africa Check have repeatedly debunked claims of Buhari's death in the past. They have checked the claims and found them to be inaccurate. This history of debunking adds to the verification process and strengthens the conclusion that the claim of Buhari's death is not authentic."}
