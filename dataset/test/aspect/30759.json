{"The expert": "s verdict highlights that the claim made by U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio is incorrect and misleading. Rubio stated that a minor cannot get a tattoo without parental consent but can get an abortion without parental consent, implying a disparity in regulations between the two actions.", "The expert notes that laws regarding parental consent for abortion and tattoos vary from state to state": "making it impossible to make a blanket statement applicable to the entire country. This indicates that Rubio's claim oversimplifies the complexity of these laws.", "The expert provides evidence that at least 45 states have laws prohibiting minors from getting tattoos": "with the majority of those states allowing it if there is parental consent. This contradicts Rubio's assertion that a minor can easily get a tattoo without parental consent.", "The expert also mentions that a majority of states require some form of parental involvement": "either consent or notification, for a minor to obtain an abortion. This further refutes Rubio's claim that a minor can easily get an abortion without parental consent."}
