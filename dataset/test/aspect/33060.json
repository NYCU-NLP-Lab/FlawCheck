{"The claim is based on a Facebook ad by the National Republican Senatorial Committee that links Sen": "Bill Nelson and Sen. Elizabeth Warren on single-payer health care.", "The ad quotes Elizabeth Warren saying": "the next step is single payer\" and implies that Sen. Nelson agrees, stating that he votes with Warren 90 percent of the time.", "The ad targets Sen": "Nelson because he faces re-election in 2018 in a state won by President Donald Trump and he is likely to face Republican Gov. Rick Scott, who advocates for repealing the Affordable Care Act.", "Sen": "Nelson's past statements and positions on health care suggest that he opposed a universal, single-payer health care program but supported alternative approaches such as large groups of consumers organized into purchasing units replacing employers as group insurance purchasers."}
