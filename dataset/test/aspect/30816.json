{"Multiple sources reported the claim": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim was reported by the Daily Star, a British tabloid, as well as the Russian newspaper Pravda Report and South Korean media. This indicates that the claim was not based on a single source, increasing the likelihood of its authenticity.", "Video evidence of alarms in Pyongyang": "The expert's verdict mentions a video posted on YouTube showing alarms going off in the streets of Pyongyang. This visual evidence supports the claim of an evacuation taking place in the city.", "Corroboration of tensions between North Korea and the United States": "The expert's verdict mentions that the alleged evacuation was attributed to heightened tensions between North Korea and the United States. This aligns with the known geopolitical situation and the U.S. response of deploying naval strike groups to the region.", "Lack of bomb shelter capacity": "The expert's verdict mentions that Pyongyang's bomb shelters would not be able to accommodate the entire population, necessitating the evacuation of 600,000 people. This practical consideration adds credibility to the claim as it provides a plausible reason for the evacuation."}
