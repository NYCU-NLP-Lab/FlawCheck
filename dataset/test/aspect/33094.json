{"Richard Nixon": "s birth year: The expert points out that Nixon was born in 1913, which would have made him about 15 years old when the Gerber baby food campaign was launched in 1928. This age discrepancy makes it highly unlikely that Nixon could have been the original Gerber Baby.", "Lack of credible sources": "The expert states that they were unable to trace the claim back to any credible source. This suggests that there is no reliable evidence or documentation to support the claim that Nixon was the original Gerber Baby.", "Reference to": "Futurama\" episode: The expert mentions an episode of the animated show \"Futurama\" from 2000, where a character refers to Richard Nixon as the original Gerber baby. However, the expert notes that they are not entirely certain if this is the origin of the claim, but it is the earliest example they have found. This reference to a fictional show further undermines the authenticity of the claim.", "Gerber": "s official statement: The expert cites Gerber Products Company's official statement, which states that the original Gerber Baby logo was based on a drawing of Ann Turner Cook, done by her neighbor Dorothy Hope Smith. This official statement provides concrete evidence that refutes the claim that Nixon was the original Gerber Baby."}
