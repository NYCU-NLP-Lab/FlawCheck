{"Lack of response from the Trump campaign": "The expert reached out to the Trump campaign twice to inquire about the basis of Trump's claim but did not receive a response. This lack of response suggests that the campaign did not provide any specific evidence or sources to support the claim.", "The Washington Times editorial": "The Trump campaign provided a footnote to support the claim, referencing a 2007 editorial in The Washington Times. However, the editorial does not provide any information or data regarding the increase in illegal immigration during Kaine's governorship.", "Pew Hispanic Center figures": "The expert contacted the nonpartisan Pew Hispanic Center, which estimates the size of the illegal immigrant population in each state. According to Pew's figures, the illegal immigrant population in Virginia remained relatively stable during Kaine's tenure, with a slight increase of 25,000 between 2006 and 2010.", "Margin of error in Pew": "s estimates: The expert highlighted that Pew's figures are estimates based on a sample of data collected by the Census Bureau and are subject to rounding. This means that there is a margin of error involved in the estimates, making it difficult to determine an exact figure for the size of the illegal immigrant population."}
