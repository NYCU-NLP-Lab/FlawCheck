{"Little national television news coverage was given to the discovery of thousands of preserved fetal remains found in the garage of Ulrich Klopfer": "an abortionist who had passed away.", "ABC": "NBC, and NPR published web articles about Ulrich Klopfer, and some local affiliates for CBS News and PBS also covered the story.", "The claim made by Life News that ABC": "CBS, NBC, MSNBC, NPR, and PBS refused to cover the discovery of over 2,000 preserved fetuses is not accurate. These outlets did provide coverage, although it may have been limited and not on their television broadcasts.", "The Life News article": "s assertion that these outlets were censoring the truth and failing to mention the abortionist is misleading, as they did cover the story on their websites, even if it received less attention on national television news broadcasts."}
