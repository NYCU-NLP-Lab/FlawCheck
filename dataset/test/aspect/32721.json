{"Johnson": "s votes for Paul Ryan's budget proposals: The expert mentions that Johnson's claim was backed by his votes for Ryan's budget proposals, which included Medicare reforms. These budgets, although they did not become law, prompted Democrats to argue that Ryan wanted to turn Medicare into a voucher program.", "Use of the term": "premium supports\" by Republicans: The expert highlights that there is some argument over semantics between the terms \"voucher\" and \"premium supports.\" While Democrats claim that Johnson voted to turn Medicare into a voucher program, Republicans prefer the term premium supports. This difference in terminology adds complexity to the authenticity of the claim.", "Changes in Medicare payment system": "The expert explains that under the initial Ryan plan, Medicare would have changed from a fee-for-service system to one where beneficiaries would receive a fixed subsidy to use towards private insurance premiums. This change would have affected individuals under the age of 55 at the time.", "Emphasis on payments to insurance companies": "Johnson's campaign argues that the proposed change wouldn't be a voucher system and highlights that the premium support payments would be made to insurance companies, not directly to Medicare beneficiaries themselves. This aspect emphasizes the potential shift in how Medicare payments are allocated and managed."}
