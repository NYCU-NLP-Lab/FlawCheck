{"The claim made by Sen": "Bernie Sanders that \"One out of four corporations doesn't pay a nickel in taxes\" was based on a Government Accountability Office (GAO) study from 2008. The GAO study found that for large U.S.-controlled corporations, one out of four paid no federal income taxes.", "The GAO study specifically focused on large corporations with at least": "250 million in assets or $50 million in gross receipts. It found that 80 percent of these large corporations reported no income after deducting salaries, wages, and other expenses, which resulted in their taxable income being reduced to zero.", "The GAO study also highlighted that the category of corporations not paying taxes included both those that failed to turn a profit and those that were profitable but utilized various loopholes and deductions in the tax code to avoid paying taxes": "4. Another research group, Citizens for Tax Justice, conducted a study on corporate tax payments and suggested that the one-in-four statistic might be less significant than it initially appears. Their study found that out of 500 corporations, 220 did not meet the standards of large corporations set by the GAO, indicating that a significant portion of corporations paying no taxes may be smaller businesses rather than large corporations."}
