{"The expert mentions that the claim was based on a chart shared by someone on Facebook": "which showed 24 mass shootings under President Barack Obama and four shootings under President Donald Trump. This aspect verifies that the claim was based on a specific piece of information.", "The expert points out that the chart used data from an LA Times timeline published in October 2017": "which means it only reflects less than half of Trump's time in office. This aspect verifies that the data used in the claim is outdated and does not provide a comprehensive comparison.", "The expert mentions that the chart itself is flawed because it implies a degree of consistency and comprehensiveness that the LA Times did not intend": "The article did not define any criteria for inclusion aside from a sentence at the top. This aspect verifies that the chart used in the claim lacks proper methodology and criteria for including mass shootings.", "The expert highlights the different definitions of a mass shooting used by various sources": "such as the U.S. Justice Department, The Washington Post, Mother Jones, and the Gun Violence Archive. This aspect verifies that there is no universally agreed-upon definition of a mass shooting, which can lead to different tallies and interpretations of the data."}
