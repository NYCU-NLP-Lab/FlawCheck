{"The claim was made by Sen": "Mark Warner, a Democratic senator from Virginia, during an interview on CNBC and in a speech to the New America Foundation. This establishes the source of the claim.", "The claim was supported by various articles in publications such as The Washington Post": "National Journal, and Wired, which were provided by Rachel Cohen, Sen. Warner's spokeswoman. These articles were cited as evidence for the 75 percent statistic.", "However": "upon further investigation, it was found that none of the materials identified the original source of the figures and the source couldn't be found independently. This raises doubts about the accuracy and authenticity of the claim.", "Analysis of data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics": "BLS) and projections by The Wall Street Journal revealed that the 75 percent claim is not supported. The BLS projected that millennials and the following generation would only make up 56 percent of the workforce in 2025, far below the claimed 75 percent.
