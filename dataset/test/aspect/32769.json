{"California verified signatures for mail": "in ballots cast in the 2020 election. Officials in the state\u2019s 58 counties were required by law to check the signature on each voter\u2019s ballot envelope against the signature from that person\u2019s voter registration.", "The same law that requires signatures for vote": "by-mail ballots also applies to recall petitions like the one circulating in an effort to replace Gov. Gavin Newsom.", "Several election officials": "experts, journalists, and fact-checkers debunked false claims made by actor Kevin Sorbo and Republican Buzz Patterson that vote-by-mail signatures were not verified during last year\u2019s general election.", "For a vote": "by-mail ballot to count in California, the voter must sign the outside of their ballot\u2019s envelope before they return it. California election law then requires officials in all 58 counties to verify the signatures on the envelope using the voter\u2019s signature on file, which is the one provided when a person registers to vote. The same law requires officials to cross-check recall petition signatures with the signature on a voter registration record."}
