{"The claim is based on a study conducted by Fight Crime": "Invest in Kids, a Washington, D.C.-based anti-crime organization. The study states that \"in the hour after the school bell rings \u2026 violent juvenile crime suddenly triples\" and \"on school days, the prime time for violent juvenile crime is from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m.\"", "The study used data from a 1997 study by the National Center for Juvenile Justice": "which analyzed the FBI's National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) data from 1991 to 1993. However, it should be noted that the data for those years came from eight states, not specifically New Jersey, and included all offenders younger than 18.", "New Jersey does not participate in the NIBRS": "and the state police do not specifically distinguish juvenile crimes by the time they occurred. This means that there is no specific data available for New Jersey to verify the claim.", "Despite the outdated nature of the data used in the study": "the overall point of the claim is considered sound by the expert. The expert acknowledges that while the statistic comes from data nearly two decades old, it still supports the argument that after-school programs can help prevent juvenile crime and keep children out of trouble."}
