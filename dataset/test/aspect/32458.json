{"The Facebook post falsely claims that a federal judge ordered Wisconsin to have all ballots counted by 8 p": "m. on the day of the election.", "The post fails to provide the name of the judge who supposedly issued this ruling": "indicating that there is no such ruling.", "In reality": "a federal judge's ruling, upheld by an appeals panel, extends the period for counting absentee ballots by nearly a week.", "Wisconsin state law does not allow election clerks to begin counting ballots until Election Day": "making it practically impossible to count all votes by 8 p.m. on Election Day."}
