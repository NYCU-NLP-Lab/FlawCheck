{"Comparison of employment and GDP growth rates": "The expert analyzed the compound annual growth rates for employment and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in Illinois compared to five other states with graduated income taxes (California, New York, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Iowa). The data showed that these states outperformed Illinois in terms of economic growth and employment.", "Use of federal sources": "The expert used data from reputable federal sources, namely the Bureau of Economic Analysis and the Bureau of Labor Statistics, to support their analysis. These sources provide reliable and objective information on economic indicators.", "Limited sample size": "While the expert's analysis focused on five specific states with graduated income taxes, it was acknowledged that this was a small sampling and not representative of all 50 states. This highlights the need for a more comprehensive analysis to draw accurate conclusions.", "Comparison with flat": "tax states: The expert pointed out that the claim made by Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker ignored the fact that most of the flat-tax states also had higher growth rates for GDP compared to Illinois. This suggests that the presence of a graduated income tax alone may not be the sole determining factor for economic growth and job creation."}
