{"Memes or clickbait articles that claim to show color pictures of the Statue of Liberty as it existed when it was first constructed": "in the pre-color photography era of 1886) are typically artificially colorized.", "The current color of Lady Liberty was not her original color": "and oxidation reactions are responsible for her current greenish appearance.", "The Statue of Liberty was constructed with sheets of copper": "which gave it a copper-colored (dull brown) appearance when it was unveiled in 1886.", "Over time": "copper reacts with oxygen and other chemicals in the air, leading to the formation of a thin, green-blue layer known as a \"patina\" on the statue's surface. This patina not only changed the color of the statue but also served as a natural protective layer against further corrosion."}
