{"The claim was not reported by credible news sources": "The expert notes that the claim about African people being genetically resistant to the coronavirus was not reported by major news outlets or reputable sources. Instead, it was found exclusively in viral social media posts and junk sites, indicating a lack of credibility.", "Lack of scientific evidence": "The expert emphasizes that if the claim were true, it would have been a major news story and supported by scientific evidence. However, there is no scientific research or studies cited to back up the claim, further questioning its authenticity.", "Contradictory information": "The expert highlights the case of Kem Senou Pavel Daryl, a Cameroonian student who contracted the coronavirus in China. While he did recover from the illness, it was not due to any genetic resistance but rather medical treatment, including antibiotics and isolation. This contradicts the claim that African people are genetically resistant to the virus.", "Official health organizations": "stance: The expert references the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which states that anyone who comes into close contact with an infected person is at risk of contracting the coronavirus. This contradicts the claim that African people have genetic resistance to the virus, as it suggests that everyone is equally susceptible to infection."}
