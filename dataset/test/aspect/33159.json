{"The date and origin of the photographs": "The expert mentions that the photographs were first uploaded to Reddit's WTF subreddit on 7 March 2014. This information helps verify that the images have been circulating on the internet for some time.", "The initial claim and subsequent addition": "The expert notes that the claim of the dolphin's death due to urination in its blowhole was a recently added element. This suggests that the original claim did not include this specific cause of death, indicating a possible exaggeration or misinformation.", "Lack of evidence supporting the claim": "The expert mentions that the Reddit thread discussing the photographs did not provide any solid information about the origin or authenticity of the pictures. Additionally, a Peruvian news report from 5 March 2014, which was shared in the thread, lacked substantial background information and was speculative in nature. This lack of concrete evidence casts doubt on the claim's authenticity.", "Identification of the individuals depicted": "The expert states that a news article from 16 May 2015 identified the individuals in the photographs as \"tourists\" but provided no additional information about the story behind the images. While this identification adds some credibility to the claim, the lack of further details raises questions about the veracity of the incident."}
