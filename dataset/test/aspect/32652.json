{"The initial claim was made in a tweet on December 9": "2018, stating that the parliament had passed a law allowing King Mswati to marry 14-year-old virgins. This tweet was retweeted by Dewa Mavhinga, Southern Africa director of Human Rights Watch, who expressed the need for further investigation.", "The claim was also shared in various versions on social media platforms": "including Facebook and Twitter, with different wording and levels of engagement. One version falsely claimed that the age of the king's potential wives needed to be reduced from 17-year-olds to 14-year-olds, based on the assumption that girls become sexually active at the age of 15.", "Slindele Nxumalo": "Communications & Advocacy Officer for the NGO Swaziland Action Group Against Abuse, confirmed that such a law does not exist in eSwatini. She stated that there are actually two laws, the Child Protection Welfare Act of 2012 and the Sexual Offences and Domestic Violence Act of 2018, which protect and promote the health and safety of every child in eSwatini.", "The eSwatini government spokesman": "Percy Simelane, dismissed the claim as \"lunacy\" and refused to entertain it. Sibonsile Mamba, a director of Swaziland Women in Action, acknowledged the possibility of such a marriage due to the king's elevated status above the law, but stated that there would be no legal measures that could be taken against him."}
