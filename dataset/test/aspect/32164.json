{"The meme falsely claims that Kamala Harris": "wasn't in Berkeley during segregation...she was in school in Canada at that time.\" However, Harris has spoken about her experience being bused to school in Berkeley as part of the school's integration efforts.", "Harris attended Thousand Oaks Elementary School starting in 1970": "according to her campaign. Although there are no pre-digital records showing the students who attended the school at that time, the Berkeley Public Schools district has no reason to doubt Harris' account or the accounts of others who attended school with her.", "The district implemented an innovative two": "way busing plan in 1968 to integrate all Berkeley elementary schools. Harris joined the first grade in 1970, which means she joined a cohort that had entered kindergarten in the second year of the busing program, in 1969.", "A photo of Harris": "class at Thousand Oaks Elementary School was published in her book, \"The Truths We Hold,\" further supporting her account of attending school in Berkeley during the integration efforts."}
