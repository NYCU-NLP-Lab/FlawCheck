{"Rhode Island is not one of the first states to pass a voter ID bill": "The expert's verdict states that at least a dozen states had enacted voter ID laws earlier than Rhode Island, making it closer to the middle of the pack rather than being one of the first.", "Voter ID laws are not a Republican scheme": "The expert's verdict mentions that conservative pundit Ann Coulter used Rhode Island's voter ID law to counter the accusation that such legislation is a Republican scheme to suppress Democratic votes. This suggests that voter ID laws are not solely pushed by Republicans but can also be supported by Democrats.", "Rhode Island": "s voter ID law is not unique or exceptional: The expert's verdict mentions that Rhode Island, with its 83.5 percent Democratic legislators, is an exception to the national trend on voter ID laws. However, it also highlights that Connecticut had implemented a voter ID requirement in 1993, and at least 31 states had enacted some form of voter ID law by 2012. This suggests that Rhode Island's law is not unique or groundbreaking in comparison to other states."}
