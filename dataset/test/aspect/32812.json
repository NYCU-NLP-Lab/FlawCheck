{"Lack of independent corroboration": "The expert found no independent evidence or sources to support the claim that Jim Mattis made the criticized remarks about \"pantyhose-wearing\" politicians. This suggests that the authenticity of the claim is questionable.", "Previous record of the source": "The source of the claim, \"Mad World News,\" is known for posting misleading and inaccurate stories, particularly about Muslims. The expert highlights this as a factor that raises doubts about the credibility of the quotation.", "Absence of citation or date in the meme": "The meme containing the alleged quotation does not provide any specific citation or date for when Mattis supposedly made the remarks. This lack of specific information further undermines the credibility of the claim.", "Expert": "s opinion: The expert's overall verdict is that it is not clear whether Mattis ever made the criticized remarks, but it is highly unlikely. The absence of any supporting evidence, combined with the questionable credibility of the source, strongly suggests that the quotation is fabricated."}
