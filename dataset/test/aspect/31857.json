{"The claim of 100": "infant mortality among orca whales was based on fear-mongering articles and clickbait titles that circulated online for several years.", "The sources cited in the articles": "such as Humans Are Free and Natural News, have a reputation for being disreputable and misleading.", "There is no proven connection between the Fukushima nuclear disaster and the mortality of infant orcas": "The claim cannot be ruled out as a possibility, but it lacks definitive evidence.", "Quotes from Ken Balcomb": "the executive director of the Center for Whale Research, were taken out of context and misrepresented to support the claim, when in fact, Balcomb's statements did not provide evidence of a direct link between the Fukushima disaster and orca mortality."}
