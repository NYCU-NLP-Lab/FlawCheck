{"The voting record of top Democrats in 2006": "The expert points out that White House budget director Mick Mulvaney referenced the votes of then-Senator Obama, Sen. Schumer, and Sen. Clinton in 2006 to support the claim. He states that they all voted for an act that authorized a fence along certain stretches of the border.", "The Secure Fence Act of 2006": "The expert mentions that the act, passed by a Republican Congress and signed by President George W. Bush, authorized approximately 700 miles of fencing along specific areas of the US-Mexico border. This act is cited as evidence of the Democrats' support for a physical barrier.", "Amendment to the act": "The expert notes that the original act called for at least two layers of reinforced fencing, but this requirement was amended later through the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2008. The amendment eliminated the double-layer requirement, highlighting a difference between the 2006 fence and the wall proposal.", "Differences between the fence and Trump": "s wall proposal: The expert acknowledges that while the terms \"wall\" and \"fence\" may have some semantic differences, both are intended to block people. However, the expert also highlights the obvious differences between the 2006 fence, described as \"rust-colored thick bars\" with gaps and openings, and Trump's proposed wall, which would be made of precast concrete and rise to various heights."}
