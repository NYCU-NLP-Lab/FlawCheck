{"The claim is supported by a statement from Texas Governor Greg Abbott": "who states that federal law now regulates down to the tenth of an inch the minimum size of fish that anglers can keep.", "The claim is further supported by a federal case brought against a Florida fisherman in 2007": "where a federal law providing minimum length limits for certain kinds of fish caught in ocean waters was cited.", "The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department confirms that Texas maintains its own regulations on minimum fish lengths for catches in public waters": "indicating that federal regulations may not apply to everyone who fishes in Texas.", "The claim is reinforced by the fact that no length regulations apply to fish caught in waters wholly on private lands": "as stated by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department."}
