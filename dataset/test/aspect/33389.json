{"The claim made by U": "S. Rep. Rob Wittman during a radio interview that there have been more subpoenas issued by the House majority than bills passed.", "The Washington Times article from October 22": "which reported that House Democrats have issued 56 subpoenas while passing only 46 bills that became laws.", "The clarification from Wittman": "s director of communications, Kathleen Gayle, stating that the congressman misspoke and meant to emphasize that House Democrats have issued more subpoenas than bills signed into law.", "The response from experts who stated that comparing subpoenas with House bills enacted into law is misleading": "as issuing a subpoena is easier than passing legislation due to additional hurdles involved."}
