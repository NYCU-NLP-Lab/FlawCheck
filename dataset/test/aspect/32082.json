{"The claim originated from a 20": "year-old educational feature on NASA's Earth Observatory website, which discussed the Milankovitch Climate Theory and its correlation to natural climate changes caused by variations in Earth's solar orbit and axial tilt.", "The claim was propagated by radio personality Hal Turner on August 8": "2019, during a segment where he presented the information from NASA's Earth Observatory as if it was a recent admission from NASA.", "The story gained further virality when it was picked up by the website Natural News": "which promoted a specific brand of climate-change denial and presented the information as evidence against anthropogenic climate change.", "The experts point out that while climate scientists acknowledge natural causes of variation in the climate system": "this does not negate the evidence for anthropogenic changes. The claim misrepresents the scientific consensus and creates a straw-man argument by suggesting that natural climate variability disproves human influence on climate change."}
