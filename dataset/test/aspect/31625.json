{"The report from the Ocean State Policy Research Institute": "OSPRI) asserts that the estate tax is the most significant driver of out-migration from Rhode Island. This claim is based on their analysis of policy issues and their understanding of free enterprise, limited government, and traditional American values.", "The report highlights the fact that Florida": "a state with no estate tax, is the number one destination for former Rhode Island residents. This suggests a correlation between the absence of an estate tax and the decision to relocate to Florida.", "Alan Hassenfeld": "a board member and former CEO of Hasbro, funded the OSPRI report and claims to personally know high-income individuals who have left Rhode Island due to the estate tax. This adds anecdotal evidence to support the claim.", "The OSPRI report also presents data on the financial impact of the estate tax on Rhode Island": "It states that the state lost $540 million in other state and local taxes because people left Rhode Island, while only collecting $341.3 million from the estate tax between 1995 and 2007. This suggests a potential negative economic consequence of the estate tax."}
