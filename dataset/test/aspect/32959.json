{"The claim is based on a statement made by Upendra Chivukula": "a Democratic state Assemblyman who is running against Leonard Lance in the election.", "The claim references the Project Vote Smart website": "which allegedly shows that Lance was not for guns in 2008.", "The expert": "s investigation found that Lance did vote to repeal the ban on visitors possessing firearms on federal public land in 2009, indicating his support for carrying concealed weapons in national parks.", "The expert also found a survey from Project Vote Smart in 2007": "where Lance indicated his support for maintaining and strengthening the enforcement of existing state restrictions on the purchase and possession of guns. However, this does not prove that Lance was \"not for guns,\" but rather that he supported enforcing New Jersey's current laws."}
