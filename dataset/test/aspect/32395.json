{"The use of forced perspective": "The expert's verdict confirms that forced perspective was employed to make the Snow White figurine appear taller than the seven dwarves. This technique involved building each successive level at a smaller scale, creating the illusion of height.", "John Hench": "s ingenious solution: John Hench, a Disney Imagineer, came up with an ingenious and elegant solution to the problem of the statues all arriving at the same height. By placing Snow White high atop the grotto, she appeared to be the proper size in relation to the dwarves.", "Addition of other figures": "To further enhance the forced perspective effect, John Hench had figures made of various birds, deer, and bunnies. These additional figures added depth and contributed to the illusion of Snow White being taller than the dwarves.", "Replacement of marble figurines": "The original marble figurines, which were all the same height, were eventually replaced with fiberglass replicas. This change allowed for greater control over the proportions and ensured that Snow White appeared taller than the dwarves."}
