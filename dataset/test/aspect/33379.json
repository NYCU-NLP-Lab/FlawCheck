{"The claim was made by Rachel Siegel": "the executive director of the Peace and Justice Center, who sent out an email titled \"Action Alert: Stop Nuclear bombers coming to Vermont!\" stating that the F-35 bombers scheduled to arrive in Burlington have been designated with a nuclear mission.", "The Vermont National Guard": "represented by Capt. Mikel Arcovitch, stated that the F-35 jets arriving in Burlington will not be nuclear capable and there are no plans to add the hardware to make them nuclear capable.", "Retired Col": "Rosanne Greco, who has been involved in the fight against F-35s in Vermont, acknowledged that Siegel's message could be easily misread but stated that F-35 bombers are indeed coming to Burlington and F-35s do have a nuclear mission.", "The expert": "s own investigation in June 2018 revealed that no F-35 squadrons had been given a nuclear mission, and the information about whether Burlington could be assigned such a mission was uncertain at that time. However, the expert questions if something has changed since then."}
