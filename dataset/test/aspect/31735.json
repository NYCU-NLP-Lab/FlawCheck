{"Lack of credible sources": "The expert's verdict highlights that the claim was spread by fake news sites such as The Last Line of Defense, Info Media, and Popular News Today. These sites are known for publishing false information and are not considered reliable sources of news.", "Inconsistencies in the story": "The expert points out that the original fake news article claimed that Malia Obama was among 10 arrested in a racist Antifa attack, while another fake article added the twist that the arresting officer was found dead. These inconsistencies raise doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Contradiction with official records": "The Cambridge Police Department's daily log and News & Alerts page do not mention any incident involving 10 assailants, Antifa, or the names mentioned in the fake news article. This contradiction with official records further discredits the claim.", "Misuse of images": "The photo of the police officer used in the fake news article is not a picture of Officer Patrick Farley, as claimed, but a photo of Brad Miller, a former police officer from Arlington, Texas. This misuse of images undermines the credibility of the claim."}
