{"Lack of evidence": "The expert's verdict states that there is no evidence to support the claim that a terrorist attacked the Trumps at Mar-a-Lago. This lack of evidence undermines the authenticity of the claim.", "FBI involvement": "The FBI, which handles terrorism investigations, is not involved in the incident. This suggests that the incident is not being considered a terrorist threat, further casting doubt on the claim.", "Location discrepancy": "The incident did not occur at Mar-a-Lago, Trump's private club, but at the Trump International Golf Club, which is located a 15-minute drive away. This inconsistency in the location raises questions about the accuracy of the claim.", "Source credibility": "The claim originated from a website called Daily Vine, which is related to Freedom Daily, a prolific creator of ultra right-wing stories that has since shut down. The lack of credibility of the source raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim."}
