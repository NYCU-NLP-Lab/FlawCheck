It was not a current or official forecast.", "The graphic contained a black mark that misleadingly showed the storm": "s projected path heading deep into Alabama, which contradicted the official forecasts and caused confusion.", "The black mark on the graphic was added and not a part of the original forecast": "raising questions about why it was included and who made the alteration.", "The White House has not yet provided answers to questions about why the black mark was drawn on the map and why President Trump chose to display an outdated graphic instead of a current one": "This lack of response adds to the suspicion surrounding the authenticity of the claim."}
