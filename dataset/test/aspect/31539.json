{"The video posted by White House Deputy Chief of Staff for Communications and Director of Social Media Dan Scavino was manipulated and not a genuine video of Joe Biden falling asleep during a live television interview": "2. The manipulated video was a mashup that combined a 2011 clip of singer Harry Belafonte and a misleading clip of Biden during the 2020 Democratic National Convention.", "The clip of Belafonte falling asleep was from an appearance he made on a California television station in 2011": "and it was later clarified that his \"nap\" was due to a technical glitch with his earpiece.", "The clip of Biden used in the manipulated footage was from the moment during the 2020 Democratic National Convention when Hillary Clinton endorsed him for president": "In the original footage, it is clear that Biden was never actually asleep."}
