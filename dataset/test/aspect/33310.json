{"The claim is supported by a weblink from a prominent education foundation": "the Broad Foundation, which compared America's top math students with top math students in other nations. The foundation's page provides rankings from a 2006 study of students for the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA), which examines the academic performance of 15-year-old students in math, reading, and science in more than 60 nations.", "The PISA assessment is conducted by an international contractor that randomly selects schools to take the exam": "The selection of schools and students is said to be as inclusive as possible, ensuring a representative sample of students from each participating country.", "The 2009 PISA exam": "which included 5,233 U.S. students, is the most recent assessment available for comparison. Although the claim refers to \"recent international reports,\" the specific timeframe is not clearly defined.", "The claim": "s accuracy is limited to the comparison of the United States with other industrialized nations. The expert's verdict does not provide information on the specific ranking of the United States among these nations or the extent of its academic achievement compared to other countries."}
