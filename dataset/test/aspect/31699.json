{"The claim originated from multiple web sites reporting on a study published in 2015": "which examined octopus DNA and concluded that it was either \"alien\" or \"from space.\"", "The study published in the journal Nature stated that octopuses have a genome with an unprecedented level of complexity": "consisting of 33,000 protein-coding genes, surpassing the number found in a human being.", "The research highlighted the unique characteristics of octopuses": "such as their eight prehensile arms, large brain, and problem-solving abilities, which set them apart from all other animals and even other molluscs.", "The expert": "s verdict emphasized that while the study did not assert extraterrestrial origins for the octopus, there was evidence of substantial expansion of specific gene families and extensive remodeling of genome linkage and repetitive content, contributing to the evolution of cephalopod morphological innovations, including their complex nervous systems."}
