{"Grayson": "s statement: U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson claimed that Florida would become a majority minority state in the current year, stating that it was an important development for the Democratic Party's strategy in the upcoming 2014 election.", "Census data": "The evidence provided by Grayson's office from the census showed that the percentage of non-Hispanic whites in Florida has decreased since 2000. However, the data did not prove that Florida was on track to become majority minority in 2014.", "Comparison with other states": "Grayson mentioned that Florida would join states like New Mexico, Arizona, Texas, California, and Hawaii as majority minority states. Census data showed that these states had higher percentages of minority populations, with Hawaii being 77.2 percent minority, California being 60.6 percent, New Mexico being 60.2 percent, and Texas being 55.5 percent.", "University study": "To assess future projections, a 2013 study from the University of Florida's Bureau of Economic and Business Research was consulted. The study provided statewide projections for the non-Hispanic white population percentage through 2040, indicating a gradual decline from 57 percent in 2015. However, it did not specifically confirm Florida's transition to majority minority in 2014."}
