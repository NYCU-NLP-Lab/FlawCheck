{"Tax credit for hiring convicted felons": "The claim states that there is a tax credit of $2,400 for employers who hire convicted felons. The expert's verdict does not explicitly address this aspect, so it remains unclear whether this tax credit exists or not.", "Federal bonding program": "The claim states that employers can receive $5,000 to $25,000 in federal money through a bonding program for hiring convicted felons. The expert's verdict does not provide any information about this aspect, so it is difficult to determine the authenticity of this claim.", "Federal grants for felons to set up their own small businesses": "The claim suggests that there are federal grants available specifically for ex-convicts to start their own small businesses. However, the expert's verdict states that the first website linked by the expert explicitly states that there are no grants set up to help felons start their own businesses. Therefore, it can be concluded that this aspect of the claim is not authentic.", "Opposition to the proposal": "The expert's verdict includes a statement from Carolyn Medeiros, executive director of the Alliance for Safe Communities, expressing opposition to the proposal of prohibiting employers from asking job applicants about their criminal history. While this aspect does not directly verify the authenticity of the claim, it provides context and perspective on the issue being discussed."}
