{"McCain": "s Senate floor speeches: The expert analyzes McCain's speeches made before casting his vote on the tax cuts. In both cases, McCain expressed regret that the bills would disproportionately benefit wealthier Americans and voiced his concern for middle-class Americans who needed tax relief. This aspect confirms that McCain did raise concerns about the tax cuts benefiting only the rich.", "Comparison with other Republicans": "The expert notes that McCain was one of only two Republicans to oppose the 2001 tax cut bill and one of three Republicans to oppose the 2003 bill. This aspect highlights that McCain's stance was not in line with the majority of his party, further supporting the claim that he voted against the tax cuts based on his belief that they primarily benefited the rich."}
