{"Analysis of historical data": "The expert analyzed historical data on job creation patterns dating back to 1970 to determine the typical range of job creation during a recovery period. This involved examining the net monthly change in total jobs and considering non-recessionary periods as defined by the National Bureau of Economic Research.", "Comparison to normal recovery": "The expert compared the claim made by Mitt Romney that 500,000 jobs should be created per month during a recovery to the historical data analysis. By looking at the percentage of months that fell within different job creation ranges, the expert concluded that creating 500,000 jobs in a month is not a normal occurrence during a recovery.", "Exclusion of current recovery": "To ensure accuracy in the analysis, the expert excluded the current recovery period from the data. This was done to focus solely on historical patterns and avoid any potential bias or influence from the current economic situation.", "Lack of response from Romney campaign": "The expert noted that the Romney campaign did not respond to an inquiry for this story, indicating that their perspective or additional information was not taken into account in the analysis. This suggests that the expert's verdict is based solely on the available data and their own interpretation of it."}
