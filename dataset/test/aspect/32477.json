{"The trade deficit in goods was higher under Trump in 2018 and 2019 than during any previous year": "though that was not the case in 2017.", "The substantial trade surplus in services should be factored in": "as it affects the overall trade deficit. When services are considered, the overall trade deficit was larger in five separate years during George W. Bush's administration than it has been under Trump.", "The United States has had a persistently high trade deficit in goods": "but a growing surplus in services. When the deficit in goods and services is combined, it tends to be smaller than the deficit in goods alone.", "If the deficit in goods alone is considered": "Biden's claim is correct as the U.S. goods deficit was larger in 2018 and 2019 than in any previous year. However, when the deficit in goods and services is taken into account, Biden's statement is incorrect as the deficit was larger under Bush in 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, and 2008 than in any year under Trump."}
