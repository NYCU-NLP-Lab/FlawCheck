They compared the per capita infection rates in these counties with other counties in the state to determine their ranking.", "Comparison with other counties": "The expert contrasted the infection rates in Allegany, Cattaraugus, and Chautauqua counties with the rates in Erie and Niagara counties, which are located in western New York as well. They found that the latter two counties consistently had higher infection rates per capita.", "Regional approach to reopening": "The expert considered the regional approach to reopening implemented by New York state. They noted that the three rural counties mentioned in the claim were geographically linked to more hard-hit counties, which affected their ability to meet the metrics for reopening.", "Examination of official data": "To verify the claim, the expert used the county-by-county infection tallies posted on Gov.
