{"Lack of supporting evidence": "The expert notes that the original source, Mysterious Universe, failed to provide crucial details such as the names of the archaeologists, secondary photos of the tablet, comments from the team, and the object's dimensions. This lack of supporting evidence raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Wild speculation": "Mysterious Universe added wild speculation about the object, suggesting a controversial theory proposed by author Zecharia Sitchin about aliens known as the Anunnaki introducing modern technology to the Sumerian civilization. This speculative element further undermines the credibility of the claim.", "Creation by a German sculptor": "The expert reveals that the \"alien cellphone\" was actually created by a German sculptor named Karin and Karl Weing\u00e4rtner of the Art Replik Studio in January 2012. This information establishes that the object is not ancient and was made relatively recently.", "Indications of a joke or marketing tool": "The expert points out several indications that the post about the \"alien cellphone\" was likely a joke or a marketing tool. These indications include the title of the object (\"BablyoNokia\"), comments on the photograph, and the watermark of the Art Replik Studio. These factors suggest that the claim was not meant to be taken seriously."}
