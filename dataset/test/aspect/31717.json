{"The claim is based on a political mailer from the Service Employees International Union": "SEIU), a union that represents service workers. This mailer states that Republicans support tax breaks for corporations that send jobs overseas.", "The claim is supported by the fact that some Democrats have expressed concern about deductions for business costs that allow companies to deduct the expenses associated with moving jobs overseas": "Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat, has stated that companies can currently take a tax deduction for the costs of moving jobs to other countries.", "PolitiFact Rhode Island has fact": "checked Senator Whitehouse's statement and ruled it as true. They found that businesses can indeed deduct the costs of closing a factory in the United States and moving jobs overseas as standard business expenses.", "The claim is also supported by the fact that there have been discussions and proposed legislation to change the rules regarding deductions for offshoring": "Senator Whitehouse has supported legislation to disallow exemptions associated with offshoring, but the bill failed to pass in the Senate with Republicans voting against it. This suggests that there is some level of support for the claim among Democrats."}
