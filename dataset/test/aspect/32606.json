{"Lack of direct supporting studies": "The expert's verdict highlights that no studies, published or otherwise, were found that directly support the claim made by Gov. Nathan Deal regarding the change in the percentage of high school students staying in Georgia after the implementation of the HOPE scholarship.", "Use of credible officials": "statements: The expert notes that a string of credible officials, including Gov. Deal, have used similar factoids or statements regarding the impact of the HOPE scholarship on college enrollment. These statements have been reported in multiple news outlets, suggesting a level of credibility but not confirming the specific claim.", "Reference to a peer": "reviewed study: In response to the inquiry, Gov. Deal's office provided a peer-reviewed study published in 2006 in the Journal of Labor Economics. However, the study did not conclude that the percentage of students scoring 1400 or above on the SAT has increased. Instead, it referred readers to a statement made by then-Gov. Roy Barnes in an October 2000 Athens Banner-Herald article.", "Indication of a": "ring of truth\": While no direct supporting evidence was found, the expert's verdict acknowledges that the claim made by Gov. Deal has a \"ring of truth\" based on available data. This suggests that there may be some validity to the claim, although it cannot be definitively verified without more specific evidence."}
