{"Taylor Swift stated in an August 2019 interview that she is": "pro-choice\" and expressed her dismay at proposals to tighten restrictions on abortion in Tennessee. However, she did not specifically say \"I support abortion\" or mention anything about \"people wanting to protect unborn children.\"", "The claim that Taylor Swift": "supports abortion\" and finds it hard to believe \"people want to protect unborn children\" originated from an article published by the pro-life website LifeNews in October 2019. The article distorted Swift's exact words but fundamentally gave an accurate description of her professed viewpoint on abortion and legislative efforts to curtail access to it in some U.S. states.", "The headline of the LifeNews article": "which was widely shared on Facebook, proclaimed \"Taylor Swift: 'Obviously' I Support Abortion. 'Can't Believe' People Want to Protect Unborn Children.\" This headline misrepresented Swift's actual statements and exaggerated her stance on the issue.", "In an interview with The Guardian": "published on August 24, 2019, Swift discussed her views on politics, the 2016 election, and the state of society in the United States. While she expressed frustration with certain political tactics and emphasized the importance of democracy, she did not explicitly endorse or support abortion in the interview."}
