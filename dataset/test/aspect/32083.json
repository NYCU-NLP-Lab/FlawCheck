{"The comparison made in the claim": "The expert highlights that the claim compares \"black Americans\" with only white men, while the Pew report actually compares black men with white men. This distinction is important as it affects the accuracy of the claim.", "Data source and methodology": "The expert mentions that the Pew report, which is the source of the claim, uses 2015 data and calculates the median hourly earnings for each race. However, it does not take into account factors such as education levels, experience, occupation, or other relevant factors that could explain differences in earnings.", "Alternative data and analysis": "The expert refers to the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute, which conducts an annual analysis considering factors such as gender, race, education, experience, and geographic division. Their analysis puts the black-white wage gap at 14.5 percent for 2016, which differs from the claim made in the email.", "Variation within different demographic groups": "The expert highlights that the wage gap varies significantly between different demographic groups. For example, the wage gap between white men and black men is calculated to be 22 percent when adjusted for various factors, while the gap between white women and black women is 11.7 percent. This demonstrates that the wage gap is not uniform across all groups."}
