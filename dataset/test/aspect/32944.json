{"The credibility of the source": "One aspect that could have been employed to verify the authenticity of the claim is to evaluate the credibility of the source making the debunking statement. The expert's verdict does not provide any information about the source's credentials or reputation, which could have been used to assess their expertise and reliability.", "Review of scientific consensus": "Another aspect that could have been employed is to review the scientific consensus on climate change. The claim states that 97 percent of scientists believe humans are causing climate change, so verifying this consensus through peer-reviewed studies and surveys could help determine the authenticity of the claim. However, the expert's verdict does not provide any evidence or references to support or refute the consensus.", "Examination of data and methodology": "To verify the authenticity of the claim, it would be important to examine the data and methodology used to arrive at the 97 percent figure. This could involve reviewing the studies, surveys, or reports that have been conducted to determine the level of agreement among scientists. Unfortunately, the expert's verdict does not provide any specific information about the data or methodology used to arrive at the 97 percent figure.", "Evaluation of conflicting evidence": "Lastly, it would be crucial to evaluate any conflicting evidence or alternative viewpoints that challenge the claim. This could involve considering dissenting opinions, alternative explanations, or contradictory studies that question the consensus on climate change. However, the expert's verdict does not provide any analysis or discussion of conflicting evidence, making it difficult to assess the authenticity of the claim based on this aspect."}
