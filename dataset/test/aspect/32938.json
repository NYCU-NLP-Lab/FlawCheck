{"Video evidence": "The expert mentions that a video of Vice President Joe Biden speaking from the floor of the Senate in 2007 was played during the interview. In the video, Biden stated that the premise of President Bush's approach in Iraq was fundamentally flawed and that a strong central government would not be able to rally the Iraqi people. This video evidence supports the claim that Biden did advocate for a partition of Iraq.", "Verbal statement": "During the interview, Biden responded to the question about partition by stating, \"I never called for a partition.\" This verbal statement contradicts the claim and suggests that Biden did not advocate for a partition.", "Clarification of terminology": "Biden took issue with the word \"partition\" being used to describe his plan, stating that it was about allowing more autonomy to the regions within a central government. This clarification suggests that although Biden may not have used the term \"partition,\" his proposal did involve some form of dividing power and autonomy within Iraq.", "Use of terminology in media": "The expert mentions that in 2007, the word \"partition\" or \"soft partition\" was often used in headlines to describe Biden's proposal. This suggests that the media and public perception at the time understood Biden's plan as a form of partition, further supporting the claim."}
