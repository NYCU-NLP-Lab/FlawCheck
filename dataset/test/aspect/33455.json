{"The expert": "s verdict acknowledges that some types of CFL bulbs may result in greater exposure to certain forms of radiation compared to incandescent bulbs under specific conditions. This suggests that there are variations in the radiation emissions of different types of bulbs.", "The expert emphasizes that not all use of CFL bulbs should be avoided due to harmful levels of radiation": "This implies that there are safe usage scenarios for CFL bulbs and that the claim of CFL bulbs being universally dangerous is not accurate.", "The expert refers to a video posted on Facebook that purportedly shows a radiation detector picking up a": "soft attack\" from a CFL bulb. This indicates that there have been attempts to provide visual evidence supporting the claim, but the source of the video is unvetted and anonymous, raising doubts about its credibility.", "The expert cites the World Health Organization": "s conclusion that there is no definitive scientific evidence confirming the existence of health consequences from exposure to low-level electromagnetic fields, including those produced by CFL bulbs. This highlights the lack of scientific consensus on the claim and suggests that previous research does not support the notion that CFL bulbs emit unhealthy levels of radiation."}
