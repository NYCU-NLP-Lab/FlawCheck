{"The claim is based on a popular Facebook publication that circulates health advice on decreasing the risk of heart attacks": "The authenticity of this publication is questioned as it originated from an email chain and does not have a credible source.", "The claim falsely attributes the authority of Dr": "Virend Somers from the Mayo Clinic to support its claims. However, the study by Dr. Somers that is referenced in the publication does not mention water or aspirin as key factors in preventing heart attacks. Instead, it focuses on the correlation between sleep apnea and heart attacks.", "The Mayo Clinic issued a statement disassociating themselves from the email and stating that neither Dr": "Somers nor the clinic contributed to it. They also highlighted that the email contains inaccurate and potentially harmful information.", "Expert opinions from Dr": "Marc Gilinov, a cardiovascular surgeon at the Cleveland Clinic, and Dr. Andrew Pipes, former chief of the cardiac prevention and rehabilitation division of the University of Ottawa Heart Institute, both refute the claims made in the publication. They emphasize that there is no scientific evidence to support the idea that the timing of drinking water or taking aspirin has specific health benefits or affects the risk of heart attacks."}
