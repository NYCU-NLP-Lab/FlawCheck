{"Testimony from Jim Sullivan": "The expert's verdict mentions that Jim Sullivan, one of the candidates running for Milwaukee County executive, made the claim about police officers experiencing hours-long delays at the Mental Health Complex. This testimony serves as one aspect that was employed to verify the authenticity of the claim.", "Lack of direct evidence": "The expert's verdict also mentions that Jim Sullivan did not have any direct evidence to support his claim. This lack of direct evidence raises questions about the validity of the claim and is another aspect considered in verifying its authenticity.", "Investigation by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel": "The expert's verdict refers to the Patients in Peril investigation conducted by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. This investigation uncovered numerous problems at the Mental Health Complex, but it did not specifically mention delays faced by police officers transporting crisis patients. The absence of such information from the investigation is another aspect that was taken into account to assess the claim's authenticity.", "October 2010 study by a national consulting firm": "The expert's verdict mentions that a study conducted by a national consulting firm in October 2010 found that changes made by the county had been effective in reducing backups. This study contradicts Sullivan's claim about delays, providing another aspect that was considered to evaluate the claim's authenticity."}
