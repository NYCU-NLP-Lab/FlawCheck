{"The proposed constitutional amendment explicitly states that": "no member of the commission shall be subject to removal by the General Assembly or any member of the executive branch.\" This aspect verifies that a commission member cannot be removed from the commission, supporting the claim made by Secretary of State Jon Husted.", "The criteria for serving on the commission include a ban on state and federal elected officials": "their family members, lobbyists, and well-heeled donors. This aspect verifies that certain individuals with potential conflicts of interest are prohibited from serving on the commission, further supporting the claim.", "The commission would consist of 12 members": "including Democrats, Republicans, and independents or third-party members. This aspect ensures a diverse representation on the commission, reducing the likelihood of partisan bias and increasing transparency and fairness in the redistricting process.", "The proposed maps for redistricting must emphasize criteria such as compactness": "community preservation, competitiveness, and reflecting how Ohioans have voted. This aspect demonstrates that the commission's decisions would be based on objective factors rather than political motivations, strengthening the claim that political influence would be removed from the redistricting process."}
