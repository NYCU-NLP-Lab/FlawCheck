{"Explanation of right": "to-work states: The expert provided a clear explanation of what right-to-work states are, stating that employees in these states can decide whether or not they want to join or financially support a union. They also mentioned that there are 22 states with right-to-work laws, primarily located in the South, Plains region, and parts of the West.", "Data from the National Institute for Labor Relations Research": "The expert mentioned that Gingrich's claim is apparently rooted in data from the National Institute for Labor Relations Research. This data showed that between 1999 to 2009, job growth rose in right-to-work states by 3.7 percent and fell in \"forced-unionism states\" by 2.8 percent.", "Research from the National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation": "The expert also mentioned research conducted by the National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation, which looked at job growth from 2000 to 2010 in the 22 right-to-work states. This research found a less than 1 percent increase in private-sector job growth in these states, compared to a 5.5 percent decline in the other 28 states.", "Contradicting view from the Economic Policy Institute": "The expert mentioned that the Economic Policy Institute, an organization focused on raising the economic status of low- and middle-income Americans, argues that right-to-work laws have not succeeded in boosting employment growth in the states that have adopted them. They referenced a March report from the institute where two researchers attributed job growth in right-to-work states to other factors."}
