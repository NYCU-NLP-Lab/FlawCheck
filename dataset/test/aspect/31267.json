{"The guidelines for headstones at Arlington National Cemetery": "The expert referred to the guidelines provided on Arlington National Cemetery's website, which clearly state the permitted content for headstones. These guidelines do not include any provision for atypical epitaphs, such as the claim that Capt. Khan's headstone contained the phrase \"Beware of dying as an apostate.\"", "Capt": "Khan's actual headstone inscription: The expert examined Capt. Khan's headstone and found that it adhered to the guidelines mentioned above. The inscription on the headstone only included his rank, awards received, and the name of the campaign during which he lost his life. There was no mention of him being an \"apostate.\"", "Source of the claim": "The expert highlighted that the claim originated from Islamic State propaganda, as reported by Reuters. This suggests that the claim may have been fabricated or spread with malicious intent.", "Lack of evidence or credible sources": "The expert did not find any credible evidence or reliable sources supporting the claim that Capt. Khan's headstone contained the phrase \"Beware of dying as an apostate.\" This lack of evidence further undermines the authenticity of the claim."}
