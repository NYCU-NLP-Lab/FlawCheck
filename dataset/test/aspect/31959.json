{"Newspaper Clipping": "A newspaper clipping was shared as evidence to support the claim. The clipping reported the seizure of Rs 100 crore cash from the residence of Saumya Chaurasia, the deputy secretary in the Chhattisgarh chief minister's office.", "Image of Cash and Gold": "An image of stacks of cash and gold was also shared as evidence. The image was claimed to be from the confiscated amount during the raid.", "Multiple Sources": "The claim was promoted by different individuals on social media platforms, including BJP supporters and a former executive member of the BJP. This suggests that the claim gained traction and attention from multiple sources.", "Previous Reports": "It was found that the photograph of stacks of cash and jewellery was from a report in 2016 about the seizure of cash and gold from a hawala dealer in Karnataka. This raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim, as the image has been used in a different context in the past."}
