{"Comparison of claim to official reports": "The expert compared the claim made by Cicilline regarding the $100 billion spending in Afghanistan with official reports and research, such as the Congressional Research Service report and the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction report. These reports provided concrete figures and information about the actual spending in Afghanistan, allowing the expert to verify the authenticity of the claim.", "Analysis of campaign promises": "The expert examined whether President Obama had made a campaign promise to increase non-military aid to Afghanistan by another $1 billion to $3 billion.
