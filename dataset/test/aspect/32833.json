{"The claim that women": "make 77 cents for every dollar a man earns\" has been repeatedly used by President Barack Obama and other Democrats in various policy papers, blog posts, speeches, and proclamations. This shows that the claim has been consistently cited and promoted by influential figures.", "There are different versions of the claim": "with variations in wording that can significantly impact its accuracy. The less accurate version states that women make 77 cents for every dollar a man earns for the same work or in the same job, while the more accurate version simply states that women make 77 cents for every dollar a man earns, without specifying the nature of the work. This distinction is important in evaluating the claim's validity.", "The expert": "s verdict considered President Obama's statement that \"women deserve equal pay for equal work\" as aspirational rather than a part of the statistical claim. This suggests that the 77-cent pay differential may not necessarily refer to statistical comparisons of equal work. By separating the aspirational aspect from the statistical claim, the expert provides a clearer evaluation.", "To verify the authenticity of the claim": "the expert relies on federal data from two agencies: the U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. These agencies provide the basic data that underlies the claim, and their data is considered reliable and authoritative in evaluating the claim's accuracy."}
