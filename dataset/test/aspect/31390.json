{"Expert opinion": "Dr. John Sanders, chief of infectious diseases at Wake Forest Baptist Health, and Dr. Jacco Boon, an infectious disease professor at Washington University School of Medicine, both debunked the claim and stated that there is no cross-reactivity between influenza vaccines and COVID-19.", "Lack of scientific evidence": "The claim made by Dr. Rashid Buttar, the physician cited in the posts, is not supported by any scientific studies or research. In fact, the only studies he cites are outdated and unrelated to COVID-19.", "Reprimands and warnings": "Dr. Buttar has a history of being reprimanded by the North Carolina Medical Board and receiving a warning letter from the US Food and Drug Administration for promoting unapproved and potentially dangerous treatments. This raises concerns about his credibility and the accuracy of his claims.", "Improved testing technology": "The false positives mentioned in one of the studies cited by Dr. Buttar were due to vaccine contamination, not the interaction between influenza vaccines and COVID-19. Testing technology has significantly improved since then, making false positives less likely and further discrediting the claim."}
