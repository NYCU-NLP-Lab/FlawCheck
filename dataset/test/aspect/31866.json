{"The bill in question": "Senate Bill 377, was authored by GOP state senator Josh McKoon and was one of two bills that sparked the national debate over religious freedom and discrimination in Georgia.", "Critics argue that the bill": "along with House Bill 1023 by Rep. Sam Teasley, could potentially allow private business owners to refuse service to individuals they believe are gay, bisexual, or transgender based on religious grounds.", "Major corporations and opponents of the bill expressed concerns similar to those raised against a religious freedom bill in Arizona": "which was ultimately vetoed by the state's governor. Both bills in Georgia were seen as having slim chances of passing.", "McKoon argued that the bill aimed to support Catholic institutions that may be required to provide services": "such as abortion-inducing drugs, that go against their religious beliefs under the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). However, experts disputed McKoon's claims, stating that state law cannot exempt organizations from federal mandates."}
