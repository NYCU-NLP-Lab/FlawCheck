{"Comparison of statements": "The expert examined the claim made by Jeb Bush that Donald Trump said \"Two months ago, Donald Trump said that ISIS was not our fight\" and compared it to Trump's response of \"Never said that.\" This comparison helped verify the authenticity of the claim by analyzing the conflicting statements.", "Analysis of interview transcripts": "The expert delved into the archives and found two quotes from different interviews that shed light on what Trump really said about ISIS. By analyzing these transcripts, the expert was able to determine the accuracy of the claim made by Jeb Bush.", "Corroboration with campaign spokesperson": "The expert reached out to the Bush campaign and confirmed with spokesman Matt Gorman that the interview with CNN's Erin Burnett was indeed the source referenced by Bush during the debate. This corroboration added credibility to the claim and the subsequent verification process.", "Examination of additional comments": "The expert also discovered another set of comments made by Trump in a July 8, 2015, interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper.
