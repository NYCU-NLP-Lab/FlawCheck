{"The claim originated from tweets made by Morgan Brittany and Charlie Kirk": "which were the earliest sources found mentioning the \"life insurance\" folder. These tweets were not backed by any credible evidence or sources.", "The claim gained traction when it was widely circulated in numerous articles": "all citing the same uncorroborated tweets as their source. No additional evidence or verification was provided to support the claim.", "Prior to the tweets": "a commenter on the website Zero Hedge made a similar remark about the \"life insurance\" folder, but it appeared to be a joking reference to the long-circulating \"body count\" rumor associated with the Clintons. This suggests that the claim may have been intended as a sarcastic or humorous remark rather than a factual statement.", "Another aspect of the claim was that Huma Abedin had cut a deal or was negotiating with the FBI": "Several tweets and blog posts mentioned this, but again, no credible evidence or sources were provided to support this assertion."}
