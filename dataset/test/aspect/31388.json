{"The first aspect employed to verify the authenticity of the claim was a reverse image search on one of the pictures": "which revealed that it was actually taken in Pakistan in December 2011, not in Australia during spider season.", "Another aspect used to verify the claim was the identification of a picture of a giant web at Lake Tawakoni in Texas": "which was mistakenly included in the post. The superintendent of Lake Tawakoni State Park confirmed that the picture was taken in Texas, not in Australia.", "The third aspect involved the identification of a picture taken in Yinnar": "Victoria, Australia, which showed a park covered in spiderwebs. This picture was confirmed to be authentic and was the only image out of the four that was actually from Australia.", "Lastly": "the expert's verdict mentioned that during periods of high rainfall or flooding, spiders in Australia can travel across entire oceans using a method called ballooning. The phenomenon has been witnessed in Australia before, which adds credibility to the claim of spider season in the country."}
