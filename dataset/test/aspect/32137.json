{"The claim of a Disney cartoon showing Mickey Mouse using an unusual method to make Swiss cheese was not based on a real Disney film": "2. The animated GIF featuring Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, and Peg Leg Pete in a cheese factory was created on an Internet forum in 2011 and not part of an official Disney production.", "The characters in the GIF were taken from the 1928 Disney cartoon short Steamboat Willie": "which does not contain a scene set in a cheese factory.", "Various elements in the GIF": "such as Mickey Mouse's hip movements, Minnie Mouse's cranking motion, the laughing parrot, and Peg Leg Pete's pose, were added to the original frames of Steamboat Willie, indicating that it was manipulated and not an authentic Disney creation."}
