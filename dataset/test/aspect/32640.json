{"The expert searched Frinkiac": "a website that allows fans to search \"The Simpsons\" archives for quotes and jokes, and found no mentions of the words \"Greenland,\" \"Trump,\" and \"Denmark\" together. This suggests that there is no episode of the show that predicted Trump canceling his trip to Denmark over the Greenland issue.", "The expert mentioned that": "The Simpsons\" has a reputation for \"predicting\" future events, but many of these predictions turn out to be hoaxes. They provided examples of events that the show did not predict, such as Trump's presidential bid announcement, Lady Gaga's Superbowl halftime show, and the fire at Notre Dame cathedral. This casts doubt on the authenticity of the claim.", "Social media posts by Senator Chris Murphy and MSNBC host Rachel Maddow jokingly referenced the supposed": "prediction\" in \"The Simpsons.\" However, these posts were likely made in jest and not meant to be taken seriously as evidence of the show's predictive abilities.", "The expert noted that they have previously covered": "The Simpsons\" predictions about Trump's presidency and found that the first mention of a \"President Trump\" came in a 2000 episode. This suggests that the show did not specifically predict Trump's actions regarding Greenland and Denmark."}
