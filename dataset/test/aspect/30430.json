{"Snopes fact": "checking: Snopes, a reputable fact-checking website, conducted an investigation and rated the claim as Mostly False after interviewing businesses near the Red Hen restaurant. They found that while Sanders' inlaws went to another nearby restaurant, the Southern Inn, it was not clear whether the Red Hen owner followed them or simply happened to be passing by.", "Lack of police reports": "PolitiFact contacted the Lexington, Va. police to inquire about any reports of a threat against Sanders but did not receive a reply. The absence of any official reports suggests that there is no evidence to support the claim of a sick threat.", "Lack of evidence in news sources": "The Houston Post, a pro-Trump website, published a headline claiming that the Red Hen owner issued a sick threat to Sarah Sanders. However, the article itself did not provide any information or evidence to support this claim. This highlights the lack of substantiation in news sources.", "Red Hen owner": "s statement: Stephanie Wilkinson, the owner of the Red Hen, asked Sanders to leave the restaurant after staff members expressed concerns. Wilkinson later told the Washington Post that she considered the Trump administration to be \"inhumane and unethical.\" While this statement reflects her personal opinion, it does not indicate any direct threat towards Sanders."}
