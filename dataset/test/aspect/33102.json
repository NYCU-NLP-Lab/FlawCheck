Instead, it allows for an external transabdominal procedure.", "The expert determined that the budget requires healthcare providers to determine whether there is a detectable fetal heartbeat before performing an abortion": "and the method for detecting the heartbeat is specified to be performed externally.", "The expert noted that Maddow": "s claim of a \"mandatory vaginal probe\" was not accurate and that external methods such as transabdominal ultrasounds are both allowed and required under the new law."}
