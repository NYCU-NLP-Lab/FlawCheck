{"The claim in question was not supported by any specific evidence or source": "The expert noted that several emails were received asking for fact-checking, but no links, images, or other information about the origin of the quote were provided.", "The expert searched for any verifiable statement made by Attorney General Jeff Sessions that aligns with the claim": "They found multiple quotes from Sessions discussing immigration policies and border enforcement, but none that directly matched the wording of the claim.", "News articles and interviews were examined to gather information about Sessions": "statements on border policy. While Sessions did address the issue of separating families at the border, his statements focused on prosecuting individuals who crossed the border unlawfully or smuggled children, rather than explicitly making the claim mentioned.", "The expert also highlighted a specific interview conducted by radio host Hugh Hewitt": "where Sessions was asked about the necessity of separating parents from children at the border. Sessions responded by emphasizing the consequences of illegally bringing children across the border, but again, did not make the exact claim mentioned in the initial statement."}
