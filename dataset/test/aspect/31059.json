{"The concept of": "diamond batteries\" is a theoretical application of the technology already employed in non diamond-based technologies that generate energy from radioactive material.", "The idea of creating synthetic": "diamond batteries\" using radioactive carbon-14 sourced from nuclear waste is still in the theoretical stage and faces numerous challenges not discussed in viral stories.", "Professor Tom Scott from the University of Bristol gave a lecture discussing the potential of using radioactive diamonds made from carbon extracted from radioactive graphite casing found in nuclear waste as a long": "lasting source of energy.", "The lecture highlighted the accumulation of radioactive graphite in the UK": "s nuclear reactors and proposed the use of radioactive carbon-14 to create highly and deliberately radioactive diamonds for energy generation."}
