{"The expert found that there is no evidence that Rep": "Devin Nunes ever said \"defending Trump is more important than the United States.\" This statement was not supported by any credible sources or recordings.", "The leaked audio that was cited in the claim was actually recorded in July 2018": "not 2019 as the Facebook post claimed. The audio was obtained and aired by MSNBC during the Rachel Maddow Show on August 8, 2018.", "Nunes": "comments in the leaked audio focused on the investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller into Russian election interference in 2016 and the role of the Trump campaign. He expressed concerns about the potential consequences if then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions did not unrecuse himself and Mueller did not clear the president.", "The purpose of Nunes": "comments in the leaked audio was to defend Trump from the Mueller investigation in order to maintain the Republican majority in Congress ahead of the midterm elections. This indicates that Nunes' motivation was to protect his party's political power, rather than prioritizing the interests of the United States."}
