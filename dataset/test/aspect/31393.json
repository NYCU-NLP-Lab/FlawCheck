{"The phrase": "Life is hard; it's even harder when you're stupid\" is commonly attributed to John Wayne, but the expert's verdict confirms that John Wayne did not actually say this line in any of his films or in real life.", "The claim that John Wayne said this line in the movie Sands of Iwo Jima is debunked": "as no character in the film, including Sgt. Stryker, speaks such a line. There is no evidence in the form of film clips or scripts supporting this claim in any of John Wayne's movies.", "The earliest known cinematic use of a similar thought appears in the 1973 film The Friends of Eddie Coyle": "based on a 1970 novel by George V. Higgins. The character Jackie Brown, played by Steven Keats, says, \"This life's hard, but it's harder if you're stupid.\" This line, with slight variations, was used in the film's promotion.", "There is also a claim that John Wayne said this line during a 1966 guest appearance on The Dean Martin Show": "but there is no conclusive evidence or footage to support this claim."}
