{"Comparison with historical data": "The expert compared President Obama's approval ratings at the end of his first year with those of previous post-World War II presidents. This comparison was made using Gallup's historical data, which dates back to Harry Truman.", "Clarification of rhetorical excess": "The expert clarified that Karl Rove's claim of Obama having the worst ratings of \"any president\" at the end of his first year was a rhetorical excess. Instead, the comparison should have been made among post-World War II presidents.", "Measurement at the end of the first year": "The expert acknowledged that Rove misspoke when referring to measuring Obama's ratings at the end of his first year. However, to assess Rove's statement, the expert asked Gallup to provide approval ratings for December of the first year in office for postwar presidents, allowing for a more direct comparison with Obama's ratings.", "Consideration of unique circumstances": "The expert considered that not all postwar presidents assumed office under the same circumstances. Some were elected, while others came to office after the death or resignation of their predecessor. This distinction was taken into account when comparing their approval ratings, as it may have influenced their initial ratings at the end of their first year."}
