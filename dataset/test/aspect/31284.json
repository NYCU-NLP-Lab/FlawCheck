{"The expert mentions that there have been various studies about average premium increases since the implementation of the health care law": "but the results vary widely depending on the methodology and available information. This indicates that there is no consensus on the exact percentage increase in health insurance costs for Floridians.", "The expert highlights that some predictions made by Florida officials were based on a hypothetical plan that was not even available for sale in the state": "This suggests that certain claims about the 30 percent or more increase in health insurance costs may not be based on actual data.", "The expert mentions a national survey by the investment firm Morgan Stanley": "which showed that Florida was experiencing a 36.8 percent increase for individual plans and a 20.7 percent increase for small group plans based on the response of six insurance brokers. This survey provides some evidence supporting the claim of increased health insurance costs in Florida.", "The expert quotes Greg Mellowe": "director of health research and analysis at the Florida Center for Fiscal and Economic Policy, who states that a 30 percent increase in health care policy would be an extreme outlier and representing those consumers as typical Floridians would be grossly misleading. This suggests that the claim of a 30 percent or more increase in health insurance costs may not be representative of the majority of Floridians' experiences."}
