{"Multiple sources and videos": "The expert's verdict mentions that there were multiple videos and sources that were examined to verify the claim. These videos included footage of victims of a gas leak in India, a bee attack in Nicaragua, swarming bees in New York City, and a hornet attacking a rat. The mention of these different videos helps to establish that the claim is not based on a single source or incident.", "Comparison with previous claims": "The expert's verdict highlights that a similar claim about killer bees in India was shared on Facebook before, along with similar footage shared in Indonesian. This comparison with previous claims helps to establish a pattern and raises doubts about the authenticity of the current claim.", "Verification through official statements": "The expert's verdict mentions that the Central Z-1 Fire Department in Managua confirmed that the incident shown in the videos was caused by Africanised bees and happened outside Metrocentro shopping mall. This official statement adds credibility to the verification process and helps to confirm the authenticity of the claim.", "Reverse image search": "The expert's verdict mentions the use of reverse image search on Google to find the original sources of the videos. This technique helps to trace the origin of the footage and cross-verify it with reliable news sources. In this case, the reverse image search led to the discovery of news clips published by Indian news channel Prag News and the Facebook page of France TV New Delhi, which further supports the verification process."}
