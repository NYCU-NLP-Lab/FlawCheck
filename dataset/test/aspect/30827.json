{"The image used to claim the discovery of a temple upon the demolition of a mosque in Karnataka was found to be a digital creation by an artist named Chandra Colourist": "This was verified by finding the artist's Facebook account where the same image was posted and the artist confirmed it was his digital creation.", "A reverse image search on Google revealed that the original photograph used by the artist to create the digital image was taken by a photographer named Meiqianbao in China": "The original picture was of Longmen Grottoes - Fengxiang temple stone Buddhas in Luoyang, Henan, China.", "Various individuals and organizations": "including a Twitter handle, fake news website Postcard News, and a website named Struggle for Hindu Existence, had previously shared the same image with the false claim. This indicates a pattern of misinformation surrounding the image.", "The former District Magistrate of Raichur": "who was contacted by Alt News, confirmed that the information being shared on social media about the discovery of a temple during the demolition in Raichur is untrue.
