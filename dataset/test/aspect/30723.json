{"The presence of a video clip": "The expert's verdict mentions that BJP Delhi spokesperson Tajinder Bagga tweeted an 18-second clip of the protest at the Gateway of India. This video clip serves as evidence to verify the claim.", "Analysis of the video clip": "Alt News, a fact-checking organization, analyzed the video clip and found that Bagga's claim about the protesters chanting \"Hinduo se azadi\" was false. They discovered a Facebook Live of the protest where the 18-second portion tweeted by Bagga can be heard from 17:53 minutes onward. This analysis provides further evidence to refute the claim.", "Translation of the slogans": "The expert's verdict includes a translation of the slogans chanted by Umar Khalid during the protest. The translation shows that the slogans were against casteism, Manuvaad, RSS, PM Modi, Home Minister Amit Shah, and RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat, rather than against Hindus. This translation helps clarify the context and intent of the slogans.", "Corroboration with additional video evidence": "The expert's verdict mentions that the same slogans can be heard in a live-streamed video on YouTube from 52:42 minutes onward. This additional video evidence supports the conclusion that the claim about protesters raising \"Hinduo se azadi\" slogans is false."}
