{"Lack of credible news outlet reporting a winner in Pennsylvania": "The expert's verdict mentions that at the time the messages were posted declaring Trump as the winner, no credible news outlets had reported a winner in Pennsylvania. This indicates that there was no official confirmation of the claim.", "Warning label added by Twitter": "Shortly after the messages were posted, Twitter added a warning label to inform viewers that \"official sources may not have called the race when this was Tweeted.\" This suggests that the claim was not supported by official sources or verified information.", "Ongoing ballot counting": "The expert's verdict states that approximately 30 minutes after the messages were posted, ballots were still being counted in Pennsylvania. This indicates that the final result of the election in Pennsylvania was not yet determined, casting doubt on the claim of Trump's victory.", "Mail": "in ballots favoring Biden: The New York Times reports that the majority of remaining ballots to be counted in Pennsylvania were mail-in ballots, which have so far favored Biden. This implies that the final result could potentially change in favor of Biden, further questioning the authenticity of the claim."}
