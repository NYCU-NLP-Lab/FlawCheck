{"The claim is made by Martina Navratilova": "a well-known retired tennis player who has been openly gay for over three decades. This adds credibility to her statement as she has personal experience and knowledge of the discrimination faced by the LGBTQ+ community.", "The claim is supported by the Human Rights Campaign": "a reputable gay-rights group, which states that 29 states in the country do not have laws explicitly prohibiting employment discrimination based on sexual orientation. This provides external validation for Navratilova's claim.", "The expert": "s verdict mentions that the absence of a law prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation in these 29 states means that employees who believe they are discriminated against would not have legal grounds to win a lawsuit. This legal perspective reinforces the authenticity of the claim.", "The expert also highlights an exception to the rule": "stating that government employees in these states have protections under the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. This exception further establishes the accuracy of the claim by acknowledging that discrimination based on sexual orientation is not universally allowed even in these 29 states."}
