{"Data from the state Division of Criminal Justice Services": "The expert's verdict mentions that Senator Kirsten Gillibrand relied on data from a February article published by Politico New York, which cited data from the state Division of Criminal Justice Services. This data was provided by the agency and confirms Gillibrand's claim regarding the arrest rates of black and Latino people compared to white people for marijuana possession in New York City.", "Arrest statistics in New York City": "The expert's verdict highlights that the data from the state Division of Criminal Justice Services reveals that 86% of people arrested for criminal possession of marijuana in New York City last year were either black or Hispanic. In contrast, only 9% of those arrested were white. These statistics provide evidence to support Gillibrand's claim of a significant disparity in arrest rates based on race.", "Limitations of the data": "The expert's verdict also mentions certain caveats associated with the data. It states that the data does not include every marijuana arrest in the city and only tracks arrests for burning marijuana in public or possessing more than 25 grams at a time. More severe crimes like selling marijuana are not included in the numbers. This information acknowledges the limitations of the data used to verify the claim.", "Disparity in arrest rates outside New York City": "The expert's verdict states that the gap in arrest rates between black, Latino, and white individuals for marijuana possession is not as wide outside New York City, according to state data. It mentions that in upstate and Long Island, about 31% of the arrests were white, 37% were black, and 25% were Hispanic. This aspect provides additional context and suggests that the racial disparity in arrest rates may vary across different regions of New York state."}
