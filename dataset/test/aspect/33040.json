{"The image of Magic Johnson donating blood was traced back to its original source": "a documentary titled Endgame: AIDS in Black America, which provided evidence that the image was not related to a blood donation for leukemia patients.", "A fake news site rediscovered the image and falsely attributed it to a blood drive organized by Magic Johnson to support the National Awareness Month for Leukemia and Lymphoma": "This false attribution added to the confusion surrounding the claim.", "The fact that Magic Johnson has been diagnosed as HIV": "positive since November 1991 raised concerns and skepticism about his ability to donate blood. It was reported that his HIV cell count remains low, but the virus still lives within him.", "The image itself": "when posted on social media by comedian D.L. Hughley, was mistakenly associated with Magic Johnson organizing a blood drive and participating in blood transfusions. However, it was clarified that the image actually showed Johnson undergoing medical tests/treatment associated with his HIV-positive status and not donating blood."}
