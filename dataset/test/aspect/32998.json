{"Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida announced in November 2020 that it would be deploying semi": "autonomous four-legged unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) known as \"robot dogs\" as a new security feature.", "The claim was verified to be true during a Nov": "10 event held at Tyndall AFB, making it the first military base in the U.S. to implement semi-autonomous UGVs in a defense regime.", "Tyndall AFB partnered with Ghost Robotics": "a technological robotic company, to manufacture these legged robotics designed for military and homeland security purposes. The robots have all-terrain stability and reduced mechanical complexity, which increases their durability and agility while reducing costs.", "The robot dogs will serve as a force multiplier for enhanced situational awareness by patrolling areas that are not suitable for human beings and vehicles": "They can be controlled via a virtual-reality headset and have mobile cameras and sensor platforms to detect and relay information. These UGVs will not replace military working dogs but will assist in relieving patrolling duties and allowing military personnel to focus on other security needs."}
