General Mike Jackson, not James Blunt, actually refused to fire on the soldiers, stating that he would not have his soldiers be responsible for starting World War III.", "The claim that James Blunt prevented World War III can be traced back to a misleading title of an article about an interview he gave to BBC Radio 5 in 2010": "4. James Blunt stated in the interview that he was given a direct order from General Wesley Clark to \"overpower\" the Russian soldiers but he would have refused the order if necessary."}
