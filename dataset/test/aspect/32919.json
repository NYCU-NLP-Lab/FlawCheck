{"The expert": "s verdict states that President Donald Trump's claim that Rep. Ilhan Omar talked about \"how great al Qaeda is\" and said, \"When I think of al Qaeda, I can hold my chest out\" is false. This indicates that there is no evidence to support Trump's accusation against Omar.", "The expert also mentions that Trump misleadingly claimed that polls showed Omar only has 8": "support, without mentioning that this figure is from a poll of white likely general-election voters without a bachelor's degree. This highlights a misleading tactic used by Trump to undermine Omar's popularity.", "The expert clarifies that there is no evidence to support Trump": "s claim that Omar has made statements supporting al Qaeda. This suggests that Trump's accusation is baseless and lacks factual support.", "The expert mentions that Trump": "s reference to Omar as \"pro Al-Qaeda\" in a tweet is also unsupported by any evidence. This further undermines the credibility of Trump's claim against Omar."}
