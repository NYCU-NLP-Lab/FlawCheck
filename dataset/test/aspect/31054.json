{"Different methods of measuring dropout rates": "The expert points out that there are various ways to measure how many students leave school before graduating, and each method can yield different statistical results. This variation in measurement methods adds to the complexity of determining the accuracy of the claim.", "Terminology confusion": "The expert highlights that the term \"dropout rate\" can be used differently in public discourse, depending on who is using it. This ambiguity in terminology further complicates the verification process.", "Distinction between dropouts and non": "graduates: The expert mentions that not all students who do not graduate are considered dropouts. There are different data and measurements involved in calculating graduation rates. Therefore, it is important to focus specifically on counting dropouts when evaluating the claim.", "The use of attrition rate as evidence": "The expert mentions that the \"one in three\" statistic cited by the politicians is based on the attrition rate, which tracks the decline in enrollment between one year and a later one. The nonprofit Intercultural Development Research Association (IDRA) in San Antonio has calculated attrition rates of 31 percent and 33 percent for specific graduating classes. However, there is a debate over whether attrition rates provide a comprehensive measure of a school's ability to keep students enrolled until graduation."}
