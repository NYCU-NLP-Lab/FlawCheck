{"The first aspect employed to verify the authenticity of the claim is the comparison of fundraising totals": "The expert mentions that Murphy claimed to have raised more money than any other challenger in the nation for two consecutive quarters, with a fundraising total of over $800,000. To verify this, the expert checks the Federal Election Commission's records and confirms that Murphy raised $808,671.59 through June 30, 2011.", "Another aspect used to verify the claim is the analysis of campaign finance reports": "The expert contacts the Federal Election Commission and requests information on the top fundraisers among congressional challengers. The FEC provides a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet containing the data, which allows the expert to compare Murphy's fundraising total with other challengers.", "The expert also considers the credibility of the source": "Murphy made the claim on his own campaign website, which suggests that he has a vested interest in presenting positive information about his campaign. However, the expert takes this into account and seeks independent verification of the claim through the FEC and their campaign finance reports.", "Additionally": "the expert takes into consideration the context and background information related to the claim. The expert mentions that Allen West, the incumbent Republican representative, had raised over $6.5 million in 2010 for his successful campaign. This information provides a benchmark for evaluating the significance of Murphy's claim and the fundraising competition he faces."}
