{"Lack of evidence": "The expert's verdict mentions that as of the time of the statement, there was no evidence to support the claim of multiple gunmen dressed as security guards during the Las Vegas shooting. This suggests that one aspect employed to verify the claim was the absence of any substantial evidence or proof.", "Contradictory eyewitness accounts": "The expert's verdict highlights the contradictory statements made by Brian Hodge, an alleged eyewitness. While Hodge initially claimed to have seen multiple gunmen, he later provided a different account to the Sydney Morning Herald, stating that he never made it to his room on the 32nd floor and did not know the location of the shooter. This contradiction in the eyewitness accounts could have been another aspect used to assess the claim's authenticity.", "Unreliable sources": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim originated from an online website called Neon Nettle, which describes itself as \"free independent news.\" However, the expert dismisses this source as pushing a false story. The use of unreliable sources, such as this website, could have been another aspect employed to evaluate the claim's credibility.", "Lack of corroboration": "The expert's verdict states that while there are some reports of a security guard being shot, there is no confirmation of its accuracy. Additionally, the expert points out that there is no evidence to support Hodge's claim of multiple shooters. The absence of corroboration from other witnesses or official sources could have been another aspect considered to verify the authenticity of the claim."}
