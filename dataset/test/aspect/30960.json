{"Reports from major media and NGO organizations": "The expert mentions that in April 2017, the United Nations' International Organization for Migration uncovered slave markets in Libya and Niger. This report provided evidence of the slave trade in Libya. Additionally, the expert mentions the undercover footage obtained and broadcast by CNN in November 2017, which further confirmed the existence of slave auctions in Libya.", "Facebook post with accompanying photographs": "The claim is based on a November 2017 Facebook post by Rayon Pyne, which included several photographs purportedly illustrating the slave trade in Libya. The post gained significant attention and was shared over 428,000 times, prompting inquiries about the authenticity of the photographs.", "Investigation into the source of the images": "The expert's assessment involved researching the origin of each photograph to determine their authenticity. They were able to trace the source of one image to two posts on an Italian blog, which discussed abuse and torture in Libyan detention centers. However, they couldn't verify the attribution of the image to the Italian photographer mentioned.", "Comparison with unrelated images": "To verify the authenticity of the claim, the expert identified an image included in the Facebook post that was unrelated to the slave trade in Libya. They determined that the photograph was taken in the Ivory Coast in 2011 during unrest and violence following a presidential election. This comparison helped establish the lack of credibility for at least one of the images."}
