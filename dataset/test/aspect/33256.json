{"The claim is based on a joint study conducted by Citizens for Tax Justice and US PIRG": "two left-leaning organizations. These organizations analyzed the accumulated profits offshore for tax purposes held by Fortune 500 companies, which amounted to over $2.1 trillion.", "The study focused on the 57 corporations that disclosed the size of their tax bill if they were to repatriate the money": "These 57 companies were found to owe an additional $184.4 billion in federal taxes.", "Assumptions were made by the analysts to estimate the tax obligations of the companies that did not disclose this information": "Based on these assumptions, it was calculated that all Fortune 500 companies combined would owe a total of $620 billion in additional federal taxes.", "Independent tax scholars": "including Richard Harvey from Villanova School of Law, supported the estimate provided by the study, suggesting that the claim made by Bernie Sanders might even be an underestimation."}
