{"The author of the British Medical Journal piece on flu vaccine dangers is not a Johns Hopkins scientist": "but rather an anthropologist who completed a fellowship in comparative effectiveness research at Johns Hopkins. This discredits the claim that a Johns Hopkins scientist issued the report.", "The British Medical Journal piece was not a peer": "reviewed study or research article. It was categorized as a \"News & Views\" feature, which can be easily confused as peer-reviewed research findings by readers unfamiliar with the journal.", "The natural news blog article that reported on the": "blistering report\" was published over a year earlier by a different alternative health news site. This suggests that the claim may have been exaggerated or misrepresented in the subsequent articles.", "The importance of the referenced BMJ feature by Peter Doshi was greatly exaggerated by the natural news sites": "While Doshi argued that the potential risks of aggressive flu vaccination have not been highlighted sufficiently, the claim that the flu shot benefits are overestimated was not supported by his feature."}
