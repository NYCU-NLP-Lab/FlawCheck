{"The expert clarifies that Gov": "Scott Walker's proposal to cut income and property taxes would increase the state's \"structural deficit,\" which is different from an actual budget deficit. This means that while there may be a higher structural deficit, it does not necessarily translate into an immediate budget deficit.", "The expert highlights that Gov": "Scott Walker has previously claimed to have solved the state government's budget problems. However, his opponents argue that his proposed tax cuts contradict his fiscal conservative stance.", "A group criticized Gov": "Scott Walker's plan to cut income and property taxes, stating that it would increase the state deficit at a time when borrowing is already at record levels. This statement questions the responsibility of such a decision.", "The expert explains that the structural deficit is not a measure of the current state budget": "s deficit but rather an estimate of how tax and spending commitments will align in the next budget period. In this case, the structural deficit projection for 2015-\u201917 increased due to Walker's proposed tax cuts, reducing revenue and potentially creating a deficit in the future."}
