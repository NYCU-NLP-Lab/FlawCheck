{"Testimony from Coalition To Save Memorial Hospital Birthing Center": "The expert's verdict mentions that the Health Department heard hours of testimony from mothers and nurses rallying around Memorial Hospital, specifically in support of the birthing center. This testimony can be considered as evidence to verify the claim.", "Quote from Coalition leader Alana Bibeau": "Alana Bibeau, a sociology professor at the University of Rhode Island and leader of the Coalition To Save Memorial Hospital Birthing Center, praised the Memorial unit for its dedication to care for mothers. She specifically stated that the unit strives to implement the principles of Mother-Friendly care as outlined by the national Coalition for Improving Maternity Services Mother-Friendly Childbirth Initiative. This quote from a credible source supports the claim.", "Information from the Coalition for Improving Maternity Services": "website: The expert's verdict mentions that Bibeau pointed to the Coalition for Improving Maternity Services' website, where they found a list of 10 steps that hospitals, birth centers, or home birth services can take to be more \"mother-friendly.\" Although the website does not have a formal certification process for hospitals, it provides guidelines and steps that facilities are encouraged to follow. This information can be used to verify the claim.", "Statement from the Rhode Island Department of Health": "The expert's verdict mentions that the Rhode Island Department of Health does not certify hospitals as \"Mother-Friendly\" and does not endorse these principles for their birthing units. However, the statement also acknowledges that there is merit to some of the commitments outlined by the Coalition for Improving Maternity Services. This statement provides additional context and perspective on the claim."}
