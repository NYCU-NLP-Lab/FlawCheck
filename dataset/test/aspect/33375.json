{"The expert": "s verdict is based on once-secret U.S. government documents made public by Wikileaks. These documents provide individualized assessments by the Defense Department's Guantanamo leadership, which give background and risk assessments of each of the five detainees being released.", "One aspect used to verify the authenticity of the claim is the assessment of Mullah Mohammad Fazl": "According to experts, Fazl is considered one of the most dangerous to United States interests among the five detainees. He was an experienced commander against the U.S.-backed Northern Alliance, served as the Taliban's army chief of staff, and is wanted by the UN for possible war crimes, including the murder of thousands of Shiites. The leaked documents also mention Fazl's operational associations with significant al Qaeda and other extremist personnel, as well as his influence as a recruiting symbol for the Taliban.", "Another aspect is the assessment of Mullah Norullah Noori": "Noori is described as a senior Taliban military commander and the onetime governor of Balkh province. Similar to Fazl, he is on the United Nations' radar screen for possible war crimes.", "The fact that the five detainees are being held in Qatar for a year without the right to travel elsewhere is also mentioned as an aspect that verifies the authenticity of the claim": "This information was provided by Sen. John McCain during his questioning of whether it was in the United States' best interests to release the detainees."}
