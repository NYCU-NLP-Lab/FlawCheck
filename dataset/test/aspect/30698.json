{"Epidemiological trends": "The expert notes that one of the fallacies surrounding vaccines is the belief that they are responsible for the increased incidence of childhood peanut allergies. The expert dismisses this claim by highlighting that there is no evidence to support this link.", "Lack of evidence": "The expert points out that articles and individuals making the connection between vaccines and peanut allergies rely on the false premise that vaccines contain undisclosed traces of peanut oil. The expert states that there is no substantiated evidence to support this claim.", "Origins of the claim": "The expert highlights that the claim may have originated from the book \"The Peanut Allergy Epidemic\" by Heather Fraser, which suggests that some adjuvants in injections may have sensitized children to peanut allergies. However, the expert notes that this specific chapter and the evidence it cites are the basis for many peanut oil claims on anti-vaccine websites.", "Historical use of peanut oil": "The expert mentions that peanut oil was indeed used as an adjuvant in vaccines in the mid-60s and became a common trade secret ingredient in vaccine adjuvants. However, this does not imply that peanut oil is currently present in childhood vaccines or flu shots, as claimed. The expert explains that the use of peanut oil as an adjuvant has evolved over time and does not support the notion of its secret presence in vaccines."}
