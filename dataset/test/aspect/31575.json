{"Timing of the posts": "The expert's verdict highlights that the timing of the posts conveying the impression that Fox 2 Detroit had reported on voter fraud during the 2020 election was misleading. The graphic and report were from December 2019, not November 2020.", "Lawsuit dropped": "The expert's verdict mentions that the lawsuit referenced in the report was dropped by the plaintiff on July 1, 2020, after the city of Detroit took remedial action.

This aspect highlights the importance of verifying the authenticity and context of the information being shared.", "Lack of evidence of widespread voter fraud": "The expert's verdict states that no actual evidence of widespread voter fraud was presented during the 2020 election.
