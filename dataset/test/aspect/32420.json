{"Selective quoting of petrol prices in BJP": "governed states: The expert's verdict highlights that the infographic shared by BJP Tamil Nadu's spokesperson selectively quoted only those BJP-governed states where petrol prices were below Rs 90 per litre. This omission of states where petrol prices were higher than Rs 90 per litre indicates a biased presentation of data to support the claim.", "Omission of BJP": "governed states with petrol prices over Rs 90: The expert's analysis reveals that two major BJP-governed states, Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh, were not included in the infographic despite having petrol prices over Rs 90 per litre. This omission raises questions about the accuracy and completeness of the information presented.", "Incorrect categorization of non": "BJP-governed states: The expert's verdict points out that the infographic listed Bihar, Meghalaya, and Nagaland as non-BJP-governed states, even though the BJP is in alliance with regional parties in these states. This factual inaccuracy undermines the credibility of the comparison made in the infographic.", "Exclusion of petrol prices in other non": "BJP-governed states: The expert's analysis highlights that the infographic did not include petrol prices in INC-governed Punjab, YSRCP-governed Andhra Pradesh, and BJD-governed Odisha, all of which had petrol prices over Rs 90 per litre. This exclusion indicates a lack of comprehensive data representation and a potential bias in favor of the claim."}
