{"Lack of credible sources": "The expert's verdict highlights that the article in question was published on a website called Reaganwasright, which is known for publishing satire and fan fiction. This lack of credibility in the source raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Inconsistencies in the story": "The article claims that Rosa Parks' granddaughter, Muriel Parks-Gouldman, made statements defending President Trump. However, it is pointed out that Rosa Parks did not have any children, let alone a granddaughter. This inconsistency further questions the veracity of the claim.", "Use of misleading images": "The expert's verdict mentions that the photo accompanying the article is not of Rosa Parks' granddaughter but of Ohio state lawmaker Nina Turner. This deliberate use of misleading images adds to the suspicion surrounding the claim.", "Satirical disclaimer": "Upon contacting the website on Facebook, the expert received a reply directing them to scroll to the bottom of the page, where a disclaimer stated that nothing on the site is real and that it is satire. This clear indication that the article is not meant to be taken seriously undermines the credibility of the claim."}
