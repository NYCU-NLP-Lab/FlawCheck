{"The issuance of an executive order": "The expert's verdict highlights that Governor Rick Perry issued an executive order in 2007, requiring all Texas girls to receive a vaccine against HPV before entering the sixth grade. This aspect verifies the claim that there was an order in place.", "Opposition and blocking of the order": "Lawmakers and critics opposed the executive order, arguing that the vaccine was too new and that it infringed on parental rights. This aspect supports the claim that there was resistance to the order and adds to its authenticity.", "Optional vaccination requirement": "Governor Perry defended his action by stating that the legislation was not mandatory. The expert's verdict confirms that the order included an opt-out provision, allowing parents to request a conscientious objection affidavit form. This aspect verifies that the order had an optional aspect to it.", "Conscientious objection forms and exemption affidavits": "The Department of State Health Services provided a process for parents to dissent from the vaccination requirement by filing conscientious objection forms. These forms needed to be renewed every two years to maintain their validity. This aspect confirms the existence of a process for exemption, further supporting the claim's authenticity."}
