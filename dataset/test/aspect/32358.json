{"Delta Air Lines": "promise to maintain the flight from Memphis to Amsterdam: The expert's verdict provides evidence of U.S. Rep. Steve Cohen questioning Delta CEO Richard H. Anderson about the continuation of the Amsterdam flight, to which Anderson responded affirmatively. However, Delta later announced that the flight would be converted to a summer-only schedule and eventually dropped completely.", "Assurances of Memphis being an integral hub of the merged airline": "The expert's verdict mentions a quote from Anderson in a Memphis Daily News article, where he stated that the consolidation would bring more flights to Memphis, especially international flights. This indicates an assurance of Memphis being an important hub, but the subsequent reduction in flights and services contradicts this promise.", "Misrepresentations of assurances received by Rep": "Cohen: The expert's verdict mentions that Cohen's press release stated that some of the assurances he received were misrepresentations. While specific details of these misrepresentations are not provided, it suggests that Delta may have provided false or misleading information regarding their plans for Memphis.", "The history of broken promises": "The expert's verdict highlights that Cohen referred to a \"string of broken promises\" in his press release. This implies that there have been previous instances where Delta failed to fulfill their commitments or pledges made to Rep. Cohen and the people of Memphis."}
