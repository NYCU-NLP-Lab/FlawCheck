{"The statement is supported by a statement made by U": "S. Rep. Steve Rothman, who claimed that it costs more than a penny to make a one cent coin and more than a nickel to make a five cent piece. This provides a direct source of information to verify the claim.", "The claim is backed up by the U": "S. Mint's most recent annual report, which states that the total cost to produce and distribute a penny in 2010 was 1.79 cents, and a nickel cost the government 9.22 cents. This official report provides concrete evidence to support the claim.", "The U": "S. Mint has been losing money on producing smaller denomination coins since 2006, as stated in their annual reports. This information confirms that the claim about the cost of producing these coins is accurate.", "The Mint": "s decision to contract Concurrent Technologies Corporation to research and recommend less expensive metallic materials for coin production further supports the claim that the current production methods are costly. This action taken by the Mint indicates their acknowledgment of the issue and their efforts to find cost-saving alternatives."}
