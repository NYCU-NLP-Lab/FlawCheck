{"The claim of 1": "219,000 unemployed people in Australia was based on data compiled by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS).", "The claim was found to be misleading as the figures for": "unemployed\" and \"underemployed\" were actually compiled by market research company Roy Morgan in January 2018, not the ABS.", "The ABS": "s most recent employment summary for Australia showed a seasonally-adjusted unemployment figure of 711,500 for June 2019, which is significantly lower than the claim.", "The definitions used by Roy Morgan and the ABS to determine who falls into the categories of": "unemployed\" and \"underemployed\" differ, contributing to the discrepancy in their statistics."}
