{"The expert": "s verdict includes a quote from Conway where she cites \"the Mueller report, through the Barr memo\" to support her argument. This aspect highlights that Conway's claim was based on her interpretation of the information provided in Barr's memo, rather than the actual findings of the Mueller report.", "It is mentioned in the expert": "s verdict that Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein made the determination that the evidence was \"not sufficient\" to establish that Trump committed obstruction of justice. This aspect further supports the fact that the claim of \"no obstructive conduct\" is not accurate, as the determination made by Barr and Rosenstein is different from Conway's claim."}
