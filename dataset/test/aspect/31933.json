{"The claim was verified by comparing the corporate tax rates of different countries using the most straightforward definition of": "corporate tax rates\" provided by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). The OECD ranks the \"combined corporate income tax rate\" in its member nations, which includes the highest tax bracket for general corporate income.", "The expert also considered the recent changes in corporate tax rates": "specifically mentioning that Japan had recently cut its rate for 2011 by 5 percentage points, leaving the United States with the highest corporate tax rate among OECD nations.", "To provide a more comprehensive analysis": "the expert examined the \"effective tax rate\" rather than just the statutory rate. The effective tax rate takes into account deductions and other exclusions that many companies utilize, providing a more accurate representation of the actual tax burden on corporations. The World Bank's data on effective tax rates for 183 nations was used for this comparison.", "The expert acknowledged that while the U": "S. effective tax rate of 27.6 percent is lower than the published rate, it is still considered relatively high in a comparative sense. This aspect highlights the importance of considering both the statutory and effective tax rates when evaluating the claim."}
