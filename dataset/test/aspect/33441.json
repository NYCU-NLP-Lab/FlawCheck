{"The expert": "s verdict states that the GAO report found that 17 states have passed laws explicitly forbidding health plans from offering expanded coverage for abortion, while another 6 states severely restrict coverage. It also mentions that in 8 states, no expanded coverage is offered, in 15 states at least one plan offers such coverage, and in 5 states, all plans offer full coverage. This aspect provides specific data and statistics from the GAO report, indicating the variation in abortion coverage across different states."}
