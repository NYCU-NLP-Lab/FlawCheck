{"Location and Date": "The expert's investigation revealed that the original photograph was taken at the Folsom Street Fair in San Francisco on September 25, 2011, which is a different location and date from the Seattle anti-police-brutality protest zone in summer 2020.", "Performer Identification": "The expert determined that the individual in the photograph is a member of the Italian disco band Hard Ton, based in Venice, Italy, according to their Facebook profile. This contradicts the claim that the person represents \"antifa\" activists in Seattle.", "Misappropriation of Image": "The expert discovered that the image was misappropriated, as the antifa flag in the upper left corner was edited into the picture after it was taken. This manipulation further discredits the claim's authenticity.", "Lack of Response from Hard Ton": "The expert attempted to contact Hard Ton for comment regarding the misappropriation of their image but did not receive a response. This lack of response adds to the evidence that the claim is not valid."}
