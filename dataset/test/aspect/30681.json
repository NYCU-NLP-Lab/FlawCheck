{"Lack of credible sources": "The expert's verdict highlights that the claim originated from an article on a website called nofakenews.online, which is known for publishing deliberately false information and claims to be satire. This raises doubts about the credibility and reliability of the source.", "Inconsistent and unverifiable information": "The article in question mentions a van full of \"illegals\" being caught voting at multiple Alabama polling locations. However, there is no evidence provided to support this claim. Additionally, the article refers to a non-existent school and a non-existent State Election Integrity Board in Alabama, further undermining the credibility of the claim.", "Denial from official sources": "The Alabama Secretary of State's office, through its spokesperson, categorically denies the existence of a State Election Integrity Board and any reports of undocumented immigrants voting. The lack of official complaints or evidence from the Secretary of State's office contradicts the claim made in the article.", "National context and limited evidence": "While there have been instances of noncitizens voting in some states, the expert's verdict mentions that such occurrences are rare and represent a small fraction of the millions of votes cast nationwide. The claim fails to provide any substantial evidence or statistical data to support the assertion that a van full of undocumented immigrants was caught voting at multiple Alabama polling locations."}
