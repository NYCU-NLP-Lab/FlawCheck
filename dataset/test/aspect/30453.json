{"The claim made by Nancy Pelosi regarding a": "1.3 trillion tax break for corporations is based on the estimate provided by the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) that cutting the top corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent will reduce federal tax revenues by $1.35 trillion over 10 years.", "However": "Pelosi's claim ignores other tax changes in the new law that will increase taxes for corporations, resulting in a net savings of less than half of the estimated $1.3 trillion tax break.", "The new tax law": "in its entirety, is estimated to cut taxes by $1.5 trillion over 10 years for all taxpayers, including $1.1 trillion for individual taxpayers, according to the JCT.", "The JCT categorizes the tax changes in the new law into three categories": "individual tax reform,\" resulting in a net $1.1 trillion tax cut; \"international tax reform,\" resulting in a tax increase of $324 billion; and \"business tax reform,\" resulting in a net tax cut of about $654 billion. Other provisions in the law offset slightly more than half of the estimated revenue loss from reducing the corporate tax rate."}
