{"The source of the claim": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim was published on the World News Daily Report (WNDR) website, which is known for publishing fictional stories and is considered a fake news site. This raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Lack of corroborating evidence": "The expert's verdict states that there is no evidence or proof provided to support the claim that a woman named Janice Smith was arrested for training squirrels to attack her ex-boyfriend. This lack of evidence further questions the authenticity of the claim.", "Discrepancy in the mugshot": "The expert's verdict highlights that the supposed mugshot of Janice Smith accompanying the article is actually a photograph of Michelle Waro, a Maryland woman who was arrested in 2014 for a different incident. This discrepancy suggests that the image used to support the claim is unrelated and misleading.", "Satirical nature of the website": "The expert's verdict mentions that the World News Daily Report website includes a disclaimer stating that all of its content is satirical. This indicates that the article in question may not be intended to be taken seriously and further undermines the credibility of the claim."}
