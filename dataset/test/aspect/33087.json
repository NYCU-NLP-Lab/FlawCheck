{"Increase in homelessness": "The expert's verdict mentions that there has been an increase in homelessness in Colorado since the legalization of cannabis. This aspect is supported by statistics showing a 12.2 percent increase in homelessness between January 2013 and January 2017, making it the sixth-highest in-state increase in the nation.", "Unusually low base in 2013": "The expert's verdict also mentions that the 12.2 percent increase in homelessness is largely due to an unusually low base in 2013, caused by a significant decline of 42 percent between 2012 and 2013. This aspect suggests that the increase in homelessness may not be solely attributed to the legalization of cannabis.", "Average annual decline in homelessness": "Despite the increase in homelessness between 2013 and 2017, the expert's verdict notes that, on average, the number of homeless people in Colorado fell by six percent each year between 2012 and 2017. This aspect indicates that there has been an overall decline in homelessness in Colorado during the six-year period.", "Doubt over causal connection": "The expert's verdict highlights significant doubt over whether the legalization of cannabis caused or contributed to the increase in homelessness. While statistics show a correlation between the two, the verdict emphasizes that statistics can rise simultaneously without being linked. This aspect suggests that other factors may have influenced the increase in homelessness in Colorado."}
