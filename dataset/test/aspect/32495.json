{"Lack of official national tracking": "The expert mentions that there is no official national tracking of the number of people in jail due to being unable to afford bail. This lack of comprehensive data makes it difficult to verify the claim accurately.", "Extrapolation from Bureau of Justice Statistics data": "Researchers have used data from the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics to estimate the number of individuals in jail because they cannot afford bail. The bureau's 2018 report, based on 2016 data, states that there were 458,600 \"unconvicted\" people held in jails across the country. However, it is important to note that not all of these individuals were held solely due to their inability to pay bail.", "Ted Lieu": "s overestimation: The expert mentions that California Rep. Ted Lieu had previously made a related claim, stating that over 450,000 Americans sit in jail each day because they are too poor to pay bail. However, PolitiFact rated Lieu's claim as Half True, suggesting that he overestimated the total number.", "Hamilton Project report": "Bernie Sanders' campaign refers to a December 2018 report by the Hamilton Project, which is part of the Brookings Institution. The report states that there are more than 400,000 people in jail who could have been released if they had been able to post bail. However, the expert notes that this figure is higher than Sanders' claim of 200,000, indicating that the claim may not be entirely accurate."}
