{"The video was originally published by the Gaza Post and featured makeup artist Mariam Salah discussing her work in the Palestinian cinema special effects industry": "2. The video was repurposed by propagandists and shared as if it captured a group of people attempting to \"stage\" fake wounds and injuries to deceive the public about atrocities in Israel or Syria.", "Facebook pages such as": "Citizens Against the Reality of Terrorism\" and \"The Palestinian Lie\" labeled the footage as a \"fraud\" and claimed that the makeup artist was trying to make their oppression more believable and deceive everyone.", "Evidence from the video": "such as people wearing shirts for a \"special effect make-up\" outfit and openly speaking with news channels about their work, contradicts the claims made by those who labeled it as a deception."}
