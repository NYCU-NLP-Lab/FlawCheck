{"The claim is based on a tweet by a pollster": "Richard Baris, who stated that there are 132,000 voters flagged in voter files for change of address in Fulton County, Georgia, implying they could be ineligible to vote in that county.", "Georgia election officials have repeatedly stated that they have found no credible examples of election fraud in the state": "casting doubt on the claim's validity.", "The claim is solely based on the pollster": "s own queries of voter files, with no indication that he attempted to verify the legitimacy of his claim with election officials. This lack of independent verification raises concerns about the accuracy of the claim.", "The screenshots provided by the pollster do not include any detail or links that would allow others to replicate the search or verify its results": "further undermining the claim's credibility."}
