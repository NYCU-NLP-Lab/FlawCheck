{"Lack of credible news reports": "The expert found no news reports about Prime Minister Modi announcing a countrywide lockdown. If such an announcement had been made, it would have received widespread media coverage.", "Absence of official announcement on social media": "The expert noted that neither PM Modi nor the Prime Minister's Office made any announcement about a lockdown on Twitter. This indicates that no official communication was made regarding a countrywide lockdown.", "Focus on vaccine distribution": "On November 24, PM Modi held a meeting with chief ministers to discuss the provision and distribution of the coronavirus vaccine. Media reports from the meeting did not mention any announcement about fresh lockdowns, indicating that the focus was on vaccine distribution rather than imposing lockdowns.", "Imposition of restrictions by states": "While some states like Delhi, Gujarat, Rajasthan, and Haryana have imposed restrictions and curfews due to rising COVID-19 cases, these measures were not ordered by the central government. This suggests that there was no countrywide lockdown announcement by PM Modi."}
