{"The claim made by Gov": "Andrew Cuomo that \"70 million Americans have a criminal record \u2014 that\u2019s one in three adults\" was based on his statement in an article on career website LinkedIn.", "The FBI": "s definition of a criminal record includes individuals who have been arrested on a felony charge, even if they were not convicted. The FBI estimates that as of June 30, approximately 73.5 million people in the United States had a criminal record by their definition.", "The Census Bureau lists the adult population in the United States at 249": "4 million, which means that according to the FBI's definition, about 29.5 percent of adults have a criminal record.", "The term": "criminal record\" can have different interpretations, including convictions, arrests, or juvenile records. Without a clear distinction in Gov. Cuomo's claim, the exact meaning of \"criminal record\" remains ambiguous."}
