{"Lack of evidence": "The expert points out that there is scant data available regarding crimes committed by individuals living illegally in the United States in Texas. This lack of evidence raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Contradictory interpretations": "The expert highlights the contradictory interpretations of the claim made by Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick. While the claim initially suggests that \"criminal aliens\" were found guilty of 566,000 crimes, the smaller print accompanying the statement suggests that these crimes include charges, not necessarily convictions. This discrepancy raises questions about the accuracy of the claim.", "Percentage of arrests": "The expert mentions that, based on annual state-posted crime reports, the 170,000 arrests of \"criminal immigrants\" proclaimed by a Texas House member represented only about 4 percent of all adult arrests in the state from 2011 through 2015. This statistic challenges the credibility of the claim.", "Lack of clarification": "Despite being asked about the basis of his claim, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick's spokesperson provided a link to a familiar web page without offering any specific evidence or clarification. This lack of transparency further undermines the authenticity of the claim."}
