{"Lack of credible sources": "The expert's verdict highlights that the photographs were sourced from various individual hoaxes with varying backstories. The lack of credible sources and the fact that these images have not been featured in museums or scientific journals casts doubt on their authenticity.", "Digital manipulation": "The expert points out that many of the photographs are digitally manipulated. For example, one photograph includes an image of a giant skull that was added to a 1993 University of Chicago dinosaur dig photograph. This manipulation raises questions about the authenticity of the entire collection.", "Inconsistent narratives": "The expert's verdict mentions that the photographs were tied to different archeological discoveries in various locations, such as Greece, the Middle East, and India. These inconsistent narratives suggest that the photographs were created to fit different contexts, further undermining their authenticity.", "Lack of historical evidence": "The expert's verdict also highlights that there is no historical evidence supporting the existence of giant humanoids. The mention of biblical stories and references to giants from the days of the Bible do not provide concrete evidence for the authenticity of the claim."}
