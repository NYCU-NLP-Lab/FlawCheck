{"Timing conflict": "The expert points out that there is a timing conflict between the governor's vetoes in February and March and the job growth rankings from December 2009 to December 2010. This suggests that the claim of the governor's vetoes causing New Jersey's low job creation ranking may not be accurate.", "Inaccurate statement": "The expert highlights that the claim made by Assemblyman Lou Greenwald about the governor vetoing a \"30 bill job creation package\" is incorrect. The expert provides evidence that only 31 bills were submitted to the governor, and he signed 13 and vetoed 18.", "Legislative process": "The expert explains the legislative process and the status of the bills in question. They mention that 30 bills were passed by both the Assembly and the Senate, while two bills only passed in the Assembly and never reached the governor's desk. This information helps verify the accuracy of the claim.", "Lack of evidence": "The expert mentions that when asked about the source of Greenwald's job growth rankings, a spokesperson for the Assembly Democrats pointed to federal data from December 2009 to December 2010. This lack of specific evidence linking the governor's vetoes to the job growth rankings undermines the authenticity of the claim."}
