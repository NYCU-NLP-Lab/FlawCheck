{"The expert examined the historical context of Medicare to determine if there was a guarantee of benefits for seniors before the program was established in 1965": "They found that health coverage for seniors was not guaranteed prior to Medicare and Medicaid, as retirees often lost their employer-based coverage and couldn't afford new plans.", "The expert analyzed the current structure of Medicare as a defined": "benefit plan, which means it specifies the benefits provided rather than depending on the amount of money paid into the system. They concluded that Medicare does guarantee these benefits, and the government has a responsibility for them that would not exist in a defined-contribution scheme.", "The expert acknowledged that while Medicare guarantees that individuals will be served by the program once they turn 65": "it does not guarantee coverage for every possible service or treatment. They highlighted the existence of Medigap insurance plans, which fill the gaps in coverage for procedures not covered by Medicare, particularly for newly emergent technologies and treatments.", "The expert also pointed out that the guarantee of Medicare benefits may be subject to change": "as coverage for certain services or treatments that are currently covered could be altered in the future. This suggests that the guarantee of benefits under Medicare is not absolute."}
