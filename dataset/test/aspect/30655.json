{"Instant polls from DrudgeReport": "com, Time magazine, and Slate.com showed that a significant percentage of respondents believed that Donald Trump won the debate. This suggests that there was some support for his claim.", "However": "a more traditional survey conducted by Gravis Marketing on behalf of One America News Network found that Trump finished second in the poll, with Ben Carson winning a higher percentage of the vote. This contradicts Trump's claim of winning the debate.", "The Gravis Marketing poll also asked respondents who they thought lost the debate": "and 30 percent of respondents cited Trump as the loser. This indicates that there was a significant portion of the surveyed population who did not believe that Trump won the debate.", "The expert also noted that instant polls": "such as those mentioned above, are not always reliable as they do not represent a valid cross-sample of the electorate. This raises doubts about the accuracy and representativeness of the polls that supported Trump's claim."}
