The article revealed that the image was first published online on August 7, 2017, by Israel Ibeleme, a media aide to Nigeria's Minister for Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi. The image was taken during Amaechi's inspection of Agbor Station, which has now been renamed after Goodluck Jonathan and is part of the Itakpe-Ajaokuta-Warri rail line.", "Contextual information": "The claim was made in the context of a debate between supporters of President Muhammadu Buhari and his predecessor, Goodluck Jonathan, over who gets credit for recent rail projects in Nigeria.
