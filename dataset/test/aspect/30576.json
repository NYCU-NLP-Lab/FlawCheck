{"Lack of credible sources": "The claim about President Obama encouraging schools to teach the Quran for extra credit originated from various text-only updates on social media, without any reliable sources or links provided.", "Ambiguous and unsubstantiated content": "The rumor circulated for years with ambiguous status updates that made the claim without providing any concrete evidence or supporting information. It lacked specific details or verifiable facts.", "Misleading corroboration": "A February 2016 version of the rumor included a link that seemed to provide corroboration but instead led to unrelated content about teaching Islam in public schools in La Plata, Maryland. This demonstrated a lack of proper verification and misleading information.", "Author": "s admission of inaccuracy: The author of the article on dailytea.us, which initially propagated the claim, later admitted in the comments section that the information on the page was not accurate. This further undermined the authenticity of the claim."}
