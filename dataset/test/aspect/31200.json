{"The original source of the claim": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim was initially shared by Facebook user Manohar Bhardwaj and Twitter user @RashmiBhadoriy2. The expert verifies this by providing the exact posts and their respective captions.", "Image analysis": "The expert mentions that a reverse image search was conducted, which led to the discovery of the full-size image posted on Twitter in August 2019. They also found a blog post from August 17, 2013, which featured the same image and provided context about a protest in London. This analysis helps establish that the image is not recent and is unrelated to the ongoing farmers' protest.", "Verification of the protest": "The expert refers to the blog post and the tweet from Sikh Sangat news, both from 2013, which provide evidence of a protest in London where the same man in the image can be seen. This verifies that the image is indeed from a protest in London in 2013 and not related to the farmers' protest in India.", "Conclusion and clarification": "The expert concludes by stating that the image of a Sikh man desecrating the Indian national flag during a protest in London in 2013 has been falsely shared as part of the ongoing farmers' protest. This clarification helps debunk the claim and establish its inauthenticity."}
