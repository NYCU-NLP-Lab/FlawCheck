{"The claim made by President Trump that his policy is similar to President Obama": "s ban on visas for refugees from Iraq in 2011 is a faulty comparison, according to the expert's verdict.", "The delay in processing Iraqi refugees in 2011 was due to the discovery of two Iraqi refugees living in Kentucky who were involved in roadside bombing attacks on U": "S. troops in Iraq. This prompted a re-screening of thousands of Iraqi refugees in the U.S. and a backlog in processing.", "The Kentucky case led to an overhaul of the refugee screening process": "indicating that the actions taken by the Obama administration were in response to a specific threat and limited to one country.", "In contrast": "President Trump's executive order imposed a far wider ban, including Syrian refugees indefinitely and visitors from seven predominantly Muslim countries. The ban also initially applied to U.S. green card holders, causing confusion and criticism for overreaching his authority."}
