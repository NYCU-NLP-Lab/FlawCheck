{"Lack of specific evidence": "The expert found no research confirming that drinking two glasses of water after waking up \"activates internal organs.\" The claim is considered highly ambiguous as it does not define what \"activate\" means or specify which organs water is meant to activate.", "Lack of evidence for specific timing": "While it is somewhat true that water aids in the digestion process and prevents constipation, there is no evidence supporting the necessity of drinking water precisely 30 minutes before a meal.", "Contradictory evidence": "The claim that drinking a glass of water before taking a bath lowers blood pressure is not supported by any evidence. In fact, there is some evidence suggesting that drinking water may slightly raise blood pressure for certain individuals.", "Inconclusive evidence": "The expert found no evidence indicating that drinking water before going to bed has any effect on the likelihood of having a stroke or heart attack. Although hydration is generally beneficial for overall health, there is no specific evidence supporting the claim's assertion."}
