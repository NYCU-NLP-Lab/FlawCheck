{"Comparison of the video with previous reports": "The expert compared the video with previous reports and found that it was actually a year-old video from Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh. This helped verify that the claim of it being a video of women protesters fighting over money at Shaheen Bagh was false.", "Digital verification tool": "The expert used a digital verification tool called InVid to break the video into multiple keyframes. This allowed them to analyze the video more closely and gather evidence to support their conclusion.", "Reverse": "search on Google: One of the keyframes from the video was reverse-searched on Google, which led to the discovery of a report from News 24. This report confirmed that the video was from Bhopal and not from Shaheen Bagh, further debunking the claim.", "Corroborating reports": "The expert found additional reports from Dainik Bhaskar that described the incident in the video as a scuffle between four women over a minor traffic collision. These reports provided further evidence to support the conclusion that the video was unrelated to the claim of women protesters fighting over money."}
