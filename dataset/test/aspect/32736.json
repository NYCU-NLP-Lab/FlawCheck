{"The current COVID": "19 survival rate in the U.S. is not 98.54%, as claimed in the Facebook post. This information is constantly changing in an ongoing pandemic.", "Mortality rates and survival rates vary widely based on demographics and reporting practices": "It is important to note that not everyone with the disease is getting tested, which affects the accuracy of the statistics.", "A 98": "54% survival rate may sound optimistic, but it actually implies that COVID-19 is about 10 times more lethal than the seasonal flu.", "The figures provided in the claim are unsourced and seem to be overly optimistic": "It is crucial to rely on reliable sources and understand that the calculations include individuals who are still sick and have neither died nor recovered."}
