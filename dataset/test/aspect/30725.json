{"The claim suggests boiling orange peels with cayenne pepper and inhaling the steam to release mucus from the nasal passages": "claiming that mucus is where the virus lives. However, the expert's verdict states that there is no evidence to support this claim and that boiling water and seasoning is not proven to protect against COVID-19.", "The spelling errors in the claim": "such as \"wit\" instead of \"with\" and \"yo\" instead of \"your,\" indicate that the advice may not be reliable or accurate. This inconsistency in language usage may have tipped off the expert to question the validity of the claim.", "The post containing the claim was flagged by Facebook as part of their efforts to combat false news and misinformation": "This suggests that the claim may not be trustworthy and should be approached with skepticism.", "The World Health Organization": "WHO) has listed lemon and turmeric as unproven cures for COVID-19, and there is no evidence to suggest that oranges or cayenne can cure the virus either. This further discredits the claim and reinforces the lack of scientific evidence supporting its effectiveness."}
