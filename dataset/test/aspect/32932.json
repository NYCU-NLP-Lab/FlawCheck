{"The expert refers to a report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service that outlines the eligibility criteria and calculation method for pension benefits for members of Congress": "This report provides concrete evidence to verify the claim.", "The expert mentions the specific provisions of the pension program": "which state that no member of Congress is eligible for any pension unless they have served in Congress for at least five years. This information directly contradicts the claim that members can retire with the same pay after only one term.", "The expert explains the age and service requirements for collecting a pension": "stating that a member of Congress must be at least 62 years old, or at least 50 years old with 20 years of service, or any age with 25 years of service. This information further supports the fact that retirement benefits are not granted after just one term in office.", "The expert provides an example using a typical 25": "year rank-and-file member who retired, demonstrating how the pension is calculated based on salary, years of service, and a multiplier. This example illustrates the actual process and criteria for determining the pension amount, which again refutes the claim made in the original statement."}
