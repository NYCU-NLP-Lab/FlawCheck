{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the role of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton in leading America into a deal that will arm Iran. The expert's verdict clarifies that the Iran deal does not actually arm Iran with conventional weapons or nuclear weapons, and that the deal forced Iran to destroy or remove nuclear equipment and promise never to build or buy a nuclear weapon.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the assertion that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton are responsible for leading America into a deal that will arm Iran. The expert's verdict provides evidence that contradicts this claim, such as the fact that the United States usually doesn't like doing business with Iran in terms of arms dealing and that the Iran deal actually aims to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Iran deal will arm Iran without providing any specific evidence or mention of how this would occur. The expert's verdict points out that the claim is broader and lacks specific mention of nuclear weapons, which have been addressed in previous PolitiFact articles.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests an alternative explanation for the claim made by Senator Richard Burr, stating that the Iran deal gives Iran more money and access to buy other non-nuclear weapons. This alternative explanation contradicts the claim that Obama and Clinton are responsible for leading America into a deal that will arm Iran.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not providing accurate information about the Iran deal and its implications. The expert's verdict provides a more accurate assessment of the Iran deal, highlighting the limitations and restrictions it imposes on Iran's nuclear capabilities.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement in the claim or the expert's verdict.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the Iran deal actually aims to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. The expert's verdict provides evidence to support this fact, such as the destruction or removal of nuclear equipment and the loss of enriched uranium required by the deal."}
