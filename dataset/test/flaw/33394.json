{"Lack enough support": "The claim that \"almost half of all vehicles stolen in Texas each year had keys left inside\" lacks enough support as it is not backed up by reliable data or evidence.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the statement made by the Texas Department of Motor Vehicles is accurate and reliable, without questioning its methodology or sources.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's investigation contradicts the claim made by the sheriff and finds faulty key facts, indicating that the claim is not entirely accurate.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the actual percentage of vehicles stolen with keys left inside, as it only mentions \"almost half\" without providing a specific percentage.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration publication suggests that 40-50% of vehicle thefts nationally can be attributed to driver error, which includes leaving keys in the ignition or on the seats. This alternative explanation suggests that there are other factors contributing to vehicle thefts besides keys left inside."}
