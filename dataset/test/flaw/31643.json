{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent of the problem by stating that \"half of the state has no insurance company\" and that \"the other half is gonna lose the insurance company.\" In reality, all eight rating areas in Tennessee have at least one insurance company and only five rating areas have one carrier.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that all rating areas in Tennessee have at least one insurance company on the ACA marketplace.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or data to back up the assertion that \"half of the state has no insurance company\" or that \"the other half is gonna lose the insurance company.\"", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the situation in Tennessee under Obamacare is a disaster without providing any evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation is that the withdrawal of Humana from the ACA marketplace in the greater Knoxville area may leave some parts of the state without marketplace coverage next year, but this does not necessarily mean that \"half of the state has no insurance company.\""}
