{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the number of Wisconsinites who have voted to raise their own property taxes. While it is true that a significant number of voters have supported referendums for additional school funding, it is unclear if it reaches the claimed \"more than a million\" figure.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the role of local school districts in proposing referendums and the autonomy they have in deciding to raise taxes. It suggests that Republicans' failure to fully fund schools is the sole reason for the increase in property taxes, overlooking the agency of local districts in making these decisions.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that Republicans have failed to fully fund public schools for the past eight years. It does not provide specific details or statistics to back up this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes a direct causal relationship between Republicans' failure to fully fund schools and the decision of Wisconsinites to raise their own property taxes. It does not consider other factors that may influence voters' decisions, such as the specific needs of local districts or the overall economic situation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not explore alternative explanations for the increase in property taxes, such as changes in local demographics, shifts in educational priorities, or the impact of inflation on school funding.", "Contradict fact": "There is no clear contradiction of fact in the claim. However, the lack of specific evidence or data to support the claim makes it difficult to determine if any contradictory information exists."}
