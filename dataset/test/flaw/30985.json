{"Lack enough support": "The claim that the pipe bombs were never mailed lacks enough support as it is based on a Facebook post and does not provide any substantial evidence or verification.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of postage stamps on the package is not sufficient to cover the weight of a pipe bomb, which may be a problematic assumption as it does not take into account the actual weight of the package or the specific postal regulations.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that a Florida man named Cesar Sayoc Jr. was arrested for sending the explosive packages, as stated in the federal criminal complaint.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim ignores the alternative explanation that the package shown on Facebook may have been a different package or a replica, rather than the actual package sent by Sayoc.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by relying on a single Facebook post and not considering other reliable sources or official reports regarding the mailing of the pipe bombs.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance of the Facebook post and its implications regarding the mailing of the pipe bombs, without providing substantial evidence to support the claim.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the weight and size of a pipe bomb, assuming that it would require more postage stamps than what was shown on the package. However, the actual weight and size of the package may be within the limits covered by the stamps."}
