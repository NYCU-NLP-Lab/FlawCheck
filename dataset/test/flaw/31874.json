{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or sources to back up the statement that Robert Reich published a list of ten rules to resist the Trump administration in 2018.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the list of rules was authored by Robert Reich, but it is later clarified that he did not write it. This assumption is problematic as it misrepresents the true authorship of the list.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation exists for the list of rules, which is that it was not actually authored by Robert Reich but was falsely attributed to him. This alternative explanation is supported by Reich's own statement denying authorship.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Robert Reich did not write the list of rules, as confirmed by his own statement.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance of the list of rules by stating that it was published to \"help resist\" the Trump administration. Without proper evidence, it is unclear what the true intentions or purpose of the list were.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by presenting conflicting information, such as initially stating that Robert Reich published the list of rules, but later clarifying that he did not write it."}
