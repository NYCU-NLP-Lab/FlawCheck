{"Lack enough support": "The claim that condoms \"used to be tax-exempt here in Texas\" is supported by the expert's findings of changes in law and a news story, but it lacks further evidence or specific details to fully support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the change in the statute was the reason for condoms being taxed again, but it does not provide enough information to support this assumption. It is possible that there were other factors or alternative explanations for the change in taxation.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that condoms were exempt from sales tax in Texas for more than seven years, as stated by the expert. The claim implies that condoms were never tax-exempt, which is incorrect.", "Understate": "The claim understates the duration of time that condoms were tax-exempt in Texas. The expert's verdict states that condoms were not subject to sales tax for more than seven years, but the claim does not provide this information accurately.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not providing a clear timeline or specific details about the change in law and the subsequent taxation of condoms. It is not fully clear when the change occurred or why it was made.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the change in taxation of condoms, such as political motivations or public health concerns. It only focuses on the wording of the statute as the reason for the change."}
