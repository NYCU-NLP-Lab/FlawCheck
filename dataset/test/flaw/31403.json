{"Understates": "The claim underestimates the impact and significance of the video showing the augmented reality dragon flying over the baseball stadium. It states that \"some social media users seemed a bit confused about what this video actually showed,\" implying that the confusion was limited or insignificant.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that viewers were aware that the footage didn't actually show a real mythical creature's visit to a ball game. This assumption may not be accurate for all viewers, as some may have believed the dragon was real.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the statement that the dragon was only viewable via a screen. While it mentions that the dragon was visible on the stadium's large LED screen and home televisions, there is no further evidence provided to confirm this.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the video, such as the possibility of it being a hologram or CGI. It only briefly mentions these possibilities but does not explore them further or provide any evidence to support or refute them.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the dragon was visible on the stadium's large LED screen and home televisions. It states that the dragon was not visible to the naked eye, but this contradicts the previous statement about it being visible on screens.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the confusion or misunderstanding of some social media users regarding the video. It implies that there was significant confusion, but it does not provide sufficient evidence or examples to support this claim."}
