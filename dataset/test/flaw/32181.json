{"Exaggerate": "The claim may have exaggerated the incident by stating that the Chick-Fil-A employee told Erica Thomas to \"go back\" to her country, while the actual statement made by the customer involved cursing at her.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that the Chick-Fil-A employee made the specific statement mentioned.", "Falters at times": "Erica Thomas herself appeared uncertain about the exact words used by the customer, stating that he made \"those types of references\" but not specifically mentioning \"go back\" to her country.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the incident at a Publix grocery store, involving a different customer, is the same incident that occurred at a Chick-Fil-A restaurant."}
