{"Contradict fact": "The claim that \"Richard Nixon was the last president to be impeached\" contradicts the fact that Bill Clinton was actually the last president to be impeached.", "Understate": "The claim understates the fact that Nixon was never actually impeached, as impeachment requires a formal vote, and the House only voted to impeach two presidents before Nixon.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or sources to back up the statement.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Nixon was the last president to be impeached without considering the historical context and the impeachment of Bill Clinton.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation exists, as the claim fails to acknowledge that Bill Clinton was impeached after Nixon's resignation."}
