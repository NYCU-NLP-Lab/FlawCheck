{"Understates": "The claim may understate the level of security provided by EMV technology and the protection it offers to cardholders. The expert's verdict highlights that EMV cards are harder to counterfeit and provide additional authentication and security during transactions, but this information is not explicitly mentioned in the claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the assertion that swiping a chipped card at a point-of-sale terminal makes the cardholder liable for fraudulent transactions. The expert's verdict provides information that contradicts this claim by stating that cardholders remain protected from liability regardless of whether their EMV cards are swiped or dipped.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that swiping a chipped card instead of inserting it into the reader makes the cardholder liable for fraudulent transactions. However, the expert's verdict highlights that liability for fraud does not shift based on the method of processing the EMV card.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or possibilities for liability in cases of fraudulent transactions. The expert's verdict suggests that liability is determined between the merchant and the card issuer, and cardholders are not held responsible.", "Contradicts fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that cardholders are not liable for fraudulent transactions, as stated in the expert's verdict. The claim implies that swiping a chipped card makes the cardholder liable, which is not supported by the expert's information.", "Exaggerates": "The claim may exaggerate the potential liability faced by cardholders when swiping a chipped card. The expert's verdict clearly states that cardholders are protected from liability, regardless of the method of processing the EMV card."}
