{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the Golden State Fence Company was fined for hiring illegal immigrant workers specifically for building part of the US-Mexico wall. The company was fined for hiring unauthorized aliens in general.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that the Golden State Fence Company was hired to build part of the US-Mexico wall. There is no evidence provided to support this specific claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the fine imposed on the Golden State Fence Company is directly related to their involvement in building the US-Mexico wall, which is not supported by the evidence. The fine was for hiring unauthorized aliens, and their work on the border fence was prior to the court complaint about their hiring processes.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation exists that the company's work on the border fence was part of Operation Gatekeeper, a push to curtail illegal immigration from Mexico under then-president Bill Clinton. This suggests that their involvement predates the current focus on building the US-Mexico wall."}
