{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the difference in support for the surge between the two candidates, implying that Romney did not support it at all.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Romney did not support the surge.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that supporting the surge is a significant factor in evaluating the candidates' positions on the Iraq war.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim ignores the possibility that both candidates may have had different opinions or approaches to the surge, but still ultimately supported it.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Romney publicly supported the surge when it was announced by President Bush.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in accurately representing the candidates' positions by selectively choosing certain statements while ignoring others.", "Understate": "The claim understates the complexity of the candidates' positions on the surge by reducing it to a simple binary of support or non-support."}
