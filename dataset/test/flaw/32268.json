{"Exaggerate": "The claim of the state budget increasing \"over 80 percent\" under Rick Perry is an exaggeration. The actual increase is 53 percent when certain factors are taken into account.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict mentions that there was an error in calculating the percentage increase, indicating that the claim falters in terms of accuracy.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict points out that the claim lacks enough support as it does not provide a detailed breakdown of the budget increase and factors influencing it.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that a budget increase of over 80 percent is inherently negative without considering the reasons behind the increase or the benefits it may have brought.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides alternative explanations for the budget increase, such as the inclusion of federal stimulus aid and a shift in spending from school property taxes, suggesting that the claim does not consider these factors."}
