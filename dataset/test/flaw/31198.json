{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the dropout rate by stating that \"as many as a quarter of our students aren't even finishing high school.\" The expert's analysis suggests that measuring dropout rates is complex and there are different ways to calculate them, indicating that the claim may not be entirely accurate or precise.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's analysis indicates that the statistic used in the claim is an imperfect measurement and that there are different ways of calculating dropout rates. This suggests that the claim may lack sufficient supporting evidence or data to accurately assess the dropout rate of American high school students.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's analysis mentions that the decline in enrollment between freshman year and graduation, known as the averaged freshman graduation rate (AFGR), does not necessarily distinguish between students who dropped out and those who left for other reasons. This alternative explanation suggests that the claim may not provide a comprehensive understanding of the reasons behind the decline in high school graduation rates.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that a high dropout rate is economically unsustainable and morally unacceptable. While this may be a commonly held belief, it is subjective and does not necessarily reflect the views of all experts or stakeholders. The claim's assumption may be problematic as it does not consider potential counterarguments or alternative perspectives.", "Falters at times": "The expert's analysis mentions that the measurement of dropout rates is complex and can be subject to error. This suggests that the claim may falter at times in accurately representing the true dropout rate of American high school students.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the dropout rate by stating that \"as many as a quarter of our students aren't even finishing high school.\" The expert's analysis indicates that there are different ways of measuring dropout rates and that it is an imperfect measurement. This suggests that the actual dropout rate may be higher than what the claim suggests."}
