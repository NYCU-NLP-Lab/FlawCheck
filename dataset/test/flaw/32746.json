{"Exaggeration": "The claim describes a \"week-long uncontrollable sex drive\" in hundreds of sheep after drinking water contaminated with Viagra. This could be seen as an exaggerated or sensationalized description.", "Lack enough support": "The claim is based on an IANS news feed that credits the story to a website called worldnewsdailyreport. It is not clear if there is sufficient evidence or credible sources to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the behavior of the sheep is directly caused by drinking water contaminated with Viagra. This assumption may not be supported by scientific evidence or logical reasoning.", "Contradict fact": "It is stated that the website worldnewsdailyreport publishes satire, and their logo reads \"where facts don't matter.\" This contradicts the claim that the story is true.", "Falters at times": "The fact that some media outlets initially published the story but later took it down suggests that there may have been some doubts or inconsistencies in the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "Without more information, it is possible that there could be alternative explanations for the reported behavior of the sheep, such as a different environmental factor or natural mating behavior."}
