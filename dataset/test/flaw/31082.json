{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the role of the 22nd Amendment in preventing President Franklin D. Roosevelt from being re-elected, as it was not specifically targeted at him and he had already passed away before the amendment was implemented.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it fails to provide evidence or factual information to support the assertion that the 22nd Amendment was passed solely to prevent Roosevelt's re-election.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that the 22nd Amendment was directly aimed at President Roosevelt, when in fact, it was a response to the concerns raised by his multiple re-elections.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that President Roosevelt died in 1945, while the 22nd Amendment was ratified in 1947. Therefore, it is not possible for the amendment to have been passed to prevent his re-election.", "Understate": "The claim understates the historical context and the broader reasons behind the introduction of the 22nd Amendment, which were influenced by concerns over the potential for unlimited terms in the presidency.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation is that the 22nd Amendment was introduced to prevent any future president from serving more than two terms, in order to avoid potential consolidation of power and maintain democratic principles. This alternative perspective is not acknowledged in the claim."}
