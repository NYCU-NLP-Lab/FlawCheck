{"Lack enough support": "The claim is based on a report from 2000, which may not be the most up-to-date or comprehensive data available.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the guns recovered in crimes are directly linked to licensed dealers, without considering the possibility of illegal transactions or guns changing hands multiple times.", "Understate": "The claim may underestimate the percentage of licensed dealers supplying guns recovered in crimes, as the 2000 report found that 1.2 percent of dealers accounted for more than 57 percent of crime guns traced.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the source of guns used in crimes, such as illegal sales or guns obtained through other means.", "Falters at times": "The claim may not fully acknowledge the limitations and caveats of the 2000 report, as well as the fact that the ATF no longer uses it to evaluate current crime trends."}
