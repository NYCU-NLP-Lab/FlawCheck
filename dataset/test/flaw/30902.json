{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the progress made towards the president's goal to cut greenhouse gas emissions. The expert's verdict states that the emissions had fallen by 11.8 percent compared to 2005, which is more than halfway towards the goal of 17 percent.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the impact of factors other than the substitution of natural gas for coal in the power sector on the progress towards the goal. The expert's verdict mentions that improvements in energy consumption and the decline in the use of coal also contributed to the reduction in emissions.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support as it does not provide specific data or evidence to back up the statement that \"about half of the progress is because of the substitution of natural gas for coal in the power sector.\" The expert's verdict mentions the impact of natural gas on emissions but does not provide specific data on the exact contribution.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim may make a problematic assumption that the substitution of natural gas for coal in the power sector is the primary driver of progress towards the goal. The expert's verdict mentions other factors such as improvements in energy consumption and the decline in coal use that also contributed to the reduction in emissions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim may not consider alternative explanations or factors that could have contributed to the progress towards the goal. The expert's verdict mentions that energy consumption cratered when the economy collapsed, which would have led to lower emissions, and also highlights concerns over environmental side effects of natural gas production."}
