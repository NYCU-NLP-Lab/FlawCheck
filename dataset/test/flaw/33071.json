{"Lack enough support": "The claim is supported by a blog entry from the pilot, but there may be a lack of additional evidence or sources to corroborate the story.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the letter from the airline pilot accurately describes a flight on which the remains of a fallen U.S. soldier were carried. However, without further evidence, it is possible that the story could be exaggerated or fabricated.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is a possibility that there could be alternative explanations for the events described in the claim. Without further information or evidence, it is difficult to determine if there are other factors or circumstances that could have influenced the situation."}
