{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent of coverage for everyone living in poverty under Medicaid in Wisconsin. While it is true that more people living in poverty are covered under Medicaid, it does not mean that all individuals living in poverty are covered.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not providing enough context or explanation for how exactly everyone living in poverty is covered under Medicaid in Wisconsin. It fails to mention the specific actions taken by Governor Scott Walker to achieve this result.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the assertion that everyone living in poverty is covered under Medicaid in Wisconsin. It does not provide any data or evidence to support this claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for how everyone living in poverty is covered under Medicaid in Wisconsin. The claim mentions that Governor Scott Walker pushed less-poor people off of Medicaid and into the marketplace set up under Obamacare, which could be seen as a different approach to expanding coverage.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Governor Scott Walker turned down a Medicaid expansion under Obamacare. While he may have found alternative ways to expand coverage, it is not accurate to say that he turned down the Medicaid expansion offered under Obamacare.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that turning down the Medicaid expansion under Obamacare was a difficult decision in a blue state like Wisconsin. It assumes that accepting the expansion would have been more politically challenging, without providing evidence to support this assumption.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the impact of Governor Scott Walker's actions in expanding coverage for the poor in Wisconsin. It mentions that he made historic progress in insuring Wisconsin's poor, but does not provide enough information to fully evaluate the extent of this progress."}
