{"Lack enough support": "The claim of 40 percent of U.S. gun sales occurring outside of licensed gun dealers is not supported by specific evidence or a credible source. It is based on estimates and statements from advocacy groups.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all gun sales occurring outside of licensed gun dealers are done without a criminal background check. This may not be the case as some private sellers voluntarily conduct background checks.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the percentage of gun sales occurring outside of licensed dealers, such as individuals selling firearms to family members or friends without going through a licensed dealer."}
