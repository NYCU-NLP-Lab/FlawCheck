{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the wage gap between Wisconsin and Minnesota by stating that the typical Wisconsin worker makes $5,000 less each year than their neighbors in Minnesota. The actual gap is around $5,060 according to one source and $5,757 according to another source.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it only cites one source for the wage gap data and does not provide additional evidence or studies to back up the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the wage gap is solely due to Gov. Scott Walker's policies, without considering other factors that may contribute to the gap, such as historical trends or economic factors.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert mentions that the wage gap between Minnesota and Wisconsin has existed since the 1960s and has gradually grown, suggesting that there may be other factors at play beyond just the policies of Gov. Scott Walker."}
