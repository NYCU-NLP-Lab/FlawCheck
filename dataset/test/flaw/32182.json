{"Contradict fact": "The claim falsely presents the person in the photo as a Sri Lankan shaman who claimed to have a miracle cure for Covid-19, while the expert's verdict clarifies that the person is actually C.B. Ratnayake, a Sri Lankan minister receiving a Covid-19 vaccine. This contradicts the fact presented in the claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim provides a photo and a statement, but it lacks sufficient evidence or supporting information to prove the accuracy of the claim. The expert's verdict, on the other hand, provides detailed information, including the original source of the photo and statements from the office of C.B. Ratnayake, which support the conclusion that the claim is false.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim presents the photo as evidence that the Sri Lankan shaman is receiving the Covid-19 vaccine, but the expert's verdict offers an alternative explanation by identifying the person in the photo as C.B. Ratnayake, a Sri Lankan minister. This alternative explanation undermines the claim's assertion.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the person in the photo is the Sri Lankan shaman who claimed to have a miracle cure for Covid-19. However, this assumption is proven to be false by the expert's verdict, which identifies the person as C.B. Ratnayake, a different individual altogether.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of the photo by presenting it as evidence of the Sri Lankan shaman receiving the Covid-19 vaccine. However, the expert's verdict clarifies that the photo is unrelated to the shaman and instead shows a Sri Lankan minister receiving the vaccine.", "Understate": "There is no clear understatement bias in this claim as it does not downplay or minimize any aspect or information."}
