{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that \"when you're white ... you don't know what it's like to be poor.\" This statement ignores the fact that there are white individuals who have experienced poverty.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it fails to provide evidence or data to back up the assertion that white individuals do not know what it's like to be poor.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that being white automatically means one has not experienced poverty. This assumption overlooks the diversity of experiences within the white population.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for poverty beyond race, such as socioeconomic factors, education, or systemic issues."}
