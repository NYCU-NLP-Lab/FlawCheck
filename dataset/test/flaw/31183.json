{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which liberals in County Hall want the community to be a sanctuary county, as there is no evidence to support this assertion.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no legislation introduced by any legislator, liberal or otherwise, to designate Erie County as a sanctuary county.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all liberals in County Hall want the community to be a sanctuary county without providing any evidence or specific individuals who hold this view.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation provided by the spokesperson for the New York Republican State Committee, who claims that the mailer refers to legislation introduced by Republican Legislator Ted Morton in December 2016, which aimed to reaffirm Erie County as a non-sanctuary county."}
