{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the story of the goose sheltering the puppy from the cold. The images and the story's origin are questionable, and there is no corroborating reporting or evidence of the incident happening in Montana.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the images and story are true without providing concrete proof or verification. It relies on the assumption that the images accurately depict a real event.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the images have been circulating on Chinese social media since 2017, suggesting that the incident did not occur in Montana as claimed.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The alternative explanation is that the images and story may be fabricated or misrepresented, as they have been circulating on Chinese social media for several years before going viral in the United States.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the skepticism and doubts raised by Snopes and other sources regarding the authenticity and origin of the images and story. It does not fully address the potential inconsistencies and lack of evidence.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing a clear and accurate account of the incident, as it does not disclose when or where the images were taken and fails to mention that the bird was stuck to a pole.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the emotional impact and significance of the story by stating that \"we have so much to learn from animals\" and describing the friendship between the goose and the puppy as \"beautiful\" without sufficient evidence to support these claims."}
