{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerated because it states that the president of the University of Texas has raised four-year student graduation rates to 75 percent, while the expert's findings indicate that the rates have ranged from 52 to 53 percent during the president's tenure.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or data to back up the assertion that the president has raised graduation rates to 75 percent.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the president is solely responsible for the increase in graduation rates without considering other factors or individuals involved in the process.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the increase in graduation rates, such as changes in policies, initiatives, or external factors that have contributed to the improvement.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the graduation rates during the president's tenure have ranged from 52 to 53 percent, not 75 percent.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not providing a clear and accurate representation of the graduation rates and the president's role in improving them."}
