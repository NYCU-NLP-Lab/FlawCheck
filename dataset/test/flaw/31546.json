{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the situation by suggesting that Pennsylvania residents are being told to quarantine for potential COVID-19 exposure and \"face possible arrest\" if they try to vote. The expert's verdict clarifies that Pennsylvania voters who are told to quarantine can still vote and can request and return an emergency absentee ballot.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the quarantine letters sent by the state Department of Health are an attempt to silence voters. The expert's verdict states that there is no evidence to support this assumption and that the claim is misleading.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that Pennsylvania residents are being prevented from voting or threatened with arrest for not obeying the quarantine order. The expert's verdict provides a more accurate explanation of the quarantine letters and the voting rights of Pennsylvania residents.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Pennsylvania voters who are under quarantine can still vote through emergency absentee ballots. The expert's verdict clarifies this fact and debunks the claim.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in the provided claim."}
