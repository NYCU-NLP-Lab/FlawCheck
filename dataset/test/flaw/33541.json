{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or credible sources to support the statement that it is impossible to find oil in northern Nigeria. The only sources provided are from a website known for sharing false information and social media posts, which do not provide reliable evidence.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the statement made by Kathryn Sullivan herself, who denies ever making such a comment and states that it is beyond her expertise. This contradiction undermines the credibility of the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the $1 billion invested in oil exploration in northern Nigeria was wasted and should have been invested in education. However, this assumption is not supported by any evidence or expert opinion. It is a subjective judgment that may not reflect the reality of the situation.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance of finding oil in northern Nigeria by suggesting that it has the potential to transform impoverished parts of the region. While oil discoveries can have economic benefits, the claim does not provide enough evidence to support such a transformative impact.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in this claim."}
