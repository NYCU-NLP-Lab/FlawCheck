This contradicts the claim that Myanmar will acquire a Covid-19 medication and vaccine.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that as of October 14, 2020, the WHO has not announced the approval or mass production of a Covid-19 vaccine. This contradicts the claim made in the Facebook post.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understating bias in the provided claim.", "Falters at times": "There is no evidence of the claim faltering at times in the provided information."}
