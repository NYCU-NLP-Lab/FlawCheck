{"Exaggerate": "The claim of a $15-per-hour minimum wage raising the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38 is described as far from accurate and not supported by evidence by multiple economists.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the actual impact of a $15-per-hour minimum wage on Taco Bell burrito prices, as Taco Bell already operates in places with higher minimum wages and their burrito prices have not skyrocketed.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that a $15-per-hour minimum wage would result in a $38 Taco Bell burrito.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The alternative explanation provided by Taco Bell and economists is that Taco Bell has already adapted to higher minimum wages in certain locations without significantly increasing burrito prices."}
