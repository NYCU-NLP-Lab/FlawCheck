{"Exaggerate": "The claim suggests that the early start to Daylight Saving Time in 2007 contributed to record high temperatures across the U.S. This may be an exaggeration as it assumes a direct causal relationship between DST and global warming.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that an extra hour of daylight from DST has a warming effect on the climate without providing sufficient evidence or scientific support for this assumption.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or scientific studies to support the assertion that the early start to DST in 2007 contributed to global warming.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim suggests that the early start to DST in 2007 may be a plot by a liberal Congress to make people believe in global warming. This alternative explanation lacks evidence and may be a biased assumption.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by presenting anecdotal evidence of hot weather in March and the presence of bugs and snakes in Arkansas, but fails to establish a direct link to DST or global warming.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that DST only shifts the time of day that daylight hours occur and does not create an \"extra\" hour of daylight."}
