{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered an exaggeration because it states that 95 percent of income gains have gone to the top 1 percent, which implies a significant disparity.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific evidence or data to support the statement that 95 percent of income gains have gone to the top 1 percent.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that income gains are the only measure of inequality and does not consider other factors such as consumption or wealth accumulation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for income inequality, such as changes in government assistance programs or the inclusion of non-wage income sources.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in its accuracy due to the limitations of the data used, such as excluding certain types of income and using preliminary data for some years.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that income gains may not have exclusively gone to the top 1 percent, as there may have been income growth for other income groups as well.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the income gains for the top 1 percent if there are additional income sources or factors not considered in the analysis."}
