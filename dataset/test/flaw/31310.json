{"Exaggerate": "The claim suggests that the FBI \"wiped\" phones belonging to eyewitnesses, implying a deliberate and intentional action. However, there is no concrete evidence provided to support this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The only evidence provided to support the claim is a Facebook post from a Las Vegas resident. This single source is not sufficient to establish the veracity of the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the FBI's actions of returning personal items and taking the shooter's electronic belongings to their laboratory are evidence of them wiping witnesses' phones. However, this assumption is not supported by any concrete evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that InfoWars and its editor are pushing a conspiracy theory narrative, suggesting a cover-up by the FBI and local law enforcement. This alternative explanation raises doubts about the accuracy and credibility of the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing a clear and substantial argument or evidence to support the assertion that the FBI wiped witnesses' phones. It relies heavily on speculation and conspiracy theories.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the FBI began returning personal items to the concert goers, including cell phones, without any mention of wiping or deleting data. The claim is therefore inconsistent with the reported actions of the FBI.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understating bias in this claim."}
