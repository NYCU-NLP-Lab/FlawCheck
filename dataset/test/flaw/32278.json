{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the effectiveness of a diet rich in vitamin D in reversing tooth decay and regrowing portions of teeth lost to cavities. The expert's verdict highlights that the study cited to support the claim was published in 1932 and its conclusions were not accurately represented.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as the study cited to back it up is outdated and its findings were not accurately portrayed. The expert's verdict mentions that the study's actual conclusions were different from what was claimed.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that tooth decay can be completely reversed and portions of teeth lost to cavities can be regrown solely through a diet rich in vitamin D. However, the expert's verdict points out that the study cited did not provide enough evidence to support such a claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim ignores alternative explanations for the improvements observed in the study. The expert's verdict mentions that the improvements in cavities could have been attributed to the grain-free diet and nutrient-rich foods followed by Group 3, rather than solely to the vitamin D supplement.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that tooth decay is generally considered irreversible once it sets in. The expert's verdict mentions that the claim of reversing tooth decay is questionable and that many people believe it to be impossible.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in the claim."}
