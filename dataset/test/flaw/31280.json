{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks documented evidence or first-hand knowledge to support the assertion that crabs imported from China are injected with formalin. The source of the information is unspecified and based on hearsay.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the photographs document crabs injected with formalin, but it is later revealed that the images actually show crabs injected with seawater to increase their weight. This assumption is incorrect.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The alternative explanation is that the crabs in the photographs were injected with seawater, not formalin. This alternative explanation contradicts the initial claim.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the crabs in the photographs were not injected with formalin, but with seawater to increase their weight.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential harm of injecting crabs with formalin by labeling it as a \"highly toxic substance.\" Formalin is actually a dangerous formaldehyde solution that can be harmful to human health.", "Exaggerate": "There is no evidence to support the claim that crabs imported from China are commonly injected with formalin. The claim may exaggerate the extent of this practice.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing accurate information about the origin and labeling of the photographs, as well as the actual practice of injecting crabs with formalin. It lacks consistency and clarity."}
