The expert's verdict mentions that the list has been widely circulated, but it does not provide any empirical data or research to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that following the safety tips will effectively prevent victimization in random violent crimes. However, this assumption is not supported by any evidence or data.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or factors that may contribute to victimization in random violent crimes.
