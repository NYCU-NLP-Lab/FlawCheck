{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Hillary Clinton's rejection of efforts to make it easier to vote and harder to cheat defies not only logic but also the will of the majority of Americans. The evidence provided only shows that a majority of Americans support voter ID laws, but it does not prove that Clinton's rejection defies logic or the will of the majority.", "Lack enough support": "While the claim provides some evidence in the form of poll results, it does not provide enough support to conclusively prove that Clinton's rejection defies logic or the will of the majority of Americans. The evidence only shows support for voter ID laws but does not directly address Clinton's stance or the overall will of the majority.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that making it easier to vote and harder to cheat solely relies on implementing voter ID laws. It does not consider other potential solutions or approaches to achieve these goals, which could exist.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Clinton's rejection of efforts to make it easier to vote and harder to cheat. It assumes that her stance is solely based on opposition to voter ID laws, without considering other potential reasons or concerns she may have.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by presenting the evidence of public support for voter ID laws but does not directly address Clinton's specific stance or provide a comprehensive analysis of the issue. It relies on general poll results without delving into the nuances of the topic.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement in the claim.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not contradict any specific facts presented in the evidence. However, it does make a general statement about defying logic and the will of the majority without providing sufficient evidence to support this assertion."}
