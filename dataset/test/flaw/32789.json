{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks supporting evidence or citations to verify the alleged promise of $300.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the promise of $300 was made solely to influence the resident's vote for Hillary Clinton, without providing concrete evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert suggests that the claim falls in line with other unsubstantiated allegations against Clinton, implying that there could be alternative explanations or motives behind the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim is based on a video posted online, which may not be reliable or verifiable evidence.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential impact of the alleged promise on the election, as it focuses on a single resident in a halfway house rather than considering the broader context of the election.", "Contradict fact": "It is mentioned that the claim is \"unequivocally false\" based on the unlikelihood of paying each voting resident of a halfway house and the lack of supporting evidence.", "Exaggerate": "There is no clear evidence of exaggeration in the claim itself, but the expert's verdict suggests that the claim is far-fetched and lacks credibility."}
