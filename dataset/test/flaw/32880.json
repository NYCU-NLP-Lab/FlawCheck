{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which the death penalty for blasphemy is enforced in Muslim countries. The expert's verdict mentions that out of 50 countries listed with a Muslim majority, only five have definitive state laws stating that the punishment for blasphemy against Islam, Allah, or Mohammad is death.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or data to support the assertion that there is a death penalty for blaspheming Mohammad in Muslim countries. The expert's verdict mentions that they turned to various sources to assess the claim, but it does not explicitly state whether there is sufficient evidence to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all Muslim countries follow Sharia law and enforce a death penalty for blaspheming Mohammad. However, the expert's verdict mentions that Sharia law is open to interpretation and that there are multiple interpretations of the \"way\" embodied in the fiqh.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the presence of a death penalty for blasphemy in Muslim countries, such as cultural or political factors. The expert's verdict mentions that the death penalty can result from blasphemy charges in some majority-Muslim countries, but it does not explore the reasons behind this.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times by not providing a comprehensive analysis of the issue. The expert's verdict mentions that they compiled a chart to see how different countries handle blasphemy, but it does not provide a detailed analysis of the findings or address potential limitations in the data.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the severity of the punishment for blasphemy in some Muslim countries. The expert's verdict mentions that the death penalty can be enforced against \"blasphemers\" by lynch mobs in Pakistan, suggesting that the punishment may go beyond state laws."}
