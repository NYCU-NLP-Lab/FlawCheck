{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the statement that Providence alone spent $50,000 a year notifying the school department about residents in the state's sex offender registry.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the $50,000 spent by Providence was solely for notifying the school department, when in fact, it was stated that most of the cost was related to notifications to schools, but not exclusively.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the actual costs associated with notifying the school department and other entities about sex offenders, as it only mentions the cost for Providence and does not provide a comprehensive view of the expenses incurred by other communities.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that under the proposed bill, the responsibility for notifying residents, schools, and community organizations would shift from city and town police departments to the Rhode Island Department of Public Safety, which suggests that the current system may not be as costly as claimed.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the impact of the proposed bill on reducing notification costs for cities and towns, as it only mentions the possibility of e-mail notifications without providing concrete evidence or estimates of the potential savings."}
