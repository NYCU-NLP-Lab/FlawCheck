{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the difference in hours and pay between British and German workers. The expert's verdict mentions that it takes a German worker four and a half days to produce what a UK worker produces in five days, which may suggest a smaller difference than implied in the claim.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the difference in productivity between British and German workers. The expert's verdict states that it takes German workers less than four hours to make what UK workers make in five hours, indicating a potentially larger productivity gap.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific evidence or data to support the comparison between British and German workers' hours and pay. The expert's verdict provides some data on the productivity gap but does not offer extensive support for the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the UK's productivity gap with other developed countries and London's productivity compared to the rest of the UK may be influenced by factors other than just the hours and pay of workers. This suggests that alternative explanations for the productivity gap exist.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that longer working hours and lower pay are the main factors contributing to the productivity gap between British and German workers. However, the expert's verdict highlights that productivity is not solely determined by working hours and pay, but also by factors like infrastructure, education, management, and technology.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact mentioned in the expert's verdict that, on average, it takes German workers four and a half days to make what UK workers make in five days. The claim implies that German workers produce in four days what UK workers make in five.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in accurately representing the productivity gap between British and German workers. The expert's verdict mentions that there is no single answer to the productivity puzzle and the reasons for the gap are likely to be multiple factors at play, indicating a more complex situation than suggested in the claim."}
