{"Exaggerate": "The claim that Joe Biden wants to ban fracking is exaggerated. Biden himself has stated that he does not oppose fracking and has no intention of shutting down the industry.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Biden has explicitly stated he does not oppose fracking and has no plans to ban it.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no concrete evidence or statements from Biden indicating his intention to ban fracking.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that Biden's stance on ending subsidies for fossil fuels and transitioning to clean energy automatically means a ban on fracking.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation is that Biden's campaign is focused on transitioning to clean energy and reducing dependence on fossil fuels, but not necessarily banning fracking altogether."}
