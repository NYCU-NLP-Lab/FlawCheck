{"Understate": "The claim understates the increase in marijuana use among high school students in Colorado since legalization.

The evidence provided only includes data from one survey and does not consider other potential factors or sources of information.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the 2015 survey accurately represents the trend in marijuana use among high school students in Colorado. However, it does not consider the possibility of fluctuations or inconsistencies in the survey methodology or sample.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the observed increase in marijuana use among high school students. It solely focuses on the lack of statistical significance, without exploring other potential factors that could contribute to the rise in usage."}
