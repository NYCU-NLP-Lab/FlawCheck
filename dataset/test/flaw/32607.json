{"Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that the Department of Revenue's annual report pegs the decrease in property taxes at $2.9 billion, while a report prepared for a Senate committee puts the number at about $2.28 billion. This discrepancy in the numbers suggests a lack of enough support for the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the decrease in property taxes is solely due to tax cuts and lower property values. However, the expert's verdict mentions that it is unclear how much of the drop in property taxes can be attributed to tax reforms and how much is a result of falling property values. This assumption is problematic as it oversimplifies the factors contributing to the decrease in property taxes.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict states that it is uncertain how much of the decrease in property taxes is due to tax reforms and how much is a result of falling property values. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the decrease in property taxes, such as economic factors or changes in property assessments, which are not considered in the claim."}
