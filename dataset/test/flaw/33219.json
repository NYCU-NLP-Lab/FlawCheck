{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of Trump's tax plan by stating that it would rack up $30 trillion in debt, while the analysis actually suggests a range of $11.2 trillion to $34.1 trillion over a 20-year period.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific details or sources for the independent analysts who made the findings.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Trump's tax plan is solely given to the wealthy and big corporations, without considering any potential benefits or impacts on other groups.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative scenarios or studies, such as the one by Moody's, which project smaller debt increases based on different assumptions and compromises.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential impact of Trump's tax plan by focusing on the $30 trillion figure, which is the highest estimate, rather than considering the range of estimates provided by different analyses."}
