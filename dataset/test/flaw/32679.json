{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the cost of the health care overhaul by stating that it will cost $1.76 trillion over 10 years, which is well above the $940 billion originally claimed by Democrats.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide enough support or evidence for the stated cost of $1.76 trillion.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the initial cost estimate of $940 billion by Democrats was accurate and that the new estimate of $1.76 trillion is a contradiction.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the difference in cost estimates, such as changes in the program or additional factors that may have influenced the new projection.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by comparing \"apples to oranges\" and not taking into account plan features that will offset some of the costs, such as new taxes and penalties.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the actual cost of the health care overhaul by only focusing on the gross cost estimate without considering additional factors.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the statement made by Ted Cruz, which is similar to the claim, was found to be false by PolitiFact National."}
