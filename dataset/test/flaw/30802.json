{"However": "some potential biases that can be inferred are:", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough evidence or support to prove that Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi were breaking the lockdown and Section 144. The incident mentioned in the claim actually occurred in December 2019, unrelated to the ongoing lockdown.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the viral video of Delhi police performing a security check on a car, in which Priyanka Gandhi was sitting, is evidence of them breaking the lockdown and Section 144. However, it does not provide any concrete evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the presence of Priyanka Gandhi in the car during the security check, which are not explored in the claim. It is possible that she had a valid reason to be out during the lockdown and Section 144."}
