{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the success of New Zealand in dealing with COVID-19 by stating that they have \"zero COVID cases\" as of the date of the claim. In reality, there were 22 active cases at that time, all detected at the port of entry among New Zealanders returning from overseas travel.", "Understate": "The claim understates the number of confirmed and probable cases in New Zealand during the outbreak, which is reported to be 1,540 cases, including 22 deaths. This is not mentioned in the claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to fully validate the statement that New Zealand's success in dealing with COVID-19 is solely due to letting health experts make decisions rather than politicians. The role of both health experts and politicians, along with the willingness of New Zealanders to abide by stay-at-home orders, are credited for the country's success.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the sole reason for New Zealand's success in dealing with COVID-19 is the involvement of health experts in decision-making, while neglecting other factors such as public compliance and adherence to measures.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for New Zealand's success, such as the country's geographical isolation, early implementation of strict measures, and effective contact tracing and testing strategies.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that New Zealand had 22 active cases of COVID-19 at the time of the claim, all detected at the port of entry.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not providing a comprehensive and accurate representation of the situation in New Zealand regarding COVID-19 cases. It presents a simplified and incomplete picture of the country's success."}
