{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent to which major retailers have begun keeping Tide brand laundry detergent PODS under lock and key. While some retailers have implemented this measure, it does not necessarily apply to all major retailers.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that major retailers have implemented the lock and key measure solely to prevent people from eating the detergent pods. The evidence provided suggests alternative reasons such as theft prevention.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the lock and key measure is a direct response to the Tide PODS challenge, without considering other potential factors such as theft or prior security measures.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The evidence presented in the expert's verdict suggests alternative explanations for the lock and key measure, including theft prevention and pre-existing security measures."}
