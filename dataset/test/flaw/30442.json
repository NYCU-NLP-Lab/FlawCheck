{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the annual cost of free tax credits paid to illegal immigrants by stating that it quadrupled to $4.2 billion in 2011. The expert's verdict clarifies that the actual figure is from 2009 and is not specific to illegal immigrants.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement in the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by using an incorrect year (2011 instead of 2009) and by attributing the entire $4.2 billion to illegal immigrants, when it includes a broader range of individuals.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it only provides a statement from Trump's campaign without additional evidence or sources.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the entire $4.2 billion in tax credits is paid to illegal immigrants, when it includes a mix of individuals with different immigration statuses.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is no alternative explanation mentioned in the claim or the expert's verdict."}
