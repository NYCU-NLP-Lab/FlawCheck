{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent to which coal usage is restricted, stating that \"We're practically not allowed to use coal anymore.\" This is an overstatement as coal still remains a significant source of electricity generation in the United States.", "Understate": "The claim understates the impact of coal usage in China by stating that they \"spew it in the air.\" While China does have significant air pollution issues, it is an oversimplification to solely attribute it to coal shipped from other countries.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that coal is being shipped to China and causing air pollution. It does not provide any specific statistics or sources to back up this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that shipping coal to China is the main reason for air pollution in the country without considering other factors such as industrial emissions, vehicle pollution, and local coal usage.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the reduction in coal usage in the United States, such as tighter government regulations, lower natural gas prices, and changing consumer and industry preferences."}
