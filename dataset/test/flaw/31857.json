The expert's verdict mentions that there is no proven connection and that alternative explanations cannot be ruled out.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes a direct causal relationship between the Fukushima radiation and the mortality of orca whale infants without providing substantial evidence. The expert's verdict highlights the lack of evidence and the need for further investigation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the mortality of orca whale infants, other than radiation from Fukushima. The expert's verdict mentions that other factors, such as natural causes or environmental changes, could be contributing to the observed deaths.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there is no proven connection between the Fukushima radiation and the mortality of orca whale infants. The expert's verdict emphasizes the absence of evidence supporting this claim.", "Falters at times": "It is unclear whether the claim falters at times, as the provided information does not explicitly mention any inconsistencies or contradictions within the claim.", "Understate": "The claim does not understate the impact of radiation from Fukushima on orca whale mortality, as it exaggerates the effect by stating a 100% infant mortality rate."}
