{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the tax rate in Travis County by stating that it is the highest urban county tax rate in Texas, when there is evidence to suggest that Hidalgo County had a higher rate in 2012 and 2013.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only compares the tax rate in Travis County with a subset of counties that are home to the state's five largest cities, rather than considering all urban counties in Texas.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the comparison of tax rates should only be limited to counties with \"big cities\" that are often compared to other big cities around Texas, which may not accurately represent all urban counties in the state.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the differences in tax rates between counties, such as variations in local government spending priorities or economic factors, that are not considered in the claim."}
