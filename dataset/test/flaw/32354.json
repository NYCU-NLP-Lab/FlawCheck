{"Exaggerate": "The claim by President Donald Trump that doctors said 'they've never seen a body kill the coronavirus' like his body appears to be an exaggeration. The expert's analysis states that Trump never made such a statement in any of his videos, and there is no evidence to support this claim.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that President Trump did not make any statements about his body or his DNA in the videos he posted during his COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence or documentation provided to verify the statement made by President Trump.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that President Trump's body was exceptional in its ability to fight off the coronavirus, which is a problematic assumption without sufficient evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation could be that President Trump's recovery was due to the medical treatments he received, such as the Regeneron antibody therapy, rather than any unique qualities of his body."}
