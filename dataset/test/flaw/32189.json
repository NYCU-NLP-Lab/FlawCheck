{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the lack of women and children among Syrian refugees by stating that \"there aren't that many women, there aren't that many children,\" when in fact, the data shows that over 50% of the refugees are female and over 50% are children.", "Understate": "The claim understates the number of women and children among Syrian refugees by implying that there are very few of them, when the data shows that they make up a significant portion of the refugee population.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on anecdotal evidence and personal observations rather than verifiable data.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the assumption that the absence of women and children among Syrian refugees is unusual or suspicious, without providing any evidence or justification for this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert suggests that the claim may be referring to a different population of refugees (Europe's mass influx of refugees and migrants) rather than the U.N.-registered refugees in camps, indicating that there may be alternative explanations for the observed demographics."}
