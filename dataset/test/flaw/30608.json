{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the difference in water reuse between San Antonio and Austin, stating that San Antonio reuses almost 40 percent while Austin only reuses about 5 percent. The actual numbers provided by the experts show that San Antonio reuses about 35 percent and Austin reuses about 4.3 percent.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any specific data or evidence to back up the statement that \"that's not right\" and \"we can do better\". It is a subjective opinion without sufficient evidence.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the level of water reuse in San Antonio is the standard that Austin should strive for, without considering the differences in infrastructure, resources, and specific needs of each city.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the difference in water reuse between San Antonio and Austin. The experts point out that San Antonio uses most of its recycled water in ways that Austin cannot, such as filling urban rivers and sending water to power plants downstream.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the actual numbers provided by the experts, which show that San Antonio reuses about 35 percent of its water, not almost 40 percent as stated in the claim.", "Understate": "The claim understates the actual level of water reuse in Austin, stating that it is about 5 percent when the experts provide a more precise number of 4.3 percent.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not accurately representing the facts and providing misleading information about the water reuse percentages in San Antonio and Austin."}
