{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the gender pay gap by stating that American women only earn 80 cents for every dollar a man earns for doing the same job, without considering other factors such as degrees, jobs pursued, time taken off for childcare, hours worked, and years of experience.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or data that directly compares men and women occupying the same jobs.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the gender pay gap is solely due to pay discrimination between men and women doing the same work, without considering other factors that contribute to the disparity.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the gender pay gap, such as differences in career choices, job preferences, and work-life balance decisions made by individuals.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that other studies have shown a significantly smaller wage gap between men and women holding the same jobs, such as the 2013 study by the American Association of University Women which found a 7 percent wage gap.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by misrepresenting the statistics and generalizing the gender pay gap without considering specific job comparisons."}
