{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the involvement of George Soros in paying the group of people to join the migrant caravan and storm the US border. There is no evidence to support this claim.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the video was shot in Guatemala, not Honduras, as stated by the Congressman. This contradicts the accuracy of the claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the accusation that George Soros paid the group of people in the video.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that the individuals in the video were paid to join the caravan, when in fact they were already part of it.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim ignores the alternative explanation that the individuals in the video were given money to help them get by, rather than being paid to join the caravan.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in accurately representing the location of the video, as it was initially claimed to be from Honduras when it was actually from Guatemala."}
