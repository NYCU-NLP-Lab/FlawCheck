{"Understate": "The claim may understate the number of deaths by only mentioning the 23 deaths reported in Norway, without providing information about deaths in other countries or the overall number of vaccinations administered.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to establish a direct causal relationship between the COVID-19 vaccine and the reported deaths. The expert's verdict states that the association with vaccination is speculative and unproven.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim may make a problematic assumption by implying that the deaths were directly caused by the COVID-19 vaccine without considering other factors or pre-existing health conditions of the individuals who died.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that common adverse reactions to mRNA vaccines, such as fever and nausea, could have contributed to a fatal outcome in some frail patients, indicating that there may be alternative explanations for the deaths.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the headlines reporting the deaths should not be interpreted as evidence that the vaccine itself caused these deaths. The expert's verdict clarifies that the deaths were recorded for safety studies, even when the causal relationship appears unclear.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance of the reported deaths by not providing the context that the primary people being vaccinated in Norway were elderly individuals in nursing homes, who may have a higher risk of mortality due to various factors unrelated to the vaccine.", "Falters at times": "It is difficult to determine if the claim falters at times without more specific information. However, it may be considered to falter if it fails to acknowledge the limitations of the reported deaths and the need for further investigation to establish any causal relationship with the vaccine."}
