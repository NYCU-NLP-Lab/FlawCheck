{"Lack enough support": "The claim is based on a self-selected group of parents reporting their children's negative reactions to wearing masks, which may not be representative of the general population. The data collected is subjective and lacks standardized descriptions or a control group.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all the negative impacts reported by parents were caused by wearing masks, without considering alternative explanations or factors that could contribute to the children's reactions.", "Falters at times": "The claim's source, an Instagram post from a website selling supplements, raises questions about its credibility and reliability.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert suggests that some of the reported negative reactions may have been unrelated to wearing masks, such as children who were always reluctant to go to kindergarten or other factors not considered in the study.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the positive impacts of wearing masks on children's health and safety, as public health doctors recommend masks for children over 2 years old.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the negative impacts of masks on children by stating that 68% of children experienced \"major negative impacts\" without clarifying the severity or duration of these impacts.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the expert's statement that public health doctors recommend masks for children over 2 years old, suggesting that masks have negative impacts on the majority of children."}
