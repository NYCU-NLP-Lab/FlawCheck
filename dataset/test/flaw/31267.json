{"Lack enough support": "The claim that the headstone of Capt. Khan references his \"dying as an apostate\" lacks support as there is no evidence or documentation provided to verify this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the absence of rhetoric declaring Capt. Khan as an \"apostate\" on his headstone proves that the claim is false. However, this assumption may not be accurate as the absence of such rhetoric could be due to various reasons.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the \"apostate\" claim originated with Islamic State propaganda, suggesting an alternative explanation for the claim rather than it being true.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the guidelines provided by Arlington National Cemetery, which state that headstones do not include atypical epitaphs like the one claimed in the rumor.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as an exaggeration as it presents a sensationalized and controversial statement about Capt. Khan's headstone without sufficient evidence to support it."}
