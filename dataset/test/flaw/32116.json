However, it is later clarified that the image is unrelated to Uganda and instead depicts expelled pregnant girls in Tanzania.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation is that the image used in the claim is not related to girls returning to school in Uganda after the pandemic shutdown, but rather depicts expelled pregnant girls in Tanzania attending vocational training at the Faraja Center.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the situation by suggesting that girls have returned to school in Uganda after the pandemic shutdown without providing sufficient evidence or verifying the accuracy of the image used.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in the provided claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in accurately representing the situation of girls returning to school in Uganda after the pandemic shutdown. It relies on an unrelated image and lacks sufficient evidence or support.", "Other potential biases": "It is difficult to determine other biases without additional context or information."}
