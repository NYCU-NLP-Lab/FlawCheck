{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that people in New Zealand are eating on banana leaves inspired by India. The only evidence provided is a photo that has been shared on social media, but there is no verification of its authenticity or location.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the photo circulating on social media is from New Zealand and that it represents a trend of Indian culture becoming popular in the country. However, there is no concrete evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for the photo, suggesting that it was actually taken in Kerala's Sivananda Ashram. This alternative explanation contradicts the claim that the photo shows people in New Zealand.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict contradicts the claim by stating that the photo is falsely being circulated as people from New Zealand taking inspiration from Indian culture. This contradicts the claim that the photo represents a trend in New Zealand.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the complexity of the situation by simplifying it to a single photo and assuming a direct connection between New Zealand and India. The expert's verdict highlights the need for further investigation and verification of the photo's origin and context.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by relying on social media posts and unverified sources as evidence. The expert's verdict points out the limitations and inconsistencies in the available information.", "Exaggerate": "There is no clear evidence of exaggeration in the claim or the expert's verdict."}
