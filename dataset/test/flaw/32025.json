{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of radicalized Muslims by using the highest percentages available in surveys to maximize the number.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the assertion that over 800 million Muslims are radicalized.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that blaming someone other than al-Qaida for the 9/11 attacks equates to being radicalized, which may not be a valid assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that extremists represent only a tiny minority of Muslims, as acknowledged by defenders of religious tolerance.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the diversity and complexity of Muslim beliefs and practices by categorizing a large number of Muslims as radicalized without considering individual variations.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the survey results, such as political or social factors influencing respondents' answers.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by using a broad definition of radical and not providing a clear and consistent criteria for labeling individuals as radicalized."}
