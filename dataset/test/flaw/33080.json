{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or sources to back up the assertion that the photos show a protest against electronic vote machine tampering in India in May 2019.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for the photos, as they have been circulating online since at least 2017 in reports about protests regarding alleged tampering with electronic voting machines in different Indian cities. This suggests that the photos may not be specifically related to the claimed protest in May 2019.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Prime Minister Narendra Modi won a landslide victory in the Indian elections held between April 11 and May 19, 2019, according to an AFP report. The claim implies that there was a protest against electronic vote machine tampering during this period, which is inconsistent with the reported election results.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance of the protest by stating that the \"whole Surat city is boiling on the roads.\" This statement implies a widespread and intense protest, but there is no evidence provided to support this level of exaggeration.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by presenting misleading information. The photos have been circulating since at least 2017, which contradicts the claim that they show a protest specifically in May 2019. Additionally, the claim implies that the protest is not covered by media organizations, but the photos have been published in articles by Outlook India magazine and Scroll.in.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that the photos are evidence of a protest against electronic vote machine tampering. However, there is no clear evidence or context provided to support this assumption.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understating bias in the provided claim."}
