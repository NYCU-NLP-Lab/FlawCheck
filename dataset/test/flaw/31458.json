{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerated as the expert's verdict states that the death rate for those without a high school education is 2.7 times higher, while the claim states it is two-and-a-half times higher.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or data to back up the statement.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the higher death rate among those without a high school education.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes a direct causal link between lack of high school education and higher death rates without considering other factors that may contribute to the disparity.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the severity of the difference in death rates as the expert's verdict states that the gap is even worse than initially claimed."}
