{"Exaggerate": "The claim of a 40% increase in COVID rates after reopening is contradicted by the data, which shows a 12% decrease in cases.", "Lack enough support": "The claim is based on a post that briefly appeared on Forbes.com, which was later withdrawn. There is no firm data available to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in COVID cases is directly caused by the reopening of Georgia, without considering other factors that may have contributed to the increase.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The data suggests that there was a smaller increase in cases after the reopening compared to the period before the change, indicating that there may be alternative explanations for the increase in COVID rates."}
