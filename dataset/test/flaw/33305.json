{"Understate": "The claim may understate the number of states where employment discrimination based on sexual orientation is legal. The claim states that \"in 29 states in this country you can still get fired for not just being gay, but if your employer thinks you are gay.\" However, the expert's verdict mentions that 21 states plus the District of Columbia explicitly prohibit employment discrimination based on sexual orientation, leaving only 29 states without such protections. This suggests that the claim may be understating the number of states where discrimination is prohibited.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific evidence or data to support the assertion that in 29 states one can still be fired for being gay or if their employer thinks they are gay. It does not provide any specific examples or statistics to back up this statement.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that being fired for being gay or perceived as gay is a widespread issue in the 29 states mentioned. However, it does not provide any context or evidence to support this assumption. It is possible that the extent of such discrimination varies across different states and industries.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for employment termination. It solely focuses on sexual orientation as the reason for potential firing, without acknowledging other potential factors that can lead to termination.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there are 21 states plus the District of Columbia that explicitly prohibit employment discrimination based on sexual orientation. The claim's assertion that in 29 states one can still be fired for being gay or perceived as gay contradicts the existence of these legal protections in some states.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the prevalence and severity of employment discrimination based on sexual orientation. Without providing specific evidence or data, it is difficult to determine the extent of the problem in the mentioned 29 states."}
