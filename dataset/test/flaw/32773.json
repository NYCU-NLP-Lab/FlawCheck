{"Lack enough support": "The claim that Abraham Lincoln declined to make a Supreme Court nomination just before the 1864 election because he felt the \"American people deserve to make the decision\" lacks evidence or support. The expert states that there is no evidence of Lincoln expressing or acting upon this sentiment.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Lincoln's decision not to nominate a Supreme Court justice was solely based on the belief that the American people should decide. However, the expert points out that there were other factors at play, such as managing a fractious coalition, securing re-election, and planning for reunification with the Confederate states.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert suggests alternative explanations for Lincoln's decision, such as the logistical impossibility of filling the open Supreme Court seat before the election due to Congress being in recess. This suggests that there may be other reasons for Lincoln's delay in making a nomination.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by presenting Lincoln's decision as solely motivated by the belief that the American people deserve to make the decision, without considering other factors or evidence.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Lincoln could not have filled the open Supreme Court seat prior to the election due to Congress being in recess. Therefore, his decision not to nominate a justice was not solely based on the belief that the American people should decide."}
