{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the likelihood of dying after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine compared to the flu vaccine. The expert's verdict states that there is no proof that people are dying from COVID-19 vaccines, and the comparison is faulty.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on unvetted information submitted to a federal database. The expert's verdict states that the suggestion that COVID-19 vaccines are killing one in every 10,000 immunized people is groundless.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the reported deaths after COVID-19 vaccinations are directly caused by the vaccines, which is a problematic assumption. The expert's verdict states that the vaccines have undergone rigorous testing and no serious safety issues have been identified.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the authorized and approved COVID-19 vaccines are effective at preventing severe COVID-19. The expert's verdict states that the vaccines have been shown to be effective in preventing symptomatic illness and reducing the risk of getting sick by more than 90%.", "Understate": "The claim understates the effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccines against severe disease, hospitalization, and death. The expert's verdict acknowledges that the vaccines are still good at preventing hospitalization or death, particularly if someone stays up-to-date on vaccination.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the reported deaths after COVID-19 vaccinations, such as coincidental factors or underlying health conditions. The expert's verdict suggests that the deaths are likely coincidental and not directly caused by the vaccines.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by relying on unvetted information and misusing the numbers from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). The expert's verdict states that the comparison is faulty and the suggestion of increased danger from COVID-19 vaccines is groundless."}
