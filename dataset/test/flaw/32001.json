{"Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or sources to support the assertion that the tank is inside a Thai temple in September 2020.

This assumption is not supported by any evidence or logical reasoning and is purely speculative.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the photo in question was published on the website of Thailand's Defence Technology Institute in 2012, indicating that the photo is not recent and does not depict a tank inside a temple in September 2020.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the significance of the photo by not providing enough information about its historical context and the purpose of the tank's presence in the temple. Without further explanation, it is difficult to determine the true significance or purpose of the tank's presence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the presence of the tank inside the temple, such as it being a display or exhibition piece, a historical artifact, or a part of a religious ceremony. However, the claim does not explore or consider these alternative explanations.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not providing a comprehensive analysis or investigation into the origins and context of the photo. It relies on limited information and does not thoroughly examine all available evidence or sources.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the implications of the photo by suggesting that it is evidence of war preparations involving children. Without more information or evidence, such a claim is speculative and potentially exaggerated."}
