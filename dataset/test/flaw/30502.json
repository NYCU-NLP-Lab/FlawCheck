{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the Pope's Instagram account \"liked\" a racy image of a Brazilian model. The only evidence provided is a screenshot captured by the model's management company, which may not be conclusive proof.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Pope himself or his team intentionally \"liked\" the racy image. However, it is not clear if the \"like\" was a deliberate action or a mistake by someone managing the account.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the \"like\" on the racy image. It is possible that the account was hacked or that someone unauthorized had access to the account and \"liked\" the image without the knowledge of the Pope or his team.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the significance of the incident by not highlighting the potential impact it had on the Pope's reputation or the reaction it received from the public and media.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the \"like\" was removed from the image after it was reported by news outlets. This contradicts the implication that the Pope's Instagram account continued to endorse the racy image."}
