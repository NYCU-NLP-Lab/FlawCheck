{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as an exaggeration because it presents the one-in-five statistic as a trend, when in fact, the percentage of \"illegal aliens\" sentenced for murder in 2016 was notably higher than in previous years.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide evidence for a broad trend and instead cites a single year's number from the U.S. Sentencing Commission.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of federal murder charges against illegal aliens represents a significant portion of overall murder cases nationwide, which may not be accurate.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the statistics, such as variations in enforcement and prosecution practices at the state level.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by presenting imprecise descriptions and cherry-picking data to support the argument.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity of the issue by oversimplifying the relationship between illegal immigration and murder rates.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there is no comprehensive or consistent data on the number of overall murders committed by immigrants in the country illegally."}
