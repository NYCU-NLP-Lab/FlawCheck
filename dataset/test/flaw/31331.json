The expert's verdict states that the figure is \"nearly one in four,\" but does not provide a specific percentage or number.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all people in their prime working years who are not working want to work. The expert's verdict does not provide evidence to support this assumption.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that they looked at the \"employment-to-population ratio\" for ages 25 to 54, but it does not provide further data or analysis to support the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that some people in their prime working years may choose not to work during childbearing and child-rearing years. This alternative explanation suggests that the claim may not accurately reflect the reasons why people in this age range are not working.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict contradicts the claim made by Donald Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign that the unemployment rate may be 42 percent. The verdict states that this claim is false.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent of the issue by stating that \"nearly one in four people\" in their prime working years are not working. The expert's verdict does not provide a specific percentage or number to support this claim.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim by Donald Trump is \"much closer to the mark\" compared to his other statements about the labor market. This suggests that the claim may still have some inaccuracies or flaws."}
