{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the cleaner was the only person allowed to sit at the Kaaba shrine during the pandemic. The expert's verdict states that the photo has been doctored and misrepresented, and that there were other people present near the shrine.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a doctored image and does not provide any credible evidence or sources to back up the assertion.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the cleaner being allowed to sit at the Kaaba shrine during the pandemic is a result of Allah choosing him over others, implying a religious bias or assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the alternative explanation that the cleaner may have been allowed to sit at the Kaaba shrine for a specific reason unrelated to his status or Allah's choice, such as performing a cleaning or maintenance task."}
