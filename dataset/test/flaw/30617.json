{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Breitbart leaked the names of four Democrats being charged in Mueller's Russia probe, when in fact, no such leak occurred.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or credible sources to back up the assertion that Breitbart leaked the names.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the leaked names are accurate and that the individuals mentioned are actually Democrats being charged in Mueller's probe, without providing any evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation for the claim is that it was a fake news story created by a self-described liberal troll, Christopher Blair, who creates fictional stories to fool conservatives."}
