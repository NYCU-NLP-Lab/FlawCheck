{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Obamacare will provide insurance to all non-U.S. residents, even if they are here illegally. The expert's verdict clarifies that this statement is wrong and provides evidence to support this.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Obamacare does not provide insurance to non-U.S. residents who are here illegally. The expert's verdict explains that these individuals are ineligible for regular Medicaid coverage and cannot obtain coverage through state-based health insurance exchanges.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or sources to back up the statement. The expert's verdict, on the other hand, provides detailed information and references to explain why the claim is incorrect.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Obamacare will provide insurance to all non-U.S. residents, even if they are here illegally. This assumption is problematic because it is not supported by the facts and the expert's verdict clarifies the actual provisions of Obamacare.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not provide an alternative explanation for why Obamacare would provide insurance to non-U.S. residents who are here illegally. The expert's verdict, however, provides alternative explanations by stating that certain low-income illegal immigrants may be eligible for emergency Medicaid coverage, but this predates the Affordable Care Act and is not the same as regular health insurance coverage."}
