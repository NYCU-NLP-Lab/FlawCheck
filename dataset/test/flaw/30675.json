It may oversimplify a complex issue.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the disparity in maternal mortality rates, such as differences in underlying health conditions or cultural factors that may affect healthcare-seeking behavior.", "Contradict fact": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim contradicts any established facts or data.", "Understate": "The claim does not understate the disparity in maternal mortality rates between black and white women.
