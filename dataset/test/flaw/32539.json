{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the lowest in-state tuition in Florida, as it is not actually the lowest among all states. It is the sixth-lowest.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or data to support the statement that Florida has the lowest in-state tuition.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the low cost of tuition in Florida is solely due to accountability and will result in better graduation rates, without providing evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider other factors that may contribute to the variation in tuition fees among states, such as state tuition philosophy, aid policy, and economic conditions."}
