{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the severity of the breach of protocol by stating that Donald Trump \"broke royal protocol\" when the expert's verdict suggests it was more of an informal breach and not a definitive violation.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that there is a strict royal protocol that Donald Trump failed to follow, while the expert's verdict indicates that royal etiquette is not as strict as commonly believed.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to conclusively prove that Donald Trump broke royal protocol. The expert's verdict mentions that multiple news reports claimed he did, but it also highlights that the protocol is not clearly defined and that there are no obligatory codes of behavior.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Donald Trump's actions, such as the possibility that he was following the Queen's lead or that there was a miscommunication between them. The expert's verdict suggests that Trump may have been urged by the Queen to walk ahead of her.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the significance of the Queen's actions in urging Trump to walk ahead and the subsequent walking side-by-side. The expert's verdict mentions that Trump spent a total of six seconds in front of the monarch before they resumed walking together, which could be seen as a breach of protocol by some observers."}
