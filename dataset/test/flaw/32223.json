{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the issue of lack of social distancing in the bus by presenting it as a widespread problem when it is based on a single video.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that there is a lack of social distancing in all buses after the limit of 20 people was announced.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the lack of social distancing in the video is solely the responsibility of Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal, without considering other factors or individuals involved.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the lack of social distancing in the video, such as passengers not following the guidelines despite the limit of 20 people being announced."}
