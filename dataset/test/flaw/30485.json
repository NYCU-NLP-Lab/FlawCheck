{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the impact of Scott Walker's proposal to cut income and property taxes by stating that it will \"increase the state deficit at a time when borrowing is already at record levels.\" The expert's verdict clarifies that it would actually increase the state's \"structural deficit,\" which is not the same as an actual budget deficit.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support to substantiate the assertion that Scott Walker's proposal will increase the state deficit. The expert's verdict provides additional context and explanations to understand the complexities of the state's fiscal situation.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that cutting income and property taxes will automatically lead to an increase in the state deficit. The expert's verdict highlights that the relationship between tax cuts and deficits is more nuanced, and it depends on various factors.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Scott Walker's proposal to cut taxes, such as potential economic growth or other budget adjustments. The expert's verdict mentions that the tax cuts were proposed after a projected surplus, indicating that there might be other factors influencing the decision.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times by oversimplifying the relationship between tax cuts and the state deficit. The expert's verdict emphasizes the difference between a structural deficit and an actual deficit, which the claim fails to acknowledge.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the significance of the structural deficit by framing it as a problem of \"increasing the state deficit.\" The expert's verdict highlights that the structural deficit is a projection of future imbalances between revenue and expenditures, which could potentially create a deficit.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the proposed tax cuts would lead to an actual budget deficit. The expert's verdict clarifies that it would increase the structural deficit, but not necessarily the actual deficit."}
