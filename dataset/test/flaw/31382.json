{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or data to back up the statement that 89,000 children were separated from their immigrant parents under President Obama.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the separation of children from their parents at the United States border was solely an issue under President Obama's administration, without considering the context and policy changes implemented by the Trump administration.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the \"zero tolerance\" immigration policy, which led to the widespread separation of children from their parents, was introduced by the Trump administration and not under President Obama.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of children separated from their parents at the United States border under President Obama by stating it as 89,000 without providing any credible evidence to support this figure.", "Understate": "The claim understates the significance and impact of the \"zero tolerance\" policy implemented by the Trump administration by comparing it to a hypothetical scenario under President Obama without acknowledging the differences in policies and enforcement strategies.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation to the claim, which is that the separation of children from their parents at the United States border was a consequence of the \"zero tolerance\" policy introduced by the Trump administration, rather than a policy implemented by President Obama."}
