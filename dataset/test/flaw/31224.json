{"Lack enough support": "The claim that President Obama keeps a dog-trainer on retainer for $102,000 a year lacks sufficient evidence or supporting information.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the cost of a dog trainer for the Obamas is an excessive expense at taxpayer's expense, without providing any context or comparison to previous administrations.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the Obamas have two Portuguese water dogs, Bo and Sunny, and there is no evidence to suggest that they require a full-time dog trainer.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the cost of the dog trainer by stating it as $102,000 a year without providing any evidence or verification for this specific amount.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the actual responsibilities and duties of a dog trainer, assuming that it is a simple and unnecessary expense.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by relying on rumors and unsubstantiated claims about the Obamas' pet-related expenses, such as the false claim that Bo flew on a private jet to Maine.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the presence of a dog trainer, such as the need for assistance with training and caring for the dogs due to the family's busy schedule and high-profile status. However, this is not explored or addressed in the claim."}
