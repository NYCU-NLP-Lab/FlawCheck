{"Lack enough support": "The claim that \"illegal immigrants mow the grass around the Capitol\" lacks sufficient evidence or data to support it. The article mentions that the State Preservation Board contracts with a private company to care for the grounds, and this company is required to use the federal E-Verify system to verify the eligibility of their employees. This information suggests that the workers responsible for mowing the grass are not undocumented immigrants.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all undocumented immigrants are involved in low-skilled manual labor such as mowing lawns. This assumption is problematic as it generalizes the entire population of undocumented immigrants based on a specific job.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The article provides an alternative explanation by stating that a private company, contracted by the State Preservation Board, is responsible for the maintenance of the Capitol grounds. This suggests that the workers involved may not be undocumented immigrants, but rather legally authorized employees.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the information provided in the article, which states that the State Preservation Board requires the contracted company to use the E-Verify system to ensure that employees have the necessary authorization to work legally.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the complexity of the issue by oversimplifying the involvement of undocumented immigrants in certain types of work. It fails to acknowledge the diversity of jobs and industries in which undocumented immigrants may be employed.", "Exaggerate": "There is no clear evidence of exaggeration in the claim, as it simply states that illegal immigrants mow the grass around the Capitol. However, the lack of supporting evidence suggests that the claim may be exaggerated or unsubstantiated.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in terms of providing concrete evidence or sources to support the assertion that illegal immigrants are involved in mowing the grass around the Capitol. It relies on a Facebook comment and does not provide any additional information or data to back up the claim."}
