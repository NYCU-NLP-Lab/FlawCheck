{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the amount of money that would be received by millionaires and billionaires through the extension of current tax rates. The expert's verdict mentions that the average tax increase to millionaires and billionaires would be $128,832, which is higher than the $100,000 mentioned in the claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide any specific sources or evidence to support the statement that extending current tax rates would result in an average of more than $100,000 a year to millionaires and billionaires. However, the expert's verdict mentions data from the Ways and Means Committee and the Joint Committee on Taxation, which provide some support for the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that extending the expiring tax cuts would primarily benefit millionaires and billionaires, without considering the potential impact on other income groups. The expert's verdict mentions that the tax cuts would apply to individuals making less than $200,000 a year and couples making less than $250,000 a year.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the potential impact of extending current tax rates. It focuses solely on the benefit to millionaires and billionaires, without exploring potential economic or fiscal implications."}
