{"Understate": "The claim may understate the achievements or actions of Buhari by stating that he has not built even one nursery school in 2 and a half years in power. This bias suggests that Buhari has not made any progress in this area, which may not be entirely accurate.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific evidence or data to support the statement that Buhari has not built any nursery schools. Without sufficient evidence, the claim may be lacking in credibility.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the construction of nursery schools is the sole measure of progress or achievement in education. This assumption may overlook other initiatives or policies implemented by Buhari's administration that could have had an impact on the education sector.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for why Buhari has not built any nursery schools in the given timeframe. These could include budget constraints, prioritizing other areas of development, or focusing on improving existing educational infrastructure rather than building new schools."}
