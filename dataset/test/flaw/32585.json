{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the gender wage gap by stating that women are paid 80 cents on the dollar of what men are paid for the same work. The expert's verdict clarifies that the 80 percent figure is not an apples-to-apples comparison of men and women performing the same work, but rather an average pay for all jobs held by men and women.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the gender wage gap is solely due to discrimination, without considering other factors such as the degrees and jobs women pursue, time taken off for childcare, number of hours worked, and years of experience. The expert's verdict highlights that the 80 percent figure does not adjust for these factors.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the assertion that women are paid 80 cents on the dollar for the same work. The expert's verdict mentions that the most recent official data from the U.S. Census Bureau shows that women earned 80.5 percent of what men did, but it does not specify if this is for the same work or an average across all jobs.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that the gender wage gap may be influenced by factors other than discrimination, such as the types of jobs and degrees pursued by women, time taken off for childcare, and hours worked. This implies that there may be alternative explanations for the observed wage gap."}
