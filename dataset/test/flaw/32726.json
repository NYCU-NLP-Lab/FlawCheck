{"Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Baucus bill contains provisions that would send massive federal subsidies directly to both private insurance plans and government-chartered cooperatives that pay for elective abortion. This assumption is not fully supported by the evidence provided.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict suggests that there is not enough evidence to fully support the claim. The expert mentions that there are two separate claims related to abortion in the bill, but they end up with different conclusions for each claim.", "Contradict fact": "The expert concludes that the first claim, that federal tax dollars would subsidize abortions, is false. This contradicts the claim made in the statement.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert mentions that the issue at hand is government involvement in plans that offer abortion. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations or interpretations for the provisions in the Baucus bill.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict mentions that there are rulings at opposite ends of the Truth-O-Meter for the claims related to abortion in the bill. This suggests that the claim may falter or be inconsistent in its accuracy.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity of the issue by presenting a simplified statement about federal subsidies and abortion in the Baucus bill.", "Exaggerate": "There is no clear evidence of exaggeration in the claim, as it is based on the expert's analysis of the bill."}
