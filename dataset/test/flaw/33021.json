{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the Democrats' plan by stating that they want to raise taxes on all small businesses, when in reality they are proposing changes to rules on some S-corporations.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that raising taxes on small businesses would directly lead to higher student loan interest rates, without providing enough evidence or explanation for this assumption.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or support to back up the assertion that Democrats plan to raise taxes on small businesses in order to keep student loan interest rates low.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or proposals for keeping student loan interest rates low, such as cutting spending or finding other sources of revenue."}
