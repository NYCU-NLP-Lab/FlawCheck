{"Exaggerate": "The claim that Purdue Pharma has \"been able to act with complete impunity and pay no consequences\" for the opioid crisis exaggerates the extent to which the company has faced accountability for their actions.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Purdue Pharma and three executives pleaded guilty in federal court to charges relating to \"misbranding\" OxyContin and agreed to pay over $634 million in fines and other payments.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to substantiate the assertion that Purdue Pharma has faced no consequences for their actions. The expert's verdict provides evidence of legal actions and settlements against the company.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why Purdue Pharma may not have faced more severe consequences, such as the complexities of the legal system or limitations in prosecuting pharmaceutical companies."}
