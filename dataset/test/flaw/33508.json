The evidence provided shows a mix of positions and actions taken by Biden regarding Social Security.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that advocating for freezes or changes to Social Security at certain points in time equates to advocating for cuts. This assumption may not be accurate as Biden's positions have evolved and varied over the years.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There are alternative explanations for Biden's positions on Social Security, such as his efforts to reduce the deficit or negotiate on stabilizing the program.
