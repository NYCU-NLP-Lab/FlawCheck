{"Exaggeration": "The claim suggests that Hungarian police use pigs to deter Muslims from crossing the border. However, the evidence provided indicates that the image used in the claim has been doctored and does not accurately represent the actions of the Hungarian police.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or credible sources to support the assertion that Hungarian police use pigs to deter Muslims from crossing the border.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the image used has been doctored and is not a true representation of the actions of the Hungarian police.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the presence of pigs would deter Muslims from crossing the border, which may be a problematic assumption as it generalizes the behavior and motivations of a specific religious group.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for the image used in the claim, stating that it is a doctored version of a photo taken in the Philippines during a typhoon, not related to Hungarian police or the crossing of borders."}
