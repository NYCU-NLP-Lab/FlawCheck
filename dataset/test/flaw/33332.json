{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of crimes committed by criminal aliens in Texas by stating that there were \"566,000 crimes made in Texas by criminal aliens in the last 6 years.\" The actual number of crimes committed by individuals living illegally in the United States is much lower, according to research rooted in U.S. Census Bureau data.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is limited data available about Texas crimes committed by individuals living illegally in the United States. The expert mentions that they found scant data on this topic.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all crimes in Texas were committed by criminal aliens, which is a problematic assumption. The expert points out that unauthorized immigrants commit few crimes nationally based on research.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the crimes mentioned in the claim. The expert mentions that the 170,000 arrests of \"criminal immigrants\" proclaimed by a Texas House member represented about 4 percent of all adult arrests in the state from 2011 through 2015. This suggests that there are other factors contributing to crime in Texas.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that unauthorized immigrants commit few crimes nationally, as mentioned by the expert based on research rooted in U.S. Census Bureau data.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement in the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times as it presents contradictory interpretations. While the claim initially suggests that \"criminal aliens\" were found guilty of 566,000 crimes over six years, there is smaller text to the right that offers a different interpretation, stating that \"criminal aliens have been charged with more than 566,000 crimes in Texas.\" This inconsistency raises questions about the accuracy of the claim."}
