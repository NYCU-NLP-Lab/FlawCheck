{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the amount of money being spent on infrastructure and non-military projects in Afghanistan by stating it as $100 billion, while the actual amount mentioned in the sources is significantly lower.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence provided to back up the statement that the same things are being cut in the United States.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the money spent in Afghanistan could be redirected towards improving America's own infrastructure without considering other factors or priorities.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the allocation of funds in Afghanistan, such as strengthening Afghan security forces and counteracting the drug trade, which are not mentioned in the claim."}
