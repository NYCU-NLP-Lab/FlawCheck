This contradicts the claim's assertion of the use of live rounds and lethal force.", "Lack enough support": "The claim is based on social media posts circulating online, which suggest that Austin Police officers were using live rounds and lethal force against protesters. However, the expert's verdict provides evidence from the Police Chief's statement and department guidelines, which indicate that less-lethal ammunition was used, and deadly force was not authorized.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the authorization of live rounds and lethal force against protesters is a factual and accurate representation of the situation. However, the expert's verdict provides evidence that contradicts this assumption, indicating that the claim is not supported by the facts.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim suggests that police officers have been authorized to use live rounds and lethal force against protesters. However, the expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by stating that officers used less-lethal bean bag rounds and other non-lethal tactics for crowd management. This alternative explanation challenges the claim's assertion of the use of lethal force."}
