{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the increase in size of the five largest financial institutions by stating that they are \"38 percent bigger\" than in 2008. The actual increase, according to the analysis, is about 25 percent.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific data or sources to back up the statement. The analysis mentioned is from 2013 and may not accurately reflect the current situation.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in size of the financial institutions is a problem and implies that it makes them \"too big to fail.\" However, the size alone does not necessarily determine the risk of failure.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the increase in size of the financial institutions, such as mergers and acquisitions or changes in the industry landscape."}
