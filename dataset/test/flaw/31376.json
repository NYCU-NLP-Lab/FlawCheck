{"Lack enough support": "The claim that every 85 visitors create one Florida job is based on calculations and estimates, rather than concrete data or research.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes a direct and causal relationship between the number of visitors and job creation, without considering other factors that may contribute to job growth or the overall economic impact of tourism.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for job creation in the leisure and hospitality industry, such as local spending, government initiatives, or other economic factors, that are not accounted for in the claim."}
