{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the actions of Tukaram Omble by stating that he was shot 23 times and still managed to capture terrorist Kasab alive. This may not be an accurate representation of the events.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that the photograph in question is indeed of Tukaram Omble.

This assumption may be problematic if it is not based on verified information.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that the photograph in question is a movie still and not an actual photograph of Tukaram Omble. This alternative explanation challenges the claim's assertion and raises doubts about its accuracy.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the image on the left is a movie still, not a photograph of Tukaram Omble. This contradiction undermines the claim's credibility and accuracy.", "Understate": "There is no clear evidence of understating bias in the provided claim."}
