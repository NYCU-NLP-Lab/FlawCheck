{"Exaggerate": "The claim of illegal counterfeiting and piracy costing the U.S. economy $100 billion every year may be an exaggeration. The expert's verdict mentions that estimates of the impact of online counterfeiting and piracy are hard to determine and corral, indicating that the $100 billion figure may not be entirely accurate.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that the $100 billion figure originates from a report commissioned by the Business Action to Stop Counterfeiting and Piracy. However, it does not provide further details or evidence to support the accuracy of this figure.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all counterfeiting and piracy are illegal and that they directly result in a $100 billion cost to the U.S. economy. However, the expert's verdict mentions that it is difficult to estimate the impact of online counterfeiting and piracy, suggesting that the assumption of a direct and specific cost may be problematic.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim made by U.S. Rep. Lamar Smith is in support of the Stop Online Piracy Act. This suggests that there may be an alternative explanation for the claim, as it could be influenced by political motivations or the desire to pass legislation rather than solely providing an accurate representation of the economic impact of counterfeiting and piracy.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict mentions weaknesses in the claim, indicating that it may falter at times in providing a strong and well-supported argument for the $100 billion cost.", "Understate": "There is no evidence or indication in the expert's verdict that the claim of illegal counterfeiting and piracy costing the U.S. economy $100 billion every year is an understatement.", "Contradict fact": "There is no evidence or indication in the expert's verdict that the claim of illegal counterfeiting and piracy costing the U.S. economy $100 billion every year contradicts any established facts."}
