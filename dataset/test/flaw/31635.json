{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the improvement in Texas high school graduation rates by stating that they are at an \"all-time high\" and the \"third-highest in the nation.\" This may be an overstatement of the actual improvement that has occurred.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that Texas high school graduation rates have significantly improved. It only mentions the statements made by Gov. Rick Perry and the Texas Education Agency without providing additional data or sources.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in graduation rates is solely due to the efforts of state leaders and the improvement of Texas public schools. It does not consider other potential factors that may have contributed to the increase.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the improvement in graduation rates, such as changes in graduation requirements, standardized testing policies, or demographic shifts in the student population."}
