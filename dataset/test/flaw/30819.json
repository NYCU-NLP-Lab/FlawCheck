{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that the opponent has no child care plan, when in fact they do have policies related to child care.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it fails to provide evidence or specific examples to back up the assertion that the opponent has no child care plan.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that if child care policies are not explicitly mentioned on the opponent's website, then they do not have a child care plan.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation that the opponent's child care plan may be included under headings such as \"paid family and medical leave\" and \"early childhood education\" on their website, which the claim fails to acknowledge."}
