{"Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict states that there is no statewide data or evidence to support the claim that more ex-felons have registered as Republicans than Democrats in Florida. Therefore, the claim lacks enough support.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in voter registration among ex-felons in Florida automatically translates to a higher number of ex-felons registering as Republicans than Democrats. This assumption is problematic as it is not backed by any evidence or data.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict contradicts the claim made by Jared Kushner, stating that there is no data to support the claim that more ex-felons have registered as Republicans in Florida.", "Understate": "It is possible that the claim may be understating the number of ex-felons who have registered as Republicans in Florida, as there is no conclusive data available to confirm or refute the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing accurate information by stating that more ex-felons have registered as Republicans than Democrats without any evidence to support this assertion.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the claim, such as a misinterpretation of data from an NBC report or a misunderstanding of the registration process for ex-felons in Florida."}
