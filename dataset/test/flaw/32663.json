{"Lack enough support": "The claim that the Legislative Ethics Commission continues to function lacks enough support because there is no evidence provided to show how it is functioning without an inspector general to investigate complaints.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Legislative Ethics Commission can continue to function effectively without an inspector general, which may be a problematic assumption as the primary purpose of an ethics commission is to investigate and mete out discipline for ethics violations.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there has been no legislative inspector general since 2014, which raises doubts about the commission's ability to function properly.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not provide an alternative explanation for how the commission can function without an inspector general, which leaves room for alternative explanations or possibilities.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times because it does not address the specific concerns raised by Denise Rotheimer about her case languishing until she went public with her allegations.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the functioning of the Legislative Ethics Commission by stating that it continues to function without an inspector general, without providing sufficient evidence or explanation.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the significance of not having an inspector general for almost three years, as it dismisses it as not being a cause for alarm."}
