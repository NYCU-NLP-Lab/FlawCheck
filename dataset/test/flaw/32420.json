{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only provides a list of petrol prices in BJP-governed states without considering all the states governed by the BJP or its alliances.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that petrol prices in BJP-governed states are consistently lower than \u20b990, which is not supported by the data provided.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There are alternative explanations for the difference in petrol prices between BJP-governed and non-BJP-governed states, such as regional factors and alliances with other parties.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the petrol prices in some BJP-governed states by selectively quoting lower prices and omitting states where prices are over \u20b990.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there are BJP-governed states, like Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh, where petrol prices are over \u20b990.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the difference in petrol prices between BJP-governed and non-BJP-governed states by selectively presenting data without considering all relevant factors."}
