{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating Trump's criticism of Obama by stating that he accused him of \"subverting the Constitution of the U.S.\" It is possible that Trump's criticism was not as extreme or direct.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide any specific evidence or examples to support the statement that Trump criticized Obama for being unable to negotiate with Congress. More information or sources would be needed to assess the validity of this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Trump's criticism of Obama in 2014 is directly relevant to his own actions in 2020. It may be a problematic assumption to equate the two situations without further context or analysis.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Trump's criticism of Obama. There could be other reasons or motivations behind Trump's criticism that are not mentioned or explored in the provided information."}
