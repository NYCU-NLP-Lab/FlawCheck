{"Understate": "The claim may understate the extent of non-revenue water in the Nairobi system by stating that \"nearly half\" of the water is non-revenue. It is possible that the actual percentage is higher.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific evidence or data to support the assertion that nearly half of the water distributed through the Nairobi system is non-revenue water. Without sufficient supporting information, the claim lacks enough support.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the water sold in informal settlements is the most expensive water in Nairobi County. This assumption may not be accurate or supported by evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the presence of non-revenue water in the Nairobi system. It is possible that factors other than distribution contribute to the high percentage of non-revenue water.", "Exaggerate": "While it is not explicitly stated in the claim, there is a possibility that the extent of non-revenue water in the Nairobi system is exaggerated. Without concrete evidence, the claim may overstate the problem."}
