{"Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in homelessness in Colorado is directly caused by the legalization of cannabis, without considering other factors that may have contributed to it.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to conclusively prove that the increase in homelessness in Colorado is solely due to the legalization of cannabis.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim acknowledges that there is significant doubt over whether the legalization of cannabis caused or contributed to the increase in homelessness, suggesting that there may be other factors at play.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential impact of the legalization of cannabis on homelessness by focusing on specific time periods or statistics that support their argument, while neglecting other relevant data.", "Falters at times": "The claim presents conflicting information about the increase in homelessness, stating both that it fell by six percent each year between 2012 and 2017 and that there was an average annual increase of 2.94 percent between January 2013 and January 2017.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Colorado's average annual rate of decline in homelessness during the six years after the legalization of cannabis was the 17th-highest in the country, suggesting that the increase in homelessness may not be solely attributed to cannabis legalization.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the impact of cannabis legalization on homelessness by highlighting specific statistics that show an increase, while ignoring the overall decline in homelessness in Colorado during the same period."}
