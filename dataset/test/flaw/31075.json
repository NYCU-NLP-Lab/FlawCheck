This exaggeration misrepresents Lemonis' actual statement.", "Lack enough support": "The Gateway Pundit article and the Daily Wire report lacked enough support for their claim that Lemonis directed his comments at all Trump supporters.

He specifically referred to those who agreed with Trump's response to the Charlottesville protests.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understating biases in the provided claim.", "Falters at times": "There is no evidence of the claim faltering at times in terms of biases.", "Other biases not listed": "There may be other biases present in the claim that are not explicitly mentioned in the expert's verdict."}
