{"Exaggerate": "The claim implies that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is transporting children in freight train cars, which could be seen as an exaggeration since there is no evidence or support provided for this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The post does not provide any specific details or evidence about the alleged use of freight trains to transport children. There is no information about who witnessed the incident, where it occurred, or any other identifying information.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption by alluding to the Holocaust and comparing the use of freight train cars by ICE to transport children to the transportation of Jewish detainees to concentration camps in Nazi Germany. This assumption lacks evidence and context.", "Exist alternative explanation": "ICE's public affairs office denies the claim and states that there is no basis of truth in the rumor. They explain that ICE uses planes and road vehicles for transferring individuals within the U.S. This alternative explanation suggests that the claim may not be accurate."}
