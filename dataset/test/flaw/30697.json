{"Exaggerate": "The claim states that the income tax started at 2 percent and is now 9 percent, which is an exaggeration because the highest income tax rate in New Jersey is 8.97 percent.", "Understate": "The claim fails to mention that the highest income tax rate of 8.97 percent only applies to income in excess of $500,000, which is a small percentage of filers in New Jersey. This understates the impact of the income tax for the majority of taxpayers.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that the income tax has increased from 2 percent to 9 percent.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in income tax is solely due to the influence of liberal politicians, without considering other factors or economic changes that may have contributed to the tax rate changes.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not explore alternative explanations for the increase in income tax rates, such as changes in economic conditions, budgetary needs, or legislative decisions."}
