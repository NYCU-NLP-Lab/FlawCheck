{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the amount of items that Hillary Clinton allegedly stole from the White House. The expert's verdict states that she was forced to return an estimated $200,000 worth of items, but it is later clarified that the government only received back $134,000 and some items were returned to the Clintons.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that Hillary Clinton stole the items. The expert's verdict provides evidence that some gifts were intended for the government and others for the person living in the White House, making it difficult to determine ownership.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Hillary Clinton stole the items, without providing sufficient evidence or proof. The expert's verdict highlights the complexities of determining ownership and the lack of criminal wrongdoing found by the House Committee on Government Reform.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the situation, such as misunderstandings regarding donations intended for the White House remodeling project."}
