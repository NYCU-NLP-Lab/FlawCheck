{"Lack enough support": "The claim of an infant born with three eyes lacks enough support as the provided evidence suggests that the viral video is edited and not a real occurrence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The alternative explanation for the claim is that the video is a result of video editing, as mentioned by the expert.
