{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks evidence or sources to support the assertion that ICE has not deported or detained any white illegal immigrants.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the absence of white illegal immigrant deportations or detentions by ICE is solely based on race, without considering other factors such as legal status or country of origin.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The existence of white immigrants who have been deported or detained by ICE is highlighted through examples of individuals from Ireland who were deported or detained.", "Understate": "The claim understates the number of white illegal immigrants by stating that there are 600,000 of them, while Pew Research Center estimates that there were about 700,000 white unauthorized individuals in 2017.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there have been instances of white illegal immigrants being deported or detained by ICE, as evidenced by the examples provided in the expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by making a sweeping statement that ICE has not deported or detained any white illegal immigrants, without considering the possibility of isolated cases or individual circumstances.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the situation by presenting a broad generalization that no white illegal immigrants have been deported or detained by ICE, without providing sufficient evidence to support this claim."}
