{"Exaggerate": "The claim of being at a \"40-year low\" in crime rates may be an exaggeration, as the expert questions the dramatic statement and investigates the actual data.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as the expert had to dig deeper and investigate the crime statistics to determine its accuracy.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the low crime rate is a direct result of the actions taken by Governor Rick Scott, without considering other potential factors.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's investigation raises the possibility of alternative explanations for the low crime rate, such as changes in population or shifts in law enforcement strategies.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times as it is repeatedly used by Governor Rick Scott without providing further evidence or context.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the crime rate has fluctuated over the years, rather than consistently being at a 40-year low.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understating bias in the claim."}
