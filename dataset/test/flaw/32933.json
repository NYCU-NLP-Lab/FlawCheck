{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the amount of remittances received by Mexico from Mexican nationals working in the United States. The expert's verdict states that the claim of \"approximately $24 billion a year\" is supported by data from the Bank of Mexico, but it does not provide any further evidence or analysis to confirm or refute this figure.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that there is no estimate from any organization or researcher regarding the share of remittance senders who are unauthorized immigrants. This lack of specific data undermines the claim's assertion that the majority of remittances come from illegal aliens.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that by barring undocumented immigrants from sending wire transfers, Mexico would be motivated to pay for the wall. This assumption is not supported by any evidence or logical reasoning.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that legal migrants, who are often settled with their families in the United States, are less likely to remit money compared to undocumented immigrants. This alternative explanation challenges the claim's assertion that the majority of remittances come from illegal aliens.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not providing enough evidence or analysis to support its assertion about the majority of remittances coming from illegal aliens. The expert's verdict highlights the lack of specific data on the share of remittance senders who are unauthorized immigrants.", "Contradict fact": "No specific contradiction of facts is evident in the claim or the expert's verdict."}
