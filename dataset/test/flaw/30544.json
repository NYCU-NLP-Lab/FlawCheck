{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the pay gap between Texas women and men by stating that women make an average of $8,355 less per year doing the very same job. This may not account for variations in hours worked and lengths of tenure, which can impact pay differences.", "Lack enough support": "The claim relies on a report from the National Partnership for Women & Families, but it does not provide additional evidence or data to support the specific claim that women in Texas make $8,355 less per year doing the same job as men.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the pay gap is solely due to gender discrimination without considering other factors that could contribute to the difference in earnings, such as job choices, education, experience, or negotiation skills.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the pay gap, such as differences in job roles, industries, or career paths chosen by men and women, which can influence earnings.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there have been other claims about the gender pay gap that have been rated as \"Mostly False\" by PolitiFact, indicating that the claim may not be entirely accurate.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times by not providing a comprehensive analysis of the factors contributing to the pay gap and by relying on a single report without considering other sources or perspectives.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the pay gap between Texas women and men by only focusing on the average difference of $8,355 per year. It does not provide information about the percentage difference in earnings or the potential long-term impact of the pay gap."}
