{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that gains on a national standardized test lend credence to \"dramatic\" score increases on state tests. The expert's verdict mentions that there is no supporting evidence provided by the superintendent or the Council of Great City Schools Executive Director.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that improvements on the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) can be directly linked to improvements on state tests without considering other factors that may contribute to the differences in scores.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the improvements in Atlanta Public Schools scores on the state tests, such as the possibility of cheating or invalidity of the results.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential limitations of using the NAEP as a measure of student achievement, as it is mentioned that not all students take the test and they don't receive their individual results.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the validity of the state test scores has been questioned by state investigators, the Governor\u2019s Office for Student Achievement, and The Atlanta Journal-Constitution."}
