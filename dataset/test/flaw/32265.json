{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or supporting information to prove that farmers were stone-pelting at BJP MLA Uday Singh in Haryana.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video of the stone-pelting incident shows protesting farmers attacking the BJP MLA, without providing any concrete proof or context.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The video and accompanying claims could be misleading or misinterpreted, as it is revealed that the incident actually took place during a clash between two factions during polling in Rajasthan, unrelated to the farmers' protest."}
