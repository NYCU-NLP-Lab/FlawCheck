{"Exaggerate": "The claim of malaria killing one child every 30 seconds in Africa is an exaggeration based on the available data.", "Lack enough support": "The claim is not supported by the most recent data from reputable sources like the World Health Organisation (WHO).", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the outdated statistic from 2003 is still accurate, which is a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The WHO provides a breakdown of malaria deaths for children under the age of five, which shows that the claim is not accurate."}
