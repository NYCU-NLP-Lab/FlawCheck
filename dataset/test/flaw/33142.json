{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the potential impact by suggesting that all 100,000 Michiganders who have survived COVID-19 would be at risk of losing insurance coverage if the ACA is repealed or overturned. The expert's verdict clarifies that not all of them have insurance through the individual market and that those who are covered by job-based programs, Medicaid, or Medicare would not be at risk.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient supporting evidence to demonstrate that Eric Esshaki's opposition to the Affordable Care Act would directly lead to insurance companies kicking people with preexisting conditions off their plans in the middle of a pandemic. The expert's verdict mentions that Esshaki supports fully repealing the ACA, but it does not provide specific evidence or examples of how this would result in such actions.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Eric Esshaki's support for repealing the ACA automatically means he supports allowing insurance companies to kick people with preexisting conditions off their plans. However, the expert's verdict mentions that Esshaki has promised to find a replacement that protects people with preexisting conditions, as Republicans have pledged for over a decade. This suggests that the assumption made in the claim may be problematic.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider or acknowledge alternative explanations for Eric Esshaki's stance on the Affordable Care Act. The expert's verdict mentions that Esshaki, like many Republicans, supports repealing the ACA but does not provide further insight into his specific reasons or alternative healthcare proposals he may have."}
