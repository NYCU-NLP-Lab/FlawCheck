{"Understate": "The expert's verdict suggests that the image's claim of contrasting changes in the financial status of former and current U.S. presidents is an understatement. The expert explains that the image reveals nothing remarkable or surprising because it compares two former presidents who have had more time to establish connections and build experience with one current president who has only been in office for a year.", "Lack enough support": "The expert mentions that net worth figures are typically estimates and that candidates are only required to list their assets and liabilities in ranges. This lack of precise data could suggest that the claim lacks enough support to make a definitive comparison.", "Problematic assumption": "The expert points out that the image assumes that the financial status of former and current U.S. presidents is solely determined by their time in office. This assumption overlooks other factors that could contribute to differences in their financial status.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert suggests an alternative explanation for the differences in the financial status of former and current U.S. presidents. They explain that former presidents can avail themselves of money-making opportunities common to ex-presidents, such as writing books, giving speeches, consulting for private companies, and holding board seats. This alternative explanation challenges the claim that the differences in financial status are solely due to their time in office."}
