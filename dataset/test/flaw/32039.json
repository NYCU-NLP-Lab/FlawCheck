{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the cost that Florida taxpayers pay to feed and house criminal illegal aliens in the prison system.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to accurately determine the cost incurred by Florida taxpayers for criminal illegal aliens in the prison system.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all \"aliens\" in the Florida prison system are criminal illegal aliens, which is not accurate as the term \"aliens\" includes both legal and illegal non-U.S. citizens.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation that the majority of alien inmates are released to ICE for further immigration processing, including possible deportation, suggesting that the claim may not accurately reflect the situation."}
