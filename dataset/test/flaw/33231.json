{"Exaggerate": "The claim of non-defense discretionary spending increasing \"by over 80 percent in the last two years\" is an exaggeration. The increase is actually 83.4 percent when including the stimulus money, but this is not clearly stated in the claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific data or sources to back up the statement.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in non-defense discretionary spending is solely due to the actions of President Barack Obama, without considering other factors or parties involved.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the increase in non-defense discretionary spending, such as economic factors or changes in legislation, which are not explored in the claim."}
