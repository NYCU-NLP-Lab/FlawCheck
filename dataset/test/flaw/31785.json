{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the number of police officers assaulted in New York state by stating that \"just last year, alone, 710 police officers\" were assaulted. The expert's verdict mentions that the FBI data only includes assaults on law enforcement officers outside New York City, and the New York City Police Department reports a broader range of assaults on various personnel, not solely law enforcement officers. Therefore, the claim may be exaggerating the number of assaults on police officers by not considering the data from New York City.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any specific evidence or sources to back up the claim that 710 police officers were assaulted in New York state. The expert's verdict mentions the FBI data, but also highlights the limitations of that data, which does not include assaults on officers from New York City. Therefore, the claim lacks enough support to be considered reliable.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the assumption that the number of assaults on police officers in New York state should convince others to support the proposed legislation. This assumption may be problematic as it does not consider alternative explanations or factors that could contribute to the number of assaults, such as changes in reporting methods or other societal factors.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the number of assaults on police officers in New York state. The expert's verdict mentions that the FBI data does not include assaults on officers from New York City, and the New York City Police Department reports a broader range of assaults. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations or factors contributing to the number of assaults that are not considered in the claim."}
