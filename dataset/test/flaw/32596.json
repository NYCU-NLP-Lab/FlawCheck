It jumps to a conclusion without considering alternative explanations.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict presents an alternative explanation for the flooding, stating that it was caused by a water main rupture in a facility room.

This highlights a contradiction between the claim and the verified information.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the situation by stating that the Hudson River flooded the Lincoln Tunnel, which implies a significant and catastrophic event.

It fails to acknowledge the water main rupture as the actual reason for the incident."}
