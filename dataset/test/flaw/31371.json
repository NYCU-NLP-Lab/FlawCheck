{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts official ICE figures for 2017 and 2018, which show human trafficking arrests declining from the last year of Obama's presidency.", "Lack enough support": "The data for years 2017-2018 is based on bogus numbers gathered by followers of the QAnon conspiracy theory, which lacks credibility and support.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the rise in arrests during the Trump years is solely due to the president's leadership, without considering other factors.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the increase in human trafficking arrests, such as changes in law enforcement strategies or reporting methods."}
