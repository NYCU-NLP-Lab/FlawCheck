{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent of the EPA regulation by stating that it specifically regulates dust, when in fact it regulates particulate matter, which includes dust.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the EPA has a regulation going into effect on January 1, 2012, to regulate dust.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the regulation of dust by the EPA is an example of the agency going too far, without providing evidence or justification for this assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there is no new regulation scheduled for January 1, 2012, specifically targeting dust.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the regulation of particulate matter by the EPA, such as the potential health risks associated with particle pollution."}
