{"Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity of the situation by stating that all Missouri businesses can open on May 4, when in reality, there were extended stay-at-home orders in some counties and cities.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or data to back up the statement that all businesses can open on May 4.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation to the claim as counties and cities had the authority to impose more restrictive measures, contradicting the claim that all businesses can open as long as guidelines are followed.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that not all businesses were able to open on May 4 due to extended restrictions in some localities.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all businesses in Missouri can open on May 4, but it fails to consider the varying regulations and restrictions imposed by different counties and cities."}
