{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent to which American liberals are debating the merits of \"after birth abortion.\" The expert's verdict clarifies that the authors of the original paper were not American liberals, and their ideas were not widely supported or advocated for.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it relies on unreliable sources and does not provide sufficient evidence to back up the assertion that American liberals are debating \"after birth abortion.\"", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the views of two ethicists from Australia represent the stance of American liberals as a whole. However, the expert's verdict highlights that this is a problematic assumption, as the authors themselves clarified that they did not intend to suggest that after-birth abortion should become legal.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the authors' views, such as the fact that they were philosophers dealing with concepts rather than policy makers. The expert's verdict provides this alternative explanation."}
