{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Iranians watched the war between Azerbaijan and Armenia from a mountain top. The provided evidence consists of a video showing people watching shots being fired, but it does not conclusively prove that they are Iranians or that they were watching the war.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the people shown in the video are Iranians and that they were specifically watching the war between Azerbaijan and Armenia. This assumption is not substantiated and may be misleading.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the activity shown in the video. It is possible that the people were simply observing military exercises or other unrelated events, rather than actively watching a war.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the video in question was circulating on social media in November 2019, indicating that it is not recent and therefore cannot be evidence of Iranians watching the ongoing war between Azerbaijan and Armenia.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance of the video by presenting it as evidence of Iranians actively watching the war. Without more context and evidence, it is difficult to determine the true nature and intent of the people shown in the video.", "Understate": "There is no clear evidence of understatement bias in the provided claim."}
