{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of the law by stating that it fines people for using solar power, while the law actually allows utility companies to apply for a tariff or fee for customers who generate their own energy using solar or wind power.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the law is specifically targeting solar power users and is designed to impede the expansion of solar usage among Oklahoma consumers, without providing enough evidence to support this assumption.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the statement that the law fines people for using solar power, as the law actually allows for a potential fee or tariff, which would require extensive court-like hearings before being implemented.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the law does not mandate an increase for solar customers, as stated by Bryan Miller, president of the pro-solar group Alliance for Solar Choice.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation provided by experts, stating that the law is not specifically targeting solar power users and that the governor's executive order does not change the fact that the law is designed to impede the expansion of solar usage among Oklahoma consumers."}
