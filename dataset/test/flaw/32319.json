{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Missouri has the worst roads in the Midwest and nearly the worst roads in the country. While Missouri does have poor road conditions, it may not necessarily be the absolute worst in the Midwest or the country.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support to prove that Missouri has the worst roads in the Midwest. It only provides information about the percentage of rural roads in poor condition in Missouri compared to other states.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the condition of rural roads is representative of overall road quality in Missouri, which may not be accurate.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for poor road conditions, such as weather conditions, traffic volume, or budget constraints."}
