{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating Trump's statement by implying that he said all prisoners of war are not heroes, rather than specifically referring to John McCain.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide direct evidence or quotes from Trump to support the statement that he said prisoners of war like John McCain aren't heroes.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Trump's statement about McCain can be generalized to all prisoners of war, which may not be accurate.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation that Trump's comment about McCain not being a hero was made in the context of a heated exchange between the two politicians and may not reflect his overall view on prisoners of war."}
