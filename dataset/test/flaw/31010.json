{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the actions of the officials by stating that they were \"gleefully\" dancing without obeying health protocols, while citizens were living in fear and following strict guidelines.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the officials were not following health protocols. The video itself does not show whether they were wearing masks or practicing social distancing.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video was taken during the Covid-19 pandemic, without providing any evidence to support this assumption. The video was actually recorded on January 31, 2020, before Indonesia announced its first Covid-19 cases.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The video is explained as a performance during a coordination meeting of the East Java provincial government, where officials were singing and dancing. This alternative explanation suggests that the officials' actions were not related to disregarding health protocols during the pandemic."}
