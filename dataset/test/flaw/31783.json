{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that the photograph shows Pelosi and Waters posing beneath a Trump 2020 campaign sign, when in fact the image was manipulated and the sign was digitally added.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or sources to back up the assertion that the photograph shows Pelosi and Waters posing beneath a Trump 2020 campaign sign.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Pelosi and Waters are unlikely to support Trump's 2020 reelection bid, as they have been long-time Democrats and have not shown any public support for Trump.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that the manipulated image accurately represents a real event, without providing any evidence or context to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not provide any alternative explanation for the manipulated image or consider any other possible interpretations of the photograph."}
