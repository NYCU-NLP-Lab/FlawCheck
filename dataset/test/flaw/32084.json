{"Lack enough support": "The claim that every year there is a slightly smaller percentage of American households owning guns lacks enough support as the evidence provided shows that the percentage has been fairly static since 2000, with fluctuations up and down.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the National Rifle Association (NRA) opposes background checks because they are aware of the declining percentage of American households owning guns. This assumption may be problematic as there could be other reasons for their opposition.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the NRA's opposition to background checks, such as concerns about individual rights or potential infringements on the Second Amendment.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the percentage of households possessing firearms has not consistently decreased every year since 2000, as shown by the General Social Survey data.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the percentage of households owning guns by not considering alternative surveys like Gallup, which have different percentages and trends.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the decline in gun ownership by stating that it happens every year, while the evidence suggests a more fluctuating trend.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not acknowledging the differing results and trends from alternative surveys like Gallup, which show a more stable or fluctuating gun ownership percentage."}
