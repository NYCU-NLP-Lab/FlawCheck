{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that the 2017 GOP tax overhaul plan includes language that attempts to codify \"fetal personhood.\" The expert's verdict mentions that the language regarding unborn children as beneficiaries in 529 plans was present in the bills but later repealed, making it uncertain whether it was an intentional attempt to establish fetal personhood.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the inclusion of unborn children as beneficiaries in 529 plans is equivalent to attempting to codify \"fetal personhood.\" However, this assumption may be problematic as it is not explicitly stated in the expert's verdict that the intention behind this provision was to establish fetal personhood.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for including unborn children as beneficiaries in 529 plans, such as providing earlier college savings for families. The pro-life Susan B. Anthony List expressed their support for this measure based on this alternative explanation, suggesting that it may not solely be about establishing fetal personhood.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not providing a clear connection between the provision in the GOP tax plan and the concept of fetal personhood. It is not clearly explained how the inclusion of unborn children as beneficiaries in 529 plans relates to the legal theory that a fetus has the same rights as a person.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the language attempting to codify \"fetal personhood\" was repealed in the Senate's final version of the tax plan. This contradicts the claim that the 2017 GOP tax overhaul plan includes such language.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the significance of the provision regarding unborn children as beneficiaries in 529 plans. While it may not directly establish fetal personhood, it could potentially have implications or be seen as a step towards that direction. However, this is not explicitly mentioned in the expert's verdict."}
