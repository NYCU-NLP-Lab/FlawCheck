{"Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the man in women's clothing is attending the protests in Shaheenbagh for personal gain, specifically mentioning biryani and Rs 500.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or proof to support the assertion that the man is dressing in women's clothing to join the protests.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the photo has been circulating online since at least 2015 and is actually from a media report about a burqa-clad militant arrested in Kashmir.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of the man dressing in women's clothing by implying it is related to the CAA and NRC protests in Shaheenbagh.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for why the man is dressed in women's clothing, such as cultural or personal reasons, that are not mentioned in the claim.", "Understate": "The claim potentially understates the complexity and context of the protests in Shaheenbagh by focusing on a singular incident without considering the broader issues and motivations behind the protests.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in its attempt to link the man dressing in women's clothing to the protests as it is based on a misleading photo and lacks credible evidence."}
