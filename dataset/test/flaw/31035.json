{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the amount of debt a child born in America today will inherit. The actual debt per citizen is currently around $55,000, much lower than the claimed $1.5 million.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it is based on projections and assumptions about future debt levels and population estimates.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the U.S. debt projection and population will remain constant for the next 80 years, which may not be accurate.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the debt levels in the future, such as changes in government policies or economic conditions."}
