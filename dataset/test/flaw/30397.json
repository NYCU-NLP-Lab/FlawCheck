{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the issue of counterfeit salon products being sold by T.J. Maxx and Marshall's, as it presents only a few instances of labeling discrepancies as evidence for a widespread problem.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that T.J. Maxx and Marshall's sell counterfeit salon products. The provided evidence consists of photographs and messages circulated on social media, which may not be reliable sources.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that salon-brand hair products should only be bought at hair salons, not discount retailers. This assumption may not be universally agreed upon and can be subjective.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the labeling discrepancies, such as manufacturing fluctuations or the need to reduce waste, as stated by T.J. Maxx and CHI."}
