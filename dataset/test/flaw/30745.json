{"Understate": "The claim understates the number of calls received by the NC elections board by stating that they received \"no calls\" after alerting Bladen County voters to possible absentee ballot fraud.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or data to support the statement that no calls were received by the elections board.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the absence of calls to the hotline number provided by the elections board indicates that no fraudulent activity took place, which is a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the lack of calls, such as voters not being aware of the hotline number or not feeling comfortable reporting potential fraud."}
