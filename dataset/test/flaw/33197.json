{"Exaggerate": "The claim made by Vice President Mike Pence that \"well over half\" of the people at the Women's March on Washington supported President Donald Trump is an exaggeration. This claim was made by a fake Facebook profile and there is no evidence or support to back it up.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence or confirmation from the organizers of the march regarding encounters with Trump supporters during the event.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that there was significant support for President Trump among the participants of the Women's March on Washington, without providing any substantial evidence or data to support this assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that none of the four reporters from the New York Daily News, who covered the local version of the march, saw any evidence of significant support for President Trump.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times as it is based on a fake Facebook profile and was mistakenly picked up as real news before being taken down. This indicates a lack of credibility and reliability.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation for the claim is that it was deliberately fabricated or spread as misinformation to undermine the Women's March on Washington or to create a false narrative about support for President Trump."}
