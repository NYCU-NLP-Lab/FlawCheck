{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the proposed authority granted to federal judges by stating that it allows defendants to be detained indefinitely until the emergency is deemed over. The expert's verdict clarifies that the proposed powers would not be conferred upon the executive branch and would expire with the end of the national emergency.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific evidence or sources to support its statement about the U.S. Department of Justice's proposal. The expert's verdict, however, provides information from Politico, a national politics news website, which reported on the DOJ's drafted legislative proposals.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the proposed authority granted to federal judges during a national emergency is solely under the Trump administration. The expert's verdict mentions that the DOJ, which consists of federal litigators, is part of the executive branch under President Donald Trump, but it does not specify that the proposal is exclusive to his administration.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or perspectives regarding the proposed authority granted to federal judges during a national emergency. The expert's verdict provides additional context and clarifications, but it does not explicitly mention alternative explanations."}
