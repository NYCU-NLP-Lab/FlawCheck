{"Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific evidence or data to support the statement that Ohio companies export more goods and services globally than 41 other states. It only mentions the ranking provided by the Ohio Department of Development without further details or sources.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that being the 9th largest exporting state means Ohio companies export more goods and services globally than 41 other states. However, this assumption may not be accurate as there could be other factors to consider, such as population size or specific industries.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Ohio's ranking as the 9th largest exporting state. It does not provide any analysis or comparison with other states to determine the reasons behind this ranking."}
