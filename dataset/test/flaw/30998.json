{"Exaggeration": "The claim exaggerates the idea that Facebook is deleting the image of a cross carved in honor of fallen firefighters.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that Facebook is deleting the image.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Facebook would delete the image due to its religious nature, without providing any explanation or evidence for this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert suggests that the claim may be a result of a rumor or misinformation, and that Facebook's community guidelines do not ban religious content."}
