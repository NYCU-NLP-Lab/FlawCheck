It does not provide any specific data or sources to support this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that birthright citizenship is practiced by only 30 countries without providing any explanation or justification for this assumption.

It does not consider other factors such as historical or cultural reasons that may influence a country's citizenship policy."}
