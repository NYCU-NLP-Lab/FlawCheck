{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Democrats voted down tuition assistance for children of military members killed in action. The expert's verdict clarifies that there was a specific bill in New York State that was blocked, but it does not represent a national trend or a complete denial of assistance to military families.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or sources to back up the statement that Democrats voted down tuition assistance for children of military members killed in action. The expert's verdict mentions that there is no federal legislation that has been blocked by the Democratic party nationally.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Democrats voted down the bill solely based on the fact that they approved giving free tuition to illegal aliens. However, the expert's verdict clarifies that the eligibility expansion for military families was eventually bypassed by the Democratic Governor in New York.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider the alternative explanation that the eligibility expansion for military families was eventually approved by the Democratic Governor in New York, bypassing the decision made by the New York Assembly Democrats."}
