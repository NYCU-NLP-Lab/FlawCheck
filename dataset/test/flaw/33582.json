{"Contradict fact": "The claim of the photo showing a crowd sprawling from Capitol to Washington Monument is contradicted by the expert's verdict, which states that the photo was actually taken in 1997 at a different rally.", "Exaggerate": "Bloggers and supporters of the tea party protests exaggerated the crowd size, with some estimating the number of people between 1 million and 2 million based on information from people in the crowd.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a single photograph, which turned out to be from a different event.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the photo accurately represents the crowd size at the tea party protests, which is a problematic assumption given the evidence that the photo is from a different rally.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The alternative explanation is that the photo was taken at a different event, the Promise Keepers rally in 1997, and not at the tea party protests as claimed."}
