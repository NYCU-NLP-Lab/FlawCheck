{"Falters at times": "The claim falters at times because it suggests that the Republican National Committee has completely barred any intraparty challenges to President Trump's re-election bid, which is not entirely accurate.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support because it does not provide sufficient evidence or sources to back up the assertion that the RNC has completely barred intraparty challenges.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that the RNC's resolution supporting Trump overrides any possibility of a primary challenge, without considering the rules that allow for a candidate to be placed into nomination if they win majority support in at least five states.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the alternative explanation that although the RNC has expressed support for Trump, it is still technically possible for candidates within the GOP to run against him as primary challengers."}
