Additionally, the claim that all families receive checks of $980 every 2 weeks is false, as clarified by a spokesperson for Canada's Ministry of Finance.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understating in the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by inaccurately stating that schools in Canada are closed for the rest of the year. The information provided shows that schools will reopen in September in most provinces, with some provinces already allowing students to return to classrooms.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is contradicted by the provided information about the reopening of schools, the absence of mortgage and rent freezes for the entire year, and the clarification from the Ministry of Finance regarding the checks to families.", "Problematic assumption": "There is no clear problematic assumption in the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is no alternative explanation provided in the claim."}
