{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the trade deficit between the United States and Japan by stating that it is anywhere from $69 billion to $100 billion a year, which is about 50% larger than the actual size of the deficit.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific data or sources to back up the stated range of the trade deficit.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that a trade deficit with Japan is inherently negative without considering other factors or the overall balance of trade in goods and services.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the trade deficit, such as the United States having a more favorable balance of trade in services.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the actual data provided by the U.S. Census Bureau, which shows that the trade deficit with Japan in goods has been consistent in recent years, ranging from $67 billion to $69 billion.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by presenting an upper estimate for the trade deficit that is almost twice as large as the actual goods-and-services deficit."}
