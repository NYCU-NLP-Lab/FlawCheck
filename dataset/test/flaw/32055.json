{"Understate": "The claim may understate the issue by simply stating that the state has fewer STEM graduates than any neighboring state, without providing further context or comparison to national averages.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the statement that the state has fewer STEM graduates than any neighboring state. The evidence provided only compares raw numbers and percentages of STEM graduates without considering other factors such as population size or specific degree programs.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that having fewer STEM graduates is a negative outcome without providing any justification or explanation for why this is problematic.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the lower number of STEM graduates in the state, such as differences in educational resources, funding, or career opportunities, that are not addressed in the claim."}
