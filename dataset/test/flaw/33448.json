{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that immigrants in the country illegally \"get welfare benefits\" while United States citizens don't get what they're looking to give illegal immigrants. The expert's verdict clarifies that the task force recommendations do not provide immediate enrollment of immigrants for welfare and do not prioritize benefits for immigrants over U.S. citizens.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Joe Biden's policy favors immigrants illegally in the country over U.S. citizens. The expert's verdict highlights that the task force recommendations do not deny benefits to U.S. citizens or give immigrants illegally in the country an upper hand.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it does not provide specific evidence or data to substantiate the assertion that immigrants in the country illegally receive welfare benefits while U.S. citizens do not.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the task force recommended extending health care coverage to immigrants illegally in the country through the Affordable Care Act marketplace, which is not considered a form of welfare.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation could be that the claim is a misinterpretation or misrepresentation of the task force recommendations and Joe Biden's policy intentions. The expert's verdict clarifies that the task force recommended easing federal benefits restrictions on immigrants lawfully present in the United States, not those illegally in the country.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by presenting a misleading and distorted view of Joe Biden's policy on immigrants in the country illegally. The expert's verdict highlights the inaccuracies and misrepresentations made by the claim."}
