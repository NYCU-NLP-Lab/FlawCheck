{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the cost of the pens used by Nancy Pelosi, stating that they were worth $15,000, $450,000, or $2,025 per pen, which is not supported by evidence.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Nancy Pelosi used $15,000 worth of pens to sign the articles of impeachment.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the cost of the pens used by Nancy Pelosi was excessively high without providing any factual basis for this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the alternative explanation provided by Drew Hammill, Pelosi's deputy chief of staff, who stated that the pens used cost just under $15 apiece and were the same type of pen used for signing other pieces of legislation."}
