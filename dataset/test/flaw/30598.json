{"Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict states that they couldn't find anything to corroborate the tweet about climate change and Texas freezing over. This suggests that there is a lack of evidence or support for the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Ted Cruz tweeted, \"I'll believe in climate change when Texas freezes over.\" However, the expert's investigation found no credible evidence of this tweet, indicating that the assumption made in the claim may be problematic.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that they found a meme of Cruz with the words in the tweet appearing over an image of his face, labeled as \"satire.\" This suggests that there could be an alternative explanation for the existence of the tweet, such as it being a satirical meme rather than an actual tweet by Ted Cruz."}
