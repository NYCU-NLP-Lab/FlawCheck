{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the situation by stating that cases, numbers, and deaths of COVID-19 are going down all over the country, without acknowledging that there are still areas where the virus is spreading and cases are increasing.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the ongoing transmission and growing epidemics in certain locations, as mentioned by the expert. It fails to acknowledge that the virus has not disappeared and that there are still areas experiencing significant numbers of cases.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the assertion that cases, numbers, and deaths are going down all over the country. The expert's verdict provides a more nuanced view, mentioning both the declining trend in many states and the rising number of cases in some states.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the decreasing trend in cases and deaths in some areas applies uniformly to the entire country. However, the expert's verdict highlights the patchwork pattern of the pandemic, with different areas experiencing different trends.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the declining numbers, such as the implementation of mitigation measures or changes in testing strategies. The expert's verdict provides a more comprehensive analysis of the factors contributing to the observed trends."}
