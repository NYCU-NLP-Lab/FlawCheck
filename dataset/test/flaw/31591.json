{"Contradict fact": "The claim in the ad contradicts the fact that Biden has explicitly stated that he does not support defunding the police.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it presents images of signs and a painted slogan, but does not provide any concrete evidence or examples to support the assertion that Biden fails to stand up to radical leftists.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Biden's opposition to defunding the police means he is not standing up to radical leftists, without considering alternative approaches or reforms that he supports.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation to the claim, which is that Biden supports reforms and changes in policing, but does not support defunding the police. This alternative explanation is supported by Biden's statements and his campaign spokesman's statement."}
