{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the number of tax and fee increases supported by Maggie Hassan. The expert's verdict states that the Bartlett Center analysis found 35 new or increased taxes and fees, while Lamontagne's campaign accused her of supporting \"nearly 100 taxes and fees.\"", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support as the Lamontagne campaign officials declined to release their list of nearly 100 tax and fee increases. Instead, the expert's verdict relies on the Bartlett Center analysis, which is based on research from the Office of the Legislative Budget Assistant.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that supporting tax and fee increases is equivalent to being a \"serial tax-and-spender.\" This assumption may be problematic as it does not consider the context and reasons behind the tax and fee increases.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the tax and fee increases, such as the effects of the recession on New Hampshire and the need to raise state revenues.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Maggie Hassan was voted out of office after supporting the tax and fee increases. The expert's verdict states that she served three two-year terms in office, suggesting that she was not voted out solely based on her support for tax and fee increases.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the impact of the tax and fee increases by not providing specific details about their effects on state revenues and spending.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times by using vague language and generalizations, such as accusing Maggie Hassan of \"liking high taxes\" without providing specific evidence or examples."}
