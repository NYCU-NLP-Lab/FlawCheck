{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a digitally altered image and there is no actual Crystal Methodist Church in Effing, South Carolina.", "Problematic assumption": "The assumption that the church sign is real and represents the views of a real church is problematic, as it is a fictional creation from a Facebook page.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation that the church sign is a humorous creation from a Facebook page rather than a genuine sign from a real church."}
