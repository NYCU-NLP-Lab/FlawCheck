{"Exaggerate": "The claim made by O'Donnell that the unemployment rate in New Castle County almost doubled in the last two years is found to be an exaggeration. The expert's analysis shows that the increase was actually 58 percent, not 100 percent as claimed.", "Lack enough support": "The claim made by O'Donnell lacks enough support as she did not provide any evidence or specific data to back up her statement. The expert had to rely on official statistics to analyze the unemployment rate.", "Problematic assumption": "O'Donnell's claim assumes that the rise in unemployment in New Castle County is solely attributable to Coons' tenure as County Executive. However, the expert points out that unemployment is influenced by various national and international economic factors, making it problematic to assign direct blame to a local official.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's analysis contradicts the claim made by O'Donnell, indicating that the unemployment rate did increase in the last two years but not to the extent of almost doubling as she suggested.", "Falters at times": "The expert notes that Coons misstated the time frame used by O'Donnell in her claim, which shows a momentary faltering in his response during the debate.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert acknowledges that there are alternative explanations for the rise in unemployment, suggesting that it may be influenced more by national and international economic factors rather than local ones."}
