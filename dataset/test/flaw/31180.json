{"Exaggerate": "The claim in the email sent by the opposition group states that the switch from a property tax to an increased sales tax is not a \"tax swap\" but a \"revenue increase of over 300 percent.\" This is an exaggeration as it refers to the change in the PSTA operating budget, not individual taxpayer's increase.", "Understate": "The claim in the email also states that the tax is permanent and there will never be a vote on it again. This could be considered an understatement as it fails to acknowledge that any future changes to the Greenlight plan, such as an extension of the proposed rail line or other major alteration, would be subject to a referendum.", "Lack enough support": "The claim in the email does not provide enough evidence or support to back up the statement that the tax is permanent and there will never be a vote on it again. It is stated as a definitive fact without sufficient explanation or proof.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim in the email assumes that the switch from a property tax to an increased sales tax is unfair without providing a clear rationale or justification for this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim in the email fails to acknowledge that the interlocal agreement between the PSTA and the county commission for the Greenlight Pinellas plan does not specifically guarantee a future vote on the sales tax increase. This alternative explanation challenges the claim that there will never be a vote on the tax again."}
