{"Understate": "The claim may understate the extent to which the U.S. government lacks information on visa holders leaving the country through land ports of entry. The expert's verdict mentions that Customs and Border Protection officers don't systematically collect data on every single person crossing via land, and that it is challenging to obtain advance information from land travelers.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack sufficient support as it does not provide specific data or evidence to back up the assertion that the U.S. government has \"no clue\" about visa holders leaving the country through land ports of entry.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that tracking visa holders and harmonizing entry-exit systems with Mexico and Canada would solve the issue of not having information on visa holders leaving the U.S. However, it does not address potential challenges or limitations in implementing such systems.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why the U.S. government may not have sufficient information on visa holders leaving through land ports of entry. The expert's verdict mentions physical, logistical, and operational obstacles that limit data collection from land travelers."}
