{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the number of bodies being buried together, as it states that 200 bodies were buried altogether, but this number is not supported by the evidence provided.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough supporting evidence to prove that the bodies shown in the video are indeed bodies of dead novel coronavirus patients in Russia. The evidence provided only includes comments from people in the video and a report from a Russian TV channel, but there is no direct confirmation or verification of the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the bodies shown in the video are related to COVID-19, but this assumption is not explicitly supported by the evidence provided. The video itself does not mention COVID-19, and the connection to the virus is made based on the context and the fact that it was shared in the context of the pandemic.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the video, such as the possibility that it could be a scene from a music video shoot, as mentioned in the caption of the video posted by the TikTok account @adrialclear.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the video is from a music video shoot, as reported by Russian media outlet Mash and confirmed by the TikTok account @adrialclear. The claim presents the bodies in the video as real corpses, while the evidence suggests that it was a staged scene.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by presenting conflicting information, such as the claim that the incident occurred in Russia, while other posts circulating on Facebook claim it occurred in Italy. This inconsistency raises doubts about the accuracy and reliability of the claim."}
