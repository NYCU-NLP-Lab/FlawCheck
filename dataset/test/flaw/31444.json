{"Lack enough support": "PolitiFact was unable to find any evidence of the billboards described by the claimant. They repeatedly asked for billboard photos or any other evidence that would support the claim, but received no response.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that billboards in Central America advertise how to grab a kid to enter the United States illegally. However, there is no evidence to support this assumption.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the existence and purpose of billboards in Central America. Experts who study immigration and have traveled to Central America have stated that they have never heard of or seen such billboards.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that traveling with a child does not guarantee entry into the United States, legal or illegal, nor does it guarantee a path to citizenship.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the reasons why people flee Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador, as it only mentions poverty and gang violence as top reasons, while there may be other factors contributing to migration.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the lack of evidence of the billboards, such as the possibility that they do not exist or that they serve a different purpose than claimed."}
