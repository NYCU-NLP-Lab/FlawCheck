{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of Kashmiris protesting against the Indian government's move by stating \"Millions of #Kashmiri rally in IOK against @narendramodi Govt.\"", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough supporting evidence to prove that the video shows Kashmiris protesting against the Indian government's move. The video is actually a three-year-old video of a funeral procession.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the video is not related to the recent development in J&K and does not show a protest against the Indian government's move.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video shows Kashmiris protesting against the Indian government's move based on the tweet by Ali Haider Zaidi, without verifying the authenticity of the video.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the video, such as it being a funeral procession of a militant rather than a protest against the Indian government."}
