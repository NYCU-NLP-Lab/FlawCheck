This suggests that there may be a lack of sufficient evidence or support for some aspects of the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the tombstone marks the resting place of Kate McCormick, who died after a botched abortion. However, the expert's verdict mentions that the tombstone was placed on her grave more than a century after her death, which raises questions about the assumption made in the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the doctor who was charged with providing McCormick with abortion-inducing drugs was ultimately acquitted. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations or interpretations of the events leading to McCormick's death, which could challenge the claim's assertion about a botched abortion.", "Contradict fact": "The claim states that McCormick died after a botched abortion, but the expert's verdict does not explicitly confirm or deny this. It only mentions that she claimed to have taken abortion-inducing drugs. Therefore, there may be a contradiction between the claim and the available facts.", "Understate": "The claim does not provide extensive details or evidence to support its assertion about McCormick's death and the circumstances surrounding it. This could be seen as an understatement of the complexity and ambiguity of the case.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict mentions that some facts of the case are still unclear and that they have pieced together the events to the best of their ability. This suggests that the claim may falter or be uncertain in certain aspects due to the lack of complete information."}
