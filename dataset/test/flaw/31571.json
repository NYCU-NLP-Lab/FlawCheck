{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by attributing a direct quote to Abraham Lincoln that he did not actually say.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence or documentation to prove that Abraham Lincoln made the specific statement mentioned in the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that the quote attributed to Abraham Lincoln is accurate without providing sufficient evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation that the quote is a paraphrased synopsis of something Lincoln said, rather than his actual words, as acknowledged by the PragerU meme."}
