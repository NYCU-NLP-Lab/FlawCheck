{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which juvenile crime rates triple between 3 and 6 p.m. It is based on data from nearly two decades ago and from eight states, not specifically New Jersey.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on data from a 2000 study that analyzed data from 1991 to 1993 in eight states, not specifically New Jersey.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that after-school programs are the main factor in keeping children out of trouble and that without such programs, crime rates would rise. This assumption may not consider other factors that could contribute to juvenile crime rates.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the increase in juvenile crime rates during the specified time frame. It attributes the increase solely to children being unsupervised, without considering other potential factors."}
