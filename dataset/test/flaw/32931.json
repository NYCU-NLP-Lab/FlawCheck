{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating Miami-Dade's achievement by stating that it is the \"first community in the world to break the cycle of local transmission of the Zika virus.\" While it did successfully clear its local transmission zones, it is not the only community in the world to have done so.", "Understate": "The claim may be seen as understating the ongoing risk of Zika virus in Miami-Dade by declaring that it has completely broken the cycle of local transmission. The CDC still considers Miami-Dade a \"cautionary area\" and warns that isolated cases could continue to appear.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the statement that Miami-Dade is the \"first community in the world\" to break the cycle of local transmission of the Zika virus. It is not clear if other communities have also achieved this milestone.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that breaking the cycle of local transmission of the Zika virus is a significant achievement, without providing any context or comparison to other communities or regions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the possibility that other communities or regions may have also successfully broken the cycle of local transmission of the Zika virus, but their achievements may not have been widely reported or recognized."}
