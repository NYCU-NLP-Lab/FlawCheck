{"Exaggerate": "The claim states that schools in some states are spending up to 100 days a year on test-prep or actual testing. This could be seen as an exaggeration because it may not apply to all schools in all states.", "Lack enough support": "The claim is supported by two reports, one from the National Center for Fair and Open Testing and another from the Central Florida Public School Board Coalition. However, the data in these reports is not recent and may not accurately represent the current situation in all states.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that spending up to 100 days a year on test-prep or actual testing is excessive or detrimental to students' education. This assumption may not be universally agreed upon and could be subjective.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative reasons for schools spending a significant amount of time on test-prep or actual testing. Other factors, such as state or federal requirements, could contribute to the amount of time dedicated to testing.", "Contradict fact": "There is no contradictory information provided in the text that directly refutes the claim.", "Understate": "The claim does not understate the amount of time spent on test-prep or actual testing, as it suggests that schools in some states are spending up to 100 days a year on these activities.", "Falters at times": "The claim does not falter at times as it consistently states that schools in some states are spending up to 100 days a year on test-prep or actual testing."}
