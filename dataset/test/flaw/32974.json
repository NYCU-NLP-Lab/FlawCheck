{"Exaggerate": "The claim of \"18 million illegal immigrants\" receiving government checks is exaggerated, as experts estimate the total number of undocumented immigrants in the U.S. to be around 10-11 million.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that 18 million illegal immigrants received government checks.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that undocumented immigrants are eligible for government assistance, which is not the case for most benefits.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that unauthorized immigrants are hardly eligible for government assistance, making it unlikely for them to receive checks.", "Understate": "N/A", "Falters at times": "N/A", "Exist alternative explanation": "N/A"}
