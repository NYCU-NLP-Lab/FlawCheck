{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of school shootings in Georgia by including incidents that do not fit the common understanding of a school shooting, such as accidental discharges and incidents outside of school grounds.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to justify the statement that Georgia has had more school shootings than any other state. The report's methodology and criteria for counting school shootings are questionable, and experts have raised concerns about the accuracy of the data.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all incidents counted by Everytown for Gun Safety as school shootings should be considered as such, even if they do not involve an intruder or student shooting at innocent classmates and staff. This assumption is problematic as it expands the definition of a school shooting beyond common understanding.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for the high number of school shootings in Georgia, which is the broad definition used by Everytown for Gun Safety. By including incidents that do not align with the common understanding of a school shooting, the number of incidents in Georgia is inflated compared to other states."}
