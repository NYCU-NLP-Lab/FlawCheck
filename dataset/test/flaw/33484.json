{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the frequency of meetings going past 10 p.m. and midnight by stating that the \"majority\" of meetings have extended past 10 p.m. and \"many\" have gone past midnight. The evidence provided does not support this level of frequency.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the majority of meetings have extended past 10 p.m. and many have gone past midnight. The evidence provided only mentions one specific meeting that went past midnight, and there is no data or statistics provided to support the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the length of the meetings, such as the inclusion of public testimony on specific topics like ridesharing services and rental property regulations, as mentioned in the expert's verdict. These specific issues may have contributed to the longer duration of those meetings, rather than it being a common occurrence for all meetings.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the length of the meetings is a disservice to the community, city staff, and council members without providing any specific evidence or reasoning to support this assumption. It may be subjective to determine whether the length of the meetings is truly a disservice.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the issue by not acknowledging the efforts made by the new council to reduce the length of meetings. The expert's verdict mentions that Mayor Steve Adler vowed to end late-night meetings, indicating that there have been attempts to address the issue.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the previous council's meetings lasted an average of 9 hours, 31 minutes, which is longer than the claim suggests. The claim also contradicts the fact that the new council and its committees spent significantly more hours in meetings compared to the previous council, as revealed in an analysis by the Austin American-Statesman.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not providing a comprehensive analysis of meeting lengths and relying on anecdotal evidence from one council member's statement. It does not provide a balanced perspective on the issue."}
