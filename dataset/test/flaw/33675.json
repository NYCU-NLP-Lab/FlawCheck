{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the impact of the 1958 decision by stating that the Warren court asserted by itself that the Supreme Court was supreme over the president and the Congress. This may be an overstatement of the actual ruling and its implications.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack sufficient evidence or support to back up the assertion that the Warren court made such a declaration. The expert's verdict mentions that Gingrich cited the case of Cooper vs. Aaron as a basis for his claim, but it does not provide further evidence or analysis to support this assertion.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the 1958 decision by the Warren court led to a fundamental assault on liberties by the courts and an increasingly arrogant judiciary. This assumption may be problematic as it does not consider alternative factors or explanations for changes in the judiciary over time.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for changes in the judiciary and assumes that the 1958 decision was solely responsible for any perceived negative developments. It does not explore other potential factors that may have influenced the role and power of the judiciary."}
