{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of Americans who will be able to get healthcare next year because of the law. The expert's verdict states that only about 1 million more Americans will gain health insurance next year, whereas the claim suggests that 30 million Americans will be able to get healthcare next year.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or data to back up the statement that 30 million Americans will be able to get healthcare next year because of the law.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the law will be fully implemented next year and that all the provisions will be in effect, allowing 30 million Americans to get healthcare. However, the expert's verdict clarifies that the individual mandate, Medicaid expansion, and establishment of insurance exchanges do not kick in until 2014, and it is only then that millions of Americans are expected to gain access to health insurance.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or factors that may affect the number of Americans who will be able to get healthcare next year. It simplifies the issue by attributing the increase solely to the law, without considering other factors such as economic conditions, availability of healthcare providers, or individual choices.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by incorrectly stating that 30 million Americans will be able to get healthcare next year, when in fact, the expert's verdict clarifies that the full implementation of the law is expected to result in 30 million Americans gaining health insurance by 2016, not next year.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement in the claim."}
