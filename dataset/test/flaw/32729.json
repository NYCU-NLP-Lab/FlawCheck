{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it is based on a screenshot from a Facebook post and a figure from a US-based online platform that relies on crowd-sourced data, which is not considered statistically accurate.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times because it presents conflicting numbers and arguments from different sources, leading to confusion and uncertainty about the actual average salary of Ontario public school teachers.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the average salary of Ontario public school teachers is $56,000, without providing solid evidence or considering other factors that may affect teacher salaries.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the different numbers and arguments presented in the claim, such as differing methodologies or sources used to calculate average salaries.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the information provided by the Ontario Ministry of Education, which states that the average provincially funded teacher salary was higher in 2018-2019 than the claimed average of $56,000.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the average salary of Ontario public school teachers if the actual average salary is higher than $56,000, as suggested by the Ontario Ministry of Education's reported numbers.", "Exaggerate": "There is no clear evidence of exaggeration in the claim, as it presents a lower average salary figure compared to the Ontario Ministry of Education's reported numbers. However, the conflicting information and lack of solid support may contribute to an overall sense of exaggeration or misinformation."}
