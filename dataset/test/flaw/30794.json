{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of Gov. Maggie Hassan's budget proposal by stating that it \"raises taxes on small businesses and increases taxes and fees by $100 million.\" The actual amount of tax increase is disputed and varies depending on the proposal being examined.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that reverting to earlier tax rules and code revisions would result in an increase in taxation for small businesses, without providing sufficient evidence or analysis to support this assumption.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide enough support or evidence to substantiate the assertion that Gov. Hassan's budget proposal raises taxes on small businesses and increases taxes and fees by $100 million. The evidence cited is from an op-ed in 2011 and statements made by the state director of Americans for Prosperity.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the proposed changes in tax rules and code revisions, such as promoting fairness and ensuring businesses can substantiate their tax credits. The claim does not consider these alternative explanations."}
