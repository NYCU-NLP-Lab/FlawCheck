{"Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that they have not been able to track down the specifics of the video and have not been able to confirm the information provided by The Sun or the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of Australia.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video shows a priest aggressively dunking a baby underwater during a baptism ceremony, but the expert's verdict states that the man seen in the video is not a Greek Orthodox priest and that such practices are not condoned in the Greek Orthodox Church.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that it is not uncommon for babies to be dunked underwater during the baptismal process in certain regions of the world, although perhaps not as aggressively as shown in the video. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations or variations in baptism practices.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict contradicts the claim that the video shows a priest aggressively dunking a baby underwater during a baptism ceremony by stating that the man seen in the video is not a Greek Orthodox priest and that the actions captured on camera are physically abusive and not condoned by the Greek Orthodox Church.", "Exaggerate": "The expert's verdict mentions that the video shows the baby being dunked repeatedly and somewhat violently underwater, which could be seen as an exaggeration of the actual events captured in the video.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of any biases that understate the claim or downplay the severity of the actions shown in the video.", "Falters at times": "There is no evidence of any biases that cause the expert's verdict to falter at times or be inconsistent in its assessment of the claim."}
