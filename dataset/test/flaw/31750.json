{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on viral videos on social media without any concrete evidence or verification.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the videos of crocodiles were recently spotted in Hyderabad during heavy rains, but the expert's verdict states that both videos do not represent incidents that took place recently.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the first video was viral last year during Bihar floods with the claim that a crocodile was spotted in Patna, debunking the currently widespread claim.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the issue by not providing enough context or information about the severity of the situation in Hyderabad due to heavy rains and flooding.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the videos, such as the crocodiles being from a different location or the videos being staged or manipulated."}
