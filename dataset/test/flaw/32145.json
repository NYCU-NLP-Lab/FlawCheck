{"Understate": "The claim states that the Trump administration is spending 90 percent less on advertising for Obamacare open enrollment in 2018. The expert's verdict confirms that the budget for publicizing the enrollment has been cut by more than 90 percent. Therefore, the claim underestimates the actual reduction in advertising spending.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific evidence or data to support the statement that the Trump administration is intentionally trying to make Obamacare fail. While it mentions the reduction in advertising budget and enrollment period, it does not provide sufficient evidence to support the assumption that the administration's motive is to replace Obamacare with an alternative plan.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Trump administration's motive for cutting the advertising budget and enrollment period is to make Obamacare fail and replace it with another plan. This assumption is not supported by concrete evidence and relies on speculation about the administration's intentions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the budget cuts and shortened enrollment period. It assumes that the motive is to undermine Obamacare, but there could be other reasons such as cost-saving measures or a shift in strategy.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of the budget cuts by stating that the Trump administration is spending 90 percent less on advertising. While it is true that the budget has been significantly reduced, the claim does not provide a comparison to previous years or the actual dollar amount of the reduction.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not contradict any factual information provided by the expert's verdict. The expert confirms that the budget for advertising and enrollment assistance has been cut by the Trump administration.", "Falters at times": "The claim does not appear to falter at any specific point. It presents a clear statement about the budget cuts and shortened enrollment period without any inconsistencies or contradictions."}
