{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support its assertion that the photograph shows a sign that reads \"Caution: Tomatoes\" with an arrow pointing to the left. The expert's verdict provides information about the existence of the sign, but it does not provide any direct evidence or proof of the specific content of the photograph in question.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the photograph accurately represents a sign that reads \"Caution: Tomatoes\" with an arrow pointing to the left. However, the expert's verdict does not explicitly confirm or verify this assumption. It only states that the sign exists and provides information about its context and purpose.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the possibility of alternative explanations for the photograph. It assumes that the sign is as described without exploring other potential interpretations or contexts. The expert's verdict provides some background information about the sign's purpose as a mascot for a community garden, but it does not explore alternative explanations for the content of the photograph.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the significance or novelty of the photograph. The expert's verdict mentions that the image of the sign frequently appears in memes and lists of off-beat signs, suggesting that it may not be as unique or unusual as the claim implies.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not directly contradict any facts presented in the expert's verdict. However, it may be contradicted if the photograph does not actually depict a sign that reads \"Caution: Tomatoes\" with an arrow pointing to the left. Without further evidence, it is difficult to determine if this contradiction exists.", "Understate": "The claim does not appear to understate any information or evidence. It simply presents a specific assertion about the content of the photograph.", "Falters at times": "The claim does not explicitly falter or make inconsistent statements. However, without further evidence or verification, its accuracy and reliability may be questionable."}
