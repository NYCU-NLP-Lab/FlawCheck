{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which the Georgia and Kansas Capitol buildings were stormed by protesters.

While the reports indicate smaller groups and attempts to breach the buildings, the claim does not provide a comprehensive picture of the situation.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient supporting evidence to confirm that the Georgia and Kansas Capitol buildings were indeed stormed by protesters. News reports indicate smaller gatherings and attempts to breach the buildings, but the claim does not provide concrete evidence or specific details.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the incidents at the U.S. Capitol in Washington D.C. on January 6th led to similar incidents at the Georgia and Kansas Capitol buildings. However, the evidence presented in the news reports suggests smaller gatherings and attempts to breach the buildings, which may not be directly comparable to the events in Washington D.C.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the presence of protesters at the Georgia and Kansas Capitol buildings. The reports suggest that some protesters were there to deliver grievances or participate in peaceful rallies, which may not necessarily indicate a storming of the buildings.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the scenes at the Georgia and Kansas Capitol buildings were not as severe or chaotic as the one at the U.S. Capitol. The news reports describe smaller groups and attempts to breach the buildings, but not a full-scale storming like in Washington D.C.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in accurately portraying the situation at the Georgia and Kansas Capitol buildings. While there were smaller gatherings and attempts to breach the buildings, the claim does not provide a comprehensive or accurate representation of the events."}
