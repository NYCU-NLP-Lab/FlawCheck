{"Exaggerate": "The claim that Biden was sworn in on an upside-down Bible in 2021 is exaggerated. The photo used to support the claim is from Biden's inauguration as vice president in 2009, not his inauguration as president in 2021.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence or credible source to confirm that Biden was sworn in on an upside-down Bible.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that an upside-down cross on a Bible is associated with Satanism, which is a problematic assumption. It does not take into account other possible explanations or interpretations of the gesture.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The alternative explanation is that the photo used to support the claim is from a previous inauguration and does not depict Biden's swearing-in as president in 2021."}
