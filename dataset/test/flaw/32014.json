{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the situation by stating that Africans in China are being \"forced to sleep outside in the cold.\" While there are reports of evictions and discrimination, it is not explicitly mentioned that they are being forced to sleep outside.", "Understate": "The claim does not appear to understate the situation.", "Lack enough support": "The claim is supported by numerous news reports and evidence of targeted evictions and discrimination against Africans in China.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the rising number of new coronavirus cases in China is solely blamed on Africans, which may be a problematic assumption as the Chinese government denies racism and focuses on preventing a second wave of the virus.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not provide an alternative explanation for the evictions and discrimination faced by Africans in China."}
