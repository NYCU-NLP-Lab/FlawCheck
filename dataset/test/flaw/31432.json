{"Lack enough support": "The claim that 40 passengers of the Air India Express plane crash at Kozhikode tested positive for coronavirus lacks credible news reports to back it up. The local government has also denied this claim.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the information provided by the District Collector's office, which stated that the claim is \"fake news.\" The District Collector tweeted that the claim of 40 passengers testing positive for coronavirus is not true.", "Understate": "It is possible that the claim may be understating the actual number of passengers who tested positive for coronavirus. The claim only mentions 40 passengers, while other sources mention at least two passengers testing positive.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all 40 passengers tested positive for coronavirus based on the deleted article and a tweet by a senior special correspondent. However, this assumption is not supported by credible sources.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the claim, such as misinterpretation of information or misinformation being spread intentionally."}
