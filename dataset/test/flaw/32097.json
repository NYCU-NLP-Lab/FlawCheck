{"Lack enough support": "The claim that Tennessee law requires schools to receive half of the proceeds from the sales tax increase is not supported with any evidence or specific reference to the law itself.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the sales tax increase will result in $31 million per year for schools, without providing any explanation or evidence for this assumption.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the impact of the sales tax increase on education funding by stating that it will make a significant difference in improving schools without providing any concrete evidence or data to support this claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that opponents of the sales tax increase argue that it is premature to levy an additional tax until a clearer picture of the exact budget needs of the consolidating school systems is available. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the need for the tax increase, beyond what is claimed by Stand for Children."}
