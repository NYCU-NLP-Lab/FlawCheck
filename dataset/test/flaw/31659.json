{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the amount of money that the average woman will have lost throughout her working career as a result of the pay gap. The expert's verdict explains that the calculation is based on multiplying the pay gap by 40 years, which may not accurately represent the actual loss experienced by women.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the assertion that the pay gap is the sole cause of the average woman losing $431,000 throughout her working career. The expert's verdict mentions that there are other factors, such as occupational choices and time off for child-related reasons, that contribute to the pay gap.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the entire pay gap between men and women is solely due to sex discrimination. The expert's verdict highlights that other factors, such as occupational choices and educational attainment, also contribute to the pay gap.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions alternative explanations for the pay gap, such as women choosing lower-paying occupations and having degrees leading to lower-paying jobs. This suggests that there are factors other than sex discrimination that contribute to the pay gap."}
