{"Understates": "The claim may understate the amount of taxes paid by the top 1 percent and top 50 percent of income earners. The expert's verdict states that the top 1 percent paid 36.7 percent of the taxes, but it does not provide information on the total percentage of income earned by this group. Without this information, it is difficult to determine if the top 1 percent is paying a fair share of taxes.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support to fully evaluate its accuracy. While the expert's verdict mentions consulting the Tax Foundation report and other sources, it does not provide specific details or data from these sources to verify the claim. Without more information, it is challenging to determine the accuracy of the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the share of taxes paid by the top income earners is a fair representation of their tax burden. However, it does not consider other factors such as loopholes, deductions, and the overall distribution of wealth. These factors could potentially skew the perception of the top income earners' tax burden.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the distribution of tax payments. It presents the data as evidence that the wealthy are already paying a significant portion of the taxes, without exploring other possible factors such as income inequality or the potential benefits of a progressive tax system.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in its attempt to address the misconception on wage earners and income taxes paid. While it presents data on the percentage of taxes paid by different income groups, it does not provide a comprehensive analysis of the overall tax system or address other relevant factors that could impact the fairness of the tax burden.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may potentially exaggerate the tax burden of the top income earners. Without further information on the total percentage of income earned by the top 1 percent and top 50 percent, it is challenging to determine if their tax payments are proportionate to their income."}
