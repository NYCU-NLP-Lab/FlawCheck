{"Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity of Romney's position on contraception coverage by employers. The expert's verdict mentions that Romney sidestepped the issue of insurance coverage and instead focused on whether employers can tell someone whether they can have contraceptive care. This suggests that the claim may not fully capture the nuances of Romney's stance.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack sufficient evidence or support to definitively state that Romney suggested that \"employers should be able to make the decision as to whether or not a woman gets contraception through her insurance coverage.\" The expert's verdict mentions Romney's support for the Blunt amendment, but it does not provide direct quotes or specific instances where Romney explicitly made the suggested statement.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim may not consider alternative explanations for Romney's position on contraception coverage. The expert's verdict highlights that Romney's focus was on whether employers can dictate contraceptive care, rather than insurance coverage specifically. This suggests that there may be alternative interpretations or explanations for Romney's stance that the claim does not acknowledge."}
