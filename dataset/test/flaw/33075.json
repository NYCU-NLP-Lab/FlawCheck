{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the amount of money saved by stating that paying in cash for the projects funded by the sales tax saved Gwinnett County more than $1 billion in interest payments. This could be an overstatement of the actual savings.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to validate the estimate of more than $1 billion in interest payments saved. It does not provide specific details or evidence to back up this estimate.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that if the county had borrowed the money instead of collecting it in sales taxes, they would have incurred $1 billion in interest payments. This assumption may be problematic as it does not consider alternative financing options or potential changes in interest rates over time.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the claimed savings, such as different financing strategies or cost-saving measures implemented during the projects. The claim does not explore or acknowledge these alternative explanations."}
