{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of Somali refugees settled in Minnesota during Obama's presidency. The actual number is one-seventh of the amount claimed in the meme.", "Understate": "The claim understates the number of Somali refugees settled in Minnesota during the final seven years of the George W. Bush presidency, which was higher than during Obama's presidency.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it presents a meme without providing any reliable sources or evidence to back up the numbers mentioned.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of Somali refugees settled in Minnesota directly correlates with Ilhan Omar's election, without considering other factors that could have influenced the election outcome.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Ilhan Omar's election, such as her campaign strategy, political platform, or voter demographics."}
