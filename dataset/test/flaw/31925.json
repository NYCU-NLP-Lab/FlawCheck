{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the statement that every U.S. president since 1976 has declared at least one national emergency. The expert's verdict mentions that there have been several dozen national emergencies declared since 1976, but it does not provide a comprehensive list or specific details for each president.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that every U.S. president since 1976 has declared at least one national emergency without questioning or examining the individual actions of each president. The expert's verdict acknowledges that there were some discrepancies in the numbers provided by the Brennan Center, indicating that the assumption may not be entirely accurate.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict mentions that their tally based on the Brennan Center's list differs slightly from the numbers stated in the claim. This suggests that the claim may falter or be inconsistent in accurately representing the number of national emergencies declared by each president.", "Exist alternative explanation": "While the claim implies that every U.S. president since 1976 has declared at least one national emergency, there could potentially be alternative explanations or factors that contribute to the declaration of national emergencies. The expert's verdict mentions various reasons for past national emergencies, such as hostage situations or trade restrictions, indicating that there may be alternative explanations for each declaration."}
