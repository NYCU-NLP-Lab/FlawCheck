{"Understates": "The expert's verdict may understate the existence of \"colored only, no whites allowed\" signs during the Jim Crow era. They mention that few people nowadays are surprised to learn about \"Whites Only\" signs, but state that the existence of \"Blacks Only\" or \"Coloreds Only\" signs seems to flummox a lot of people. This suggests that the expert may be downplaying the prevalence of such signs.", "Lack enough support": "The expert mentions that they have searched in vain for evidence to back up the claim that signs like this are currently \"appearing on college campuses\" in the United States. This suggests that there may be a lack of sufficient evidence to support this specific aspect of the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The expert's verdict includes a statement that the sign depicted above, which is a \"colored only\" sign from 1921, is hardly an example of racism against white people. This assumption could be problematic as it dismisses the possibility of racism against white people based on the specific example provided.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert provides an alternative explanation for the existence of the \"colored only\" sign, stating that it was originally displayed at a black-owned movie theater where African American patrons were not relegated to sitting in the back rows. This alternative explanation suggests that the sign may have been intended to create a safe and equal space for African American patrons rather than promoting racial segregation."}
