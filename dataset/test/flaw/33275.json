{"Understate": "The claim may understate the impact of Biden's tax plan by not acknowledging that some lower earners could experience slightly lower after-tax incomes due to indirect effects of the proposed corporate tax rate increase.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or data to back up the assertion that 82% of Americans would experience a tax increase if Biden were elected.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that Biden and the opponent would raise taxes by $4 trillion on 82% of Americans without providing sufficient evidence or context.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation provided by experts that the tax increases proposed by Biden would primarily affect corporations and the top 20% of earners, rather than 82% of Americans.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Biden has pledged not to raise taxes on Americans making less than $400,000 per year, as reported by PolitiFact.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the potential tax increase for Americans by not considering the specific scenarios and conditions under which some households under $400,000 could experience \"potential direct tax hikes\" related to itemized deductions, retirement benefits, and payroll taxes."}
