{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the increase in the cost of cancer drugs from $10,000 a year to $10,000 a month. While there has been a significant increase, the exact figures may not be as extreme as stated.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the actual increase in the cost of cancer drugs. The expert's verdict mentions that the monthly average cost of drugs approved in 2015 is $11,319, which is higher than the claimed $10,000.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the statement that cancer drugs cost about $10,000 a year 15 years ago. The expert's verdict mentions that it is difficult to determine the average annual cost due to the varying treatment durations and administration of drugs.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim attributes the increase in cancer drug costs to pharmaceutical companies owning the U.S. government. However, the expert's verdict does not provide evidence to support this claim or explore alternative explanations for the rising costs.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in cancer drug costs is solely due to the influence of pharmaceutical companies. While there may be some truth to this, other factors such as research and development costs, regulatory requirements, and market dynamics can also contribute to the rising prices."}
