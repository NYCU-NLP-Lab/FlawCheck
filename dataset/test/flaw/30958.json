{"Exaggerate": "The claim states that sanitation coverage has increased from 16% to 25%.

Without sufficient supporting information, the claim may lack enough support.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in sanitation coverage is solely due to efforts by county governments. However, it does not consider other factors or alternative explanations that could have contributed to the increase.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not explore any alternative explanations for the increase in sanitation coverage. It does not consider factors such as changes in population, infrastructure development, or external interventions that could have influenced the increase.", "Falters at times": "The claim does not provide a consistent or comprehensive analysis of sanitation coverage. It only presents the increase in coverage without discussing any challenges or limitations that may exist.", "Contradict fact": "Without additional information or data, it is difficult to determine if the claim contradicts any specific facts or evidence. However, if the increase in sanitation coverage is not supported by reliable data, it could potentially contradict the actual situation on the ground."}
