{"Lack enough support": "The claim that Gov. Tony Evers \"has never had a real job\" lacks sufficient evidence or support. The expert's verdict provides information about Evers' previous work experience, including working in cheese factories and as a caregiver.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the assumption that working in education, as a teacher, principal, district superintendent, and State of Wisconsin Superintendent of Public Instruction, does not constitute a \"real job.\" This assumption is subjective and can be considered problematic.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Evers' work experience. The expert's verdict highlights Evers' diverse professional resume, which includes various positions in education.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by oversimplifying Evers' work experience and dismissing his roles in education as not being \"real jobs.\" This oversimplification overlooks the complexities and responsibilities of these positions.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Evers did have previous jobs, including working in cheese factories and as a caregiver. This contradiction undermines the claim's assertion that Evers has never had a real job.", "Understate": "The claim understates Evers' work experience by disregarding his roles in education and the responsibilities associated with those positions."}
