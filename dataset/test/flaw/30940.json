{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the percentage of net new jobs created in Texas that went to the foreign-born. The actual percentage is stated to be 81% according to the Center for Immigration Studies, while the claim states it as 80%.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or sources to support the statement that 80% of the net new jobs created in Texas since 2009 went to the foreign-born. The source mentioned in the expert's verdict is a memo from the Center for Immigration Studies, but it is not clear if this is the only source or if there is additional data to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The memo from the Center for Immigration Studies makes assumptions about the characteristics of illegal residents in Texas, such as being young, male, unmarried, younger than 40, and having little schooling. These assumptions may not be accurate or applicable to all illegal residents, making the conclusion about the percentage of jobs filled by illegal immigrants questionable.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim attributes the preference for foreign-born workers by U.S. employers as one reason for the pessimism and anger among disaffected white voters. However, there may be alternative explanations for their mood, and it is not clear if the preference for foreign-born workers is the sole or primary cause.", "Contradict fact": "The claim states that the net new jobs created in Texas since 2009 went to the foreign-born, while the expert's verdict clarifies that the data from the Center for Immigration Studies actually refers to jobs created since 2007. This contradiction raises questions about the accuracy of the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in terms of accuracy by stating that 80% of the net new jobs created in Texas since 2009 went to the foreign-born, while the actual percentage is stated as 81% according to the expert's verdict. This inconsistency suggests a lack of precision in the claim.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in the provided claim."}
