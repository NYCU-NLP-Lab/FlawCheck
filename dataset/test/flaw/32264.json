{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the size of the rat, stating that it weighed twelve pounds, while the expert's verdict suggests that the size was exaggerated in both the claim and the image.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support its assertion about the size of the rat, as the estimates were based on the photographer's subjective observation rather than actual measurements.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the rat in the photograph is a London rat, but the expert's verdict suggests that the size of the rat is too big for London rats, based on studies and expert opinions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for the claim, suggesting that the weight of the rat was converted incorrectly from kilograms to pounds, leading to an overblown claim."}
