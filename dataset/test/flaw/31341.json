{"Falters at times": "The expert's verdict suggests that the claim made by Governor Scott Walker falters at times, specifically when he states that collective bargaining would remain \"fully intact.\" The expert questions this statement and highlights the potential inconsistency or inaccuracy of the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that collective bargaining is fully intact under the budget-repair bill, but the expert's analysis suggests that this assumption may be problematic. The expert points out that collective bargaining and civil service protections are not the same, implying that the claim oversimplifies the situation.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that they have asked for evidence from Walker's spokesperson to support the claim, but as of the publication time, they had not received a response. This suggests that the claim may lack sufficient supporting evidence to back up its assertion.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's analysis raises the question of why thousands of workers continue to protest if collective bargaining rights are fully intact under the bill. This implies that there may be alternative explanations for the protests, suggesting that the claim may not provide a complete understanding of the situation."}
