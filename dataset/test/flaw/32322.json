{"Understate": "The claim may understate the extent to which Ohio is not meeting its obligation to update voter registrations when voters change their address with the BMV. The expert's verdict mentions that Ohio's rate of registrations and registration updates from BMV transactions is far lower than the national average, suggesting a more significant problem than implied by the claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific evidence or data to support the assertion that Ohio is not meeting its obligation. While the expert's verdict mentions the non-partisan Pew Center report and State Rep. Kathleen Clyde's statement, it does not provide concrete evidence or statistics to fully support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Ohio has an obligation to update voter registrations when voters change their address with the BMV. While the expert's verdict cites the National Voter Registration Act of 1993, it does not provide a comprehensive analysis of the legal obligations and requirements, leaving room for alternative interpretations.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the problems with voter registration in Ohio. The expert's verdict mentions flaws in maintaining Ohio's voter database and high rates of provisional ballots, but it does not explore other potential factors contributing to these issues.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there is no evidence of voter fraud found in Ohio. The expert's verdict explicitly states that no evidence of voter fraud was found, suggesting that the claim's implication of voter registration problems leading to fraud may be unfounded."}
