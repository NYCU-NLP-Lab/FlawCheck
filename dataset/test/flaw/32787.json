{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to establish a clear connection between veterans, marijuana use, and suicide. The expert's verdict mentions that the studies on this topic have produced mixed results, indicating a lack of consensus or conclusive evidence.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes a causal relationship between THC (a component of marijuana) and suicide among veterans. However, the expert's verdict suggests that other factors, such as coping with post-traumatic stress or adjusting to civilian life, could confound the association between marijuana use and suicide.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that there could be alternative explanations for the association between veterans, marijuana use, and suicide. It suggests that factors like trauma or other risk factors might contribute to the observed relationship, rather than marijuana use alone.", "Understate": "The claim states that \"70 percent had THC\" without providing further context or comparison. This could be an understatement as it fails to mention the percentage of veterans without THC in their blood or the prevalence of THC in the general population.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not directly contradict any known facts, as it mentions the existence of a study. However, it does not provide enough information to determine the validity or reliability of that study."}
