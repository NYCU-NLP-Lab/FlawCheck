{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it is based on vague comments made by Bloomberg in a 2012 interview and does not reflect his current policy stance in 2020.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Bloomberg wants to ban guns holding more than three rounds based on his comments about limiting the speed and number of rounds a gun can fire. However, he did not explicitly state support for a limit of three rounds.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Bloomberg does not have a policy in 2020 to ban guns holding more than three rounds.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate Bloomberg's stance on gun control by simplifying his comments from 2012 and presenting them as a definitive proposal to ban guns with more than three rounds.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times by not accurately representing Bloomberg's current position on gun control and relying on outdated comments from 2012.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for Bloomberg's comments, such as a focus on limiting the speed and rapidity of firing rather than a specific ban on guns holding more than three rounds."}
