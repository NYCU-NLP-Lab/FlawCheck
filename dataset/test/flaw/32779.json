{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific data or evidence to back up the statement of \"67% growth\" in water customers and \"0% more water used.\"", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in water customers automatically means there was no increase in water usage. This assumption may not be accurate as there could be other factors influencing water usage.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The data provided by the water system's vice president for public affairs shows that there was a 68% increase in population served and a 2.9% decrease in water produced. This suggests that there could be alternative explanations for the claim, such as improved water efficiency measures or fluctuations in water usage due to weather conditions.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times as the data provided for different time spans shows fluctuations in both population served and water usage. This indicates that the claim may not accurately represent the overall trend.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the actual increase in water usage by only focusing on the most recent data available. The data for the 1986-2011 time span shows a 52% increase in customers alongside a 21% increase in water used, which is higher than the claim suggests.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there was an increase in water usage over certain time spans, as shown by the data provided. This contradicts the claim of \"0% more water used.\""}
