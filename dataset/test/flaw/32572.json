{"Understate": "The claim underestimates the potential for pipelines to freeze during extreme weather conditions.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that pipelines do not freeze.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that pipelines are naturally insulated and therefore cannot freeze, without considering other factors that may contribute to freezing.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the statements made by grid operators and Governor Greg Abbott, who acknowledged that frozen pipelines were a problem during the winter storm.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the problems experienced by gas-fired power plants during the storm, such as frozen wellheads and transmission lines."}
