{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the influence of Putin's request on Obama's decision to withdraw the missile defense program. While Cheney states that Obama withdrew the plans \"at the mere request from Putin,\" the expert's analysis suggests that there were multiple factors and considerations involved in the decision.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Obama's decision to withdraw the missile defense program was solely based on Putin's request, without considering other factors such as the changing geopolitical landscape and the evolving threat from Iran.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to conclusively prove that Obama withdrew the plans solely due to Putin's request. The expert's analysis provides a more nuanced explanation of the decision, considering various factors and statements made by Obama and his administration.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Obama's decision, such as the evolving missile defense strategy focused on short- and medium-range Iranian missiles, or the concerns of American allies and NATO countries.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity of the decision-making process and the various factors involved, reducing it to a simple cause-and-effect relationship between Putin's request and Obama's withdrawal of the missile defense program.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Obama initially expressed support for the missile defense installations in Poland and the Czech Republic during the 2008 election. This contradicts the claim that Obama withdrew the plans solely at Putin's request."}
