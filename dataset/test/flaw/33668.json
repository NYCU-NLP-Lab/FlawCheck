{"Exaggerate": "The claim that \"the vast majority will be (filling out their taxes) on a single postcard\" exaggerates the simplicity and widespread adoption of the postcard filing option.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence or data provided to support the assertion that the majority of taxpayers will use the postcard filing option.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the new tax bill will have immediate effects and changes on the filing process, which is a problematic assumption as the bill's provisions only address tax year 2018 and beyond.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There are alternative explanations provided by experts that contradict the claim, such as the fact that taxpayers will still be filing under existing tax law, not the new law, and that there is no existing postcard filing option."}
