{"Understate": "The claim of the current government putting Nigeria into a debt of $80 billion is an understatement, as the actual debt at the time was $73.2 billion.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or data to back up the assertion of the government's role in the debt.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the entire debt is solely the responsibility of the current government without considering previous administrations' contributions to the debt.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the increase in debt, such as economic factors or external influences, which are not addressed in the claim."}
