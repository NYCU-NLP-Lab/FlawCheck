{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the increase in numbers of people being referred to the Channel \"deradicalisation\" scheme. While it is stated that referrals have been increasing each year, the actual magnitude of this increase is not provided.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the proportion of individuals under 18 being referred to the deradicalisation scheme. The expert's verdict mentions that over a third of referrals are children under the age of 18, indicating a significant proportion.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific data or statistics to support the statement about increasing numbers of referrals to the deradicalisation scheme. It only mentions that various news outlets have reported similar claims without providing concrete evidence.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in referrals is solely due to a rise in radicalization, without considering alternative explanations. The expert's verdict mentions that the increase in referrals over the summer has been linked to a new duty on teachers to prevent radicalization, suggesting that the increase may not solely be attributed to a rise in actual radicalization.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that the increase in referrals may be linked to the new duty on teachers to prevent radicalization. This alternative explanation challenges the assumption made in the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times by not providing a comprehensive analysis of the data and trends related to referrals to the deradicalisation scheme. It does not mention any potential limitations or factors that could affect the interpretation of the data."}
