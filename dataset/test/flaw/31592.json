{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the reaction of Jokowi by stating that he was \"upset like a child\" over Saudi Arabian investment. The original news article only mentioned that he was \"disappointed\" with the investment.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that Jokowi was actually \"upset like a child\" over the investment. The misleading Facebook post provides a doctored image with a misleading headline, but it does not provide any credible sources or evidence.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Jokowi's reaction to the Saudi Arabian investment reflects negatively on his leadership and the dignity of Indonesia. However, this assumption is not supported by any factual evidence or analysis.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the image in the misleading post has been doctored from an article published by news outlet Asian Correspondent in April 2017. The original article did not include the phrases \"The stupid president of Indonesia\" and \"upset like a child\" in its headline.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the doctored image and misleading post, such as a deliberate attempt to discredit Jokowi or spread false information about him. However, without further evidence or investigation, it is difficult to determine the exact motive behind the creation and dissemination of the misleading post."}
