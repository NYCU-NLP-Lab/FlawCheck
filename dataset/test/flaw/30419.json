{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the ease and speed at which DREAM Act beneficiaries can sponsor their illegal immigrant parents for legalization. The expert's verdict indicates that it is unlikely for DREAM Act beneficiaries to obtain citizenship by the age of 21, which suggests that the claim may be exaggerating the process.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or support to back up the assertion that DREAM Act beneficiaries can sponsor their parents for legalization once they turn 21. The expert's verdict mentions that the process is unlikely, which suggests a lack of support for the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that once DREAM Act beneficiaries become citizens and turn 21, they can automatically sponsor their illegal immigrant parents for legalization. However, the expert's verdict indicates that this assumption is problematic and may not align with the actual requirements and processes involved.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by stating that it is unlikely for DREAM Act beneficiaries to obtain citizenship by the age of 21. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations or limitations to the claim's assertion."}
