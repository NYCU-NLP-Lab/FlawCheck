{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating Trump's desire to have his image added to Mount Rushmore, as it presents his statement as a serious aspiration and suggests that he wants his face on the monument.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to fully support the assertion that Trump wants his image added to Mount Rushmore. It relies on statements from the New York Times, South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem, and an unnamed White House official, which may not be considered strong enough evidence.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Trump's tweet and statements from Governor Noem and the White House official are accurate and truthful, without considering the possibility of exaggeration or misinterpretation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for Trump's statements, such as using them as a form of political rhetoric or expressing admiration for the monument without a serious intention of being added to it."}
