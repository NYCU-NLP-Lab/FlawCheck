{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent of the decrease in crime rate during the mayor's tenure by stating it as the \"lowest crime rate in 30 years.\"", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that the city had the lowest crime rate in 30 years. The available data only goes back to 1960, and the statistics for the years after 2009 are not provided.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the decrease in crime rate during the mayor's tenure was directly caused by his actions or policies, without considering other potential factors that could have influenced the crime rate.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the decrease in crime rate, such as broader national or regional trends, changes in law enforcement strategies, or demographic shifts in the city.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the crime rate increased in 2010, according to the FBI data, which undermines the assertion of having the lowest crime rate in 30 years.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the actual crime rate by using the city's own numbers, which tend to be higher than the numbers reported by the FBI."}
