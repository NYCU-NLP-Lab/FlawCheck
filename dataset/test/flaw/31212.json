{"Lack enough support": "The claim that \"more than 40 percent of sales nationally are made without background checks\" is based on a 1997 National Institute of Justice study, which may not provide the most up-to-date and comprehensive data on current gun sales practices. The claim lacks recent and extensive research to fully support it.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the 1997 study accurately represents the current state of gun sales and background checks. However, it is possible that changes in laws and regulations since then have affected the prevalence of background checks in gun sales.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the 40 percent figure, such as the inclusion of legal exemptions or loopholes that allow certain sales to occur without background checks. The claim does not consider these alternative explanations, which could impact the accuracy of the statement."}
