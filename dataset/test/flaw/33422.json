{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the statement that black voter turnout exceeded white voter turnout in states with strict voter ID laws.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that voter ID laws do not suppress the minority vote based on the higher black voter turnout in 2012. However, experts caution that voter ID laws may still attempt to suppress minority votes.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that voter ID laws were not in effect in some of the states where black voter turnout was higher than white voter turnout.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the impact of voter ID laws on voter turnout by stating that black voter turnout exceeded white voter turnout nationally and in states with strict voting laws.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in its argument by acknowledging that the impact of stricter voter ID laws on voter turnout is difficult to gauge due to various factors influencing turnout.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the higher black voter turnout, such as other factors that may have contributed to the turnout difference in states with strict voter ID laws."}
