{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the number of jobs occupied by illegal immigrants by stating that it is exactly 8 million, without considering the potential changes in economic conditions since the data was collected.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient current data to support the assertion that illegal immigrants currently occupy 8 million jobs, as the data used for the estimate is over 20 months old.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all jobs occupied by illegal immigrants are \"stolen\" from citizens and legal immigrants, which can be seen as a problematic assumption without further evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the decrease in the number of jobs occupied by illegal immigrants since the data was collected, such as the impact of economic conditions and job loss."}
