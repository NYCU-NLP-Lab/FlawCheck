{"Understates": "The claim understates the fact that Baltimore's per pupil spending is only the third highest among the 100 largest school districts, not among all school districts nationwide.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it fails to provide evidence or data to back up the statement that Baltimore's schools are \"lousy\" despite their spending.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that high per pupil spending should automatically lead to better outcomes in schools.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the performance of Baltimore's schools, such as the fraction of adults in the district with a four-year college degree, which has been found to be a strong predictor of high scores.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Baltimore ranks 160th in spending among school districts with at least 5,000 students, which shows that there are many districts that spend more.", "Exaggerates": "The claim exaggerates the significance of Baltimore's per pupil spending by only considering the 100 largest school districts and ignoring the hundreds of other districts that spend more.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by oversimplifying the complex issue of improving Baltimore's schools and suggesting that it is not about money, despite the existence of studies on both sides of the debate."}
