{"Understate": "The claim may understate the potential impact on the graves of U.S. veterans, as it only mentions the fear of some people and does not provide concrete evidence of the potential disturbance.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or specific examples to support the assertion that the graves of U.S. veterans will be dug up to build the border wall.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the construction of the border wall will directly lead to the digging up of graves, without providing clear evidence or logical reasoning to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or possibilities for protecting the graves, such as legislative plans and vows by U.S. Customs and Border Protection to protect the site."}
