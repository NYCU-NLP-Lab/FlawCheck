{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the impact of Dan Patrick's vote against funding to test the backlog of rape kits by stating that it allowed rapists to walk free. The expert's verdict suggests that the long-term effects of the funding may lead to investigations and prosecutions, but it does not directly link Patrick's vote to immediate release of rapists.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that the basis of the claim is Patrick's vote against the final version of the 2014-15 state budget. However, it does not provide further evidence or data to support the claim that this vote directly resulted in allowing rapists to walk free. Therefore, the claim may lack enough support.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that by voting against funding for testing backlogged rape kits, Dan Patrick directly allowed rapists to walk free. However, the expert's verdict suggests that the impact of the funding on investigations and prosecutions may be a long-term effect, and it does not directly link Patrick's vote to immediate release of rapists. This assumption may be problematic.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the funding for testing backlogged rape kits was a result of legislation passed in 2011, and it was expected to cover outsourcing costs for testing. Therefore, there may be an alternative explanation that the funding was already allocated before Patrick's vote, and his vote against the budget may not have directly impacted the testing of rape kits."}
