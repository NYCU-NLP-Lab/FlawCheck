{"Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that inhaling steam over 100\u00b0C will \"disintegrate\" the coronavirus because it is \"fat\", without providing enough evidence or scientific support for this assumption.", "Lack enough support": "There is no evidence provided to support the claim that inhaling steam can treat the virus, and experts have warned against the practice.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the virus replicates in cells and cannot be disintegrated simply by inhaling steam.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the effectiveness of steam inhalation as a treatment for Covid-19, without sufficient scientific basis.", "Understate": "The claim understates the potential danger of inhaling steam, as experts have warned against the practice.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or treatments for Covid-19, focusing solely on steam inhalation."}
