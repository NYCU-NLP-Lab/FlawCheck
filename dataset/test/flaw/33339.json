{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent of the issue by stating that the American Red Cross is charging all victims of Hurricane Harvey for their services, when in fact, the Red Cross has stated that all disaster assistance is provided free of charge.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the accusation that the American Red Cross is charging victims of Hurricane Harvey for their services. The only evidence provided is a statement from a 2005 Huffington Post article, which the expert could not find direct evidence for.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that because the Red Cross charged WWII soldiers for off-base food and lodging in the past, they are currently charging disaster victims. This is a problematic assumption as it does not take into account any changes in the organization's policies or practices.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the rumors, such as misunderstandings or misinformation being spread. It solely focuses on the accusation of charging victims without exploring other possibilities.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the American Red Cross has stated that all disaster assistance is provided free of charge."}
