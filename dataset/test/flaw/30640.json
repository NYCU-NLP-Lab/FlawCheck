{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerated as it states that tax cuts approved and proposed in the budget \"will exceed $8 billion by the time the budget is done.\" This suggests that the tax cuts will definitely reach or surpass $8 billion, which may be an exaggeration.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the $8 billion figure. It mentions that the number comes from estimates by the Wisconsin State Budget Office and experts at the Legislative Fiscal Bureau and Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance, but it does not provide detailed information or analysis to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the tax cuts proposed in the budget will be approved and implemented. However, the budget remains stalled in the Legislature, so it is uncertain whether all the proposed tax cuts will be passed and effectively implemented.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the projected $8 billion tax cuts. The claim mentions that the majority of the tax cuts come from existing, ongoing cuts related to manufacturing, agriculture, and income tax. It is possible that the projected $8 billion figure includes these ongoing cuts rather than solely relying on the proposed tax cuts in the budget."}
