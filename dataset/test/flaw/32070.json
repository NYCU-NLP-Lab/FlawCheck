{"Understate": "The claim may be understating the issue of school capacity by stating that only one in six secondary schools are at or over capacity, while the expert's verdict mentions that 15% of state-funded secondary schools in England were at or over capacity in 2014 (one in seven).", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support or evidence to back up the statement that 95% of applicants received an offer at one of their top three preferred schools last year. The expert's verdict mentions that this figure has fallen slightly over the last two years, but no specific evidence or data is provided to support the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that the increase in pupil numbers may start to affect the 95% offer rate in future years. This alternative explanation is not mentioned in the claim, which presents the 95% offer rate as a current and ongoing situation without considering potential future impacts.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact mentioned in the expert's verdict that 15% of state-funded secondary schools in England were at or over capacity in 2014, while the claim states that only one in six secondary schools are at or over capacity.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the positive outcome of 95% of applicants receiving an offer at one of their top three preferred schools. The expert's verdict mentions that this figure has fallen slightly over the last two years, indicating that it may not be as high as presented in the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the current offer rate of 95% will remain unchanged in the face of a predicted 20% rise in the number of secondary school pupils over the next decade. This assumption may be problematic as it does not consider the potential impact of increased demand on school capacity and offer rates.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not providing enough context or considering other factors that may influence the offer rate and school capacity. It presents a positive outcome without acknowledging potential challenges or limitations."}
