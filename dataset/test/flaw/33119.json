{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent of the requirement by stating that Gov. DeSantis wants to extend the standardized test requirement to preschoolers. The expert's verdict states that there is no evidence of such tests being added for preschoolers.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence provided to support the statement that Gov. DeSantis wants to extend the standardized test requirement to preschoolers.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Gov. DeSantis wants to extend the standardized test requirement to preschoolers without providing sufficient evidence or sources to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for Gov. DeSantis' call for more accountability, such as focusing on accountability among pre-K providers rather than directly testing preschoolers. The expert's verdict mentions an unspecific call for more accountability, which suggests that there could be alternative explanations for the proposed policy."}
