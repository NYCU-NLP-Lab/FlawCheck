{"Exaggerate": "The claim made by Kellyanne Conway exaggerates the findings of the Mueller report by stating that it concluded there was \"no obstructive conduct\" by President Trump, when in fact the report did not draw a conclusion on obstruction of justice.", "Lack enough support": "Conway's claim lacks enough support as it contradicts the findings of the Mueller report, which explicitly states that it does not exonerate Trump of obstruction of justice.", "Problematic assumption": "Conway's claim assumes that because the Mueller report did not draw a conclusion on obstruction of justice, it means there was \"no obstructive conduct.\" This assumption is problematic as it overlooks the fact that the report also does not exonerate Trump.", "Contradict fact": "Conway's claim contradicts the fact that the Mueller report explicitly states that it does not exonerate Trump of obstruction of justice.", "Understate": "The claim understates the significance of the Mueller report by focusing on what it doesn't say (e.g., no collusion, no new indictments) rather than acknowledging the lack of exoneration on obstruction of justice.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation to Conway's claim is that the lack of a conclusion on obstruction of justice in the Mueller report does not necessarily mean there was \"no obstructive conduct.\" It leaves room for interpretation and further investigation."}
