{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the percentage of guns sold without background checks, stating it as 40% when the most recent data shows it to be 13%.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the most recent data available, which shows a lower percentage of guns sold without background checks.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on outdated data from a nearly 24-year-old survey.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the 40% figure is still accurate and relevant, even though more recent and comprehensive data is available.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the discrepancy in the percentages, such as changes in gun purchasing patterns or improvements in background check systems."}
