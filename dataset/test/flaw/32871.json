{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent of the problem by stating that 37 percent of the 428,000 students receiving free and reduced-price lunches are ineligible, without providing enough evidence to support this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support or evidence to substantiate the assertion that 37 percent of the students are ineligible.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the state auditor's analysis of the three percent of applications is reflective of all approved applications, which may be a problematic assumption.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the number of ineligible students by only considering the 37 percent found in the auditor's report, while the auditor projected that 58,000 students may be ineligible.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the errors found in the auditor's report, such as administrative errors or misunderstandings, which are not explored in the claim."}
