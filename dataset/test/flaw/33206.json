{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Vice President Kamala Harris put her clutch on top of the Bible so her hand is not touching it. This is not true as the object on top of the Bible is another Bible, not a clutch or handbag.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a Facebook post that has been flagged as false news and misinformation. Other fact-checkers have also debunked the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Vice President Harris intentionally avoided touching the Bible by placing her clutch on top of it. However, this assumption is incorrect as the object on top of the Bible is another Bible, not a clutch.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim ignores the alternative explanation that Vice President Harris placed another Bible on top of the one she was being sworn in on as a symbolic gesture or to honor former Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Vice President Harris took the oath of office on two Bibles, one belonging to a close family friend and the other belonging to Thurgood Marshall.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by misrepresenting the object on top of the Bible as a clutch when it is actually another Bible.", "Understate": "There is no significant understatement bias present in the claim."}
