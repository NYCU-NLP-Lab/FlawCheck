{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of pages of government regulations, as the actual number is slightly higher than the 81,000 cited.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that there are too many government rules stifling small businesses.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of pages in the Federal Register directly correlates with regulatory activity and burden, which is a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the increase in the number of pages, such as changes in the complexity of regulations or the need for more detailed explanations.", "Understate": "The claim understates the percentage of pages in the Federal Register that actually contain regulations or final rules, as only 31 percent of pages from 2010 to 2014 contained rules.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that not all pages in the Federal Register contain regulations or final rules, as there are also notices, presidential documents, and other non-regulatory items included.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not acknowledging the limitations and criticisms of using page counts as a measure of regulatory activity or burden, as highlighted by the Congressional Research Service report."}
