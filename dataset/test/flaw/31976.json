{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the impact of slot machines on generating revenue for schools by stating that they have only generated 20 percent of the promised $500 million per year.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that slot machines have only generated 20 percent of the promised revenue.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the promised $500 million per year for schools was solely dependent on slot machines, without considering other potential sources of revenue or funding for schools.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not explore alternative explanations for why slot machines may not have generated the full promised amount, such as changes in economic conditions or fluctuations in gambling activity."}
