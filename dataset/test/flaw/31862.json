{"Exaggerate": "The claim states that the United States is \"the only developed country in the world that has not cut its corporate tax rate.\" This may be an exaggeration as there may be other developed countries that have not cut their corporate tax rates.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific evidence or data to support the statement that the United States is the only developed country that has not cut its corporate tax rate. It only mentions the Doing Business Project's reports, which do not specify whether the cuts were to statutory rates or effective rates.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that cutting corporate tax rates is necessary or beneficial for the private sector to prosper. It does not consider alternative economic policies or factors that may contribute to the private sector's success.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not explore alternative explanations for why the United States has not cut its corporate tax rate. There may be political, economic, or other reasons behind this decision that are not addressed in the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in its accuracy or completeness, as it does not provide a comprehensive analysis of all developed countries' corporate tax rate changes. It only mentions the countries listed in the Doing Business Project's reports.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Iceland, a developed country, raised its corporate tax rate during the period covered by the reports. This contradicts the claim that the United States is the only developed country that has not cut its corporate tax rate."}
