{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the viewership numbers for Trump's town hall (190,000) and Biden's town hall (20,000), as the actual numbers were much higher (10.9 million for Trump and 14.1 million for Biden).", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or sources to support the stated viewership numbers.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that viewership numbers alone determine the outcome of an election, suggesting a potential bias towards the importance of popularity.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the difference in viewership numbers, such as differing time zones and livestream options.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the actual viewership numbers reported by Nielsen, which were significantly higher than the numbers stated in the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by relying on social media posts and screenshots as evidence, without verifying the accuracy or sources of the information.", "Understate": "The claim understates the viewership numbers for both town halls, as the actual combined total was 13.5 million, not the claimed 190,000 and 20,000."}
