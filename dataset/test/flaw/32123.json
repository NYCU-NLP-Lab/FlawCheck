{"Exaggerate": "The expert's verdict states that the claim of the law making it a felony for same-sex couples to apply for a marriage license is an exaggeration of what the actual law represents.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim was widely misreported and that the revisions included a clause that spurred concerns, but it does not provide specific evidence or support for these statements.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Mike Pence signed a bill specifically barring same-sex couples from seeking marriage licenses, but the expert's verdict explains that the bill did not create a new law or specify a harsher penalty for the existing law.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict explains that the clause in the bill could be applicable to anyone who performed a same-sex wedding ceremony, not just same-sex couples seeking marriage licenses. This suggests an alternative explanation for the intent of the bill."}
