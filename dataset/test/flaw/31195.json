{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that all of the candidates controlled by Madigan have said that a massive income tax hike is the answer to their problems. It is not clear if all the candidates have made such statements.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that a Democratic victory for governor would automatically result in a graduated-rate income tax for Illinois, which may not be the case.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that all the candidates controlled by Madigan have advocated for a massive income tax hike as the solution to their problems.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the candidates' support for a progressive tax system, such as addressing income inequality or funding public services adequately.", "Understate": "The claim may underestimate the difficulty of amending the Illinois Constitution to impose a progressive tax system, as it requires significant legislative approval and voter support.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Democrats, even with three-fifths majorities in the House and Senate, have not been able to pass ballot referendums for a limited graduated income tax plan."}
