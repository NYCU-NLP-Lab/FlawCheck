{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or proof to support the assertion that the photograph captures United Airlines passengers wearing protective crash helmets. The only evidence provided is the photograph itself, which is later debunked as being unrelated to United Airlines passengers.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the photograph is a genuine depiction of United Airlines passengers wearing crash helmets. However, this assumption is proven to be false when it is revealed that the photograph was taken during a safety training course for employees of another company.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the photograph does not actually show United Airlines passengers wearing protective crash helmets. The background signage in the image indicates a different airline, and a spokesperson from that airline confirms that the people in the picture are not passengers but employees participating in a safety training.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The alternative explanation for the photograph is that it was taken during a safety training course for employees of another company, rather than depicting United Airlines passengers wearing crash helmets."}
