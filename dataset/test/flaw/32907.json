{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the potential risk of catching Covid-19 by stating that cutting the distance from 2m to 1m might double the risk. The expert's verdict mentions that it is not clear which relative effect is being referred to, and the doubling of risk is based on an assumption.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support as it is based on the assumption mentioned above. The expert's verdict mentions that it is not clear from the research paper which relative effect is being referred to.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim is based on the assumption that cutting the distance between people from 2m to 1m might double the risk of catching Covid-19. The expert's verdict mentions that this assumption is consistent with figures elsewhere in the research paper, but it is not explicitly stated in the paper.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not provide alternative explanations for the potential increase in risk when cutting the distance between people from 2m to 1m. The expert's verdict mentions that wearing masks or eye protection might also substantially lower the risk, but this is not mentioned in the claim."}
