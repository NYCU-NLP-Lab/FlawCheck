{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered as an exaggeration because it states that \"actual deportations from the interior of the country are way down\" under President Obama, implying a significant decrease in deportations.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the statement that deportations from the interior of the country have significantly decreased under President Obama.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that a decrease in deportations from the interior of the country indicates a lack of enforcement or being \"soft\" on immigration, which may be a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the decrease in interior deportations, such as changes in immigration policies, shifts in enforcement priorities, or other factors not mentioned in the claim.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that interior deportations have actually fallen between 40 and 60 percent during Obama's term, as supported by the figures provided by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).", "Understate": "The claim may be considered an understatement because it fails to acknowledge the significant decrease in interior deportations during Obama's term, as confirmed by the ICE figures.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not providing a clear source for the statement and requiring further investigation and clarification."}
