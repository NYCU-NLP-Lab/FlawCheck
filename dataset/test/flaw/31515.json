{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the Al-Shabaab jihadist group was killed by Kenyan police on January 20. The provided information only mentions an attack by gunmen suspected to be from the Al-Shabaab group, but there is no confirmation of their death.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the individuals involved in the attack were members of the Al-Shabaab jihadist group without concrete evidence. It is based on local media speculation and not confirmed facts.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is a possibility that the attackers were not members of the Al-Shabaab group, as their identity is not confirmed. The claim assumes their affiliation without exploring other potential explanations.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the image used to support the claim has been previously used in 2015, suggesting that it may not be directly related to the incident on January 20.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the success of the Kenyan police in repulsing the attackers, as it states that they were killed without providing solid evidence.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the severity of the attack by only mentioning four civilians being injured. It does not provide a comprehensive overview of the incident or any potential casualties.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing a clear and consistent narrative. It includes multiple sources and statements that do not directly support the claim of the Al-Shabaab jihadist group being killed by Kenyan police."}
