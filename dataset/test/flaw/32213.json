{"Understate": "The claim may understate the difference in tax rates between the richest 400 taxpayers and a $29,000-a-year worker. The expert's verdict states that the average tax rate for the top 400 taxpayers was 16.6 percent, which is lower than the tax rate for the hypothetical worker.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the tax rate for the richest 400 taxpayers is lower than that of a $29,000-a-year worker. This assumption may be problematic as it does not take into account other factors such as deductions, exemptions, and credits that could affect the actual tax burden of both groups.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to fully validate the comparison between the tax rates of the richest 400 taxpayers and a $29,000-a-year worker. The expert's verdict mentions that they checked their own tax returns and found lower tax rates than the 16.6 percent mentioned by Senator Whitehouse, but it does not provide comprehensive data or analysis to support the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the difference in tax rates between the richest 400 taxpayers and a $29,000-a-year worker. The expert's verdict mentions that the tax rates for the top 400 taxpayers were based on average adjusted gross income and average income tax paid per return. This suggests that individual circumstances and tax planning strategies could significantly affect the actual tax rates of the richest taxpayers.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times in providing a clear and comprehensive comparison between the tax rates of the richest 400 taxpayers and a $29,000-a-year worker. The expert's verdict highlights the need for clarification regarding the source of the 16.6 percent figure and the tax year it represents. This lack of clarity can weaken the claim's credibility.", "Contradict fact": "The claim may contradict the fact that the richest 400 taxpayers are taxed at a lower rate than a $29,000-a-year worker. The expert's verdict confirms that the average tax rate for the top 400 taxpayers was indeed 16.6 percent, which supports the claim. However, without further evidence or analysis, it is difficult to determine if this difference in tax rates is significant enough to make a definitive comparison."}
