{"Exaggerate": "The claim of \"already lost 1.6 million jobs\" is higher than the estimate provided by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which projected a reduction of 750,000 jobs by the end of the year.", "Lack enough support": "The source of Reid's number is a CBO letter, which provides a forecast for what would happen in the future rather than concrete evidence of already lost jobs.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes a direct causation between sequestration and job losses without sufficient evidence or data to support this assumption.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict highlights the lack of official count or estimate for job losses due to the sequester, indicating that the claim may not be entirely reliable.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that there are other factors and alternative explanations for job losses, such as the overall state of the economy and the impact of reduced government spending."}
