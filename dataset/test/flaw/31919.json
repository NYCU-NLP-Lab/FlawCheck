{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the extent to which the Trump administration \"undid\" pattern-or-practice investigations of police departments. While it is acknowledged that these investigations have declined and are disfavored under Trump, they have not ceased altogether.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the fact that pattern-or-practice investigations were supported by the Obama administration. These investigations were initiated by the Obama administration and were part of their efforts to hold law enforcement agencies accountable for discrimination.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support in terms of providing specific evidence or data to back up the assertion that the Trump administration completely \"undid\" these investigations. The expert's verdict highlights that investigations have declined and are disfavored, but the exact extent of undoing is not clearly defined.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that pattern-or-practice investigations of police departments are universally accepted as necessary and effective in addressing discrimination. However, this assumption may be problematic as there are differing perspectives on the effectiveness and impact of such investigations.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the decline and disfavoring of pattern-or-practice investigations under the Trump administration. There may be other factors or reasons influencing this shift in approach."}
