{"Exaggerate": "The claim suggests that Carly Fiorina's statement about the increase in revenues is exaggerated, as it largely stems from the controversial merger with Compaq.", "Lack enough support": "The expert mentions that there is little support for Carly Fiorina's statement that revenues doubled after accounting for the combined revenues of HP and Compaq.", "Contradict fact": "The expert points out that total revenues for the merged company barely grew during Carly Fiorina's last full year as CEO.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the acquisition of Compaq by Hewlett-Packard was a terrible deal without providing sufficient evidence or analysis to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert mentions that Carly Fiorina attributes the negative outcomes of the merger, such as layoffs and lower stock prices, to the dot-com bubble burst rather than her leadership or the merger itself. This suggests an alternative explanation for the negative consequences."}
