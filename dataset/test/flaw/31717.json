{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the extent to which Republicans fought to protect tax loopholes for corporations that send jobs overseas. The expert's verdict mentions that there is no official tax break for shipping jobs overseas, suggesting that the claim may be exaggerated.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim is becoming a common one among Democrats, but it does not provide specific evidence or data to support the claim. Therefore, there may be a lack of enough support for the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Republicans fought to protect tax loopholes for corporations that send jobs overseas, without providing evidence or specific examples of their actions. This assumption may be problematic as it generalizes the actions of all Republicans.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that some Democrats are steamed about deductions for business costs that allow companies to deduct the costs associated with moving jobs overseas. This alternative explanation suggests that the claim may not solely be due to Republicans' actions, but also a result of existing tax laws and regulations.", "Falters at times": "The claim may be seen as faltering at times because it does not provide specific evidence or examples of Republicans' actions to protect tax loopholes for corporations that send jobs overseas. The expert's verdict mentions that there is no official tax break for shipping jobs overseas, further questioning the claim's accuracy.", "Understate": "There is no clear evidence of understatement in the claim or the expert's verdict."}
