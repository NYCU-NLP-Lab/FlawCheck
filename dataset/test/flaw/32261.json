{"Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that the incident was captured in photographs and that Vons acknowledged the incident took place at one of their stores. However, it does not provide further evidence or details to support the claim that the customer was wearing a Ku Klux Klan-like hood.", "Problematic assumption": "The expert's verdict mentions that the white head covering worn by the customer appeared to be a Ku Klux Klan hood. This assumption is based on the appearance of the head covering and may not necessarily be accurate.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the San Diego County Sheriff's Department is reviewing security video footage to identify the person seen in the pictures and may pursue criminal charges against him. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations or motives behind the customer's choice of head covering, which are not addressed in the claim.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict states that the photographs are real and were taken at a Vons grocery store in Santee, California. This contradicts any claims that the photographs are fake or staged.", "Understate": "The expert's verdict does not provide a clear conclusion or judgment on whether the claim is true or false. It provides information about the incident and mentions that the photographs are real, but it does not explicitly state whether the customer was indeed wearing a Ku Klux Klan-like hood.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict mentions that many viewers questioned whether the photographs were real or staged and why the shopper was allowed to wear such a get-up. This suggests that there may be some uncertainty or doubt surrounding the incident.", "Exaggerate": "There is no evidence of exaggeration in the expert's verdict."}
