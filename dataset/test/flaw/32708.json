{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific numbers or data to support the assertion that Rhode Island has the highest percentage of uninsured adults in New England. The expert's investigation found that the claim was based on a map developed by the CDC that categorized states into three groups, without providing specific numbers for each state.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that being in the \"in-between\" category of states with regards to health insurance coverage automatically translates to having the highest percentage of uninsured adults. However, this assumption is not supported by specific data or evidence.", "Falters at times": "The expert's investigation found that the claim falters in terms of providing accurate and reliable information. The lack of specific numbers and reliance on a categorization system by the CDC raises doubts about the accuracy of the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's investigation raises the possibility that there may be alternative explanations for the claim. The categorization system used by the CDC may not accurately reflect the percentage of uninsured adults in each state, and there may be other factors influencing the level of uninsured adults in Rhode Island compared to other New England states."}
