{"Understate": "The claim underestimates the potential impact of the American Health Care Act on people with pre-existing conditions.

However, the expert's verdict highlights that the legislation's language may allow insurers to impose unaffordable premiums for individuals with pre-existing conditions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict presents an alternative explanation by stating that the legislation permits insurers to set premiums based on an individual's health status, potentially resulting in higher costs for those with pre-existing conditions. This alternative explanation challenges the claim's assertion of protection for such individuals.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support to substantiate its assertion that people with pre-existing conditions are protected under the American Health Care Act. The expert's verdict provides evidence that the legislation may not adequately protect individuals with pre-existing conditions, as insurance companies could charge higher premiums or make coverage unaffordable.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the Affordable Care Act, adopted in 2010, already prohibits insurance companies from denying coverage or charging higher premiums based on pre-existing medical conditions. The expert's verdict highlights this contradiction by stating that the American Health Care Act does not approach pre-existing conditions in the same way.", "Exaggerate": "There is no clear evidence of exaggeration in the claim or the expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not providing enough evidence or addressing the potential negative consequences of the American Health Care Act for individuals with pre-existing conditions. The expert's verdict highlights the legislation's potential flaws and contradictions in protecting such individuals."}
