{"Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that military action is not a viable, feasible, responsible option for preventing a nuclear Iran, without providing sufficient evidence or reasoning to support this assumption.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide enough evidence or supporting information to back up the assertion that military action is not a viable option.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or perspectives for why Hagel might believe that military action is not a responsible option for preventing a nuclear Iran.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that President Obama has stated that all options are on the table for preventing a nuclear Iran, while Hagel is portrayed as saying military action is not a responsible option.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent of Hagel's position on military action, as it does not provide a direct quote or specific statement from Hagel indicating that military action is completely off the table."}
