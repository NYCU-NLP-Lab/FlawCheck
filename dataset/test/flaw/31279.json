{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that the photograph shows President Obama holding a Che Guevara t-shirt, when in fact it was a different t-shirt with a math joke about Moses' parting the waters.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the photograph in question was not taken during President Obama's visit to Cuba in 2016, as it suggests.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or sources to back up the assertion that President Obama was ignoring the terrorist attack in Brussels while honoring Che Guevara.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that President Obama's visit to Cuba and the photograph with the t-shirt are related to the terrorist attack in Brussels, without any evidence to support this connection.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation exists for the photograph, which is that it was taken at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and featured a different t-shirt unrelated to Che Guevara."}
