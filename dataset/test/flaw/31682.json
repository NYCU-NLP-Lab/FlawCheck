{"Understate": "The claim may be understating the issue by stating that only 60% of Texas 8th graders are not proficient in math, which implies that the problem is not as significant as it may actually be.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide any specific data or evidence to support the statement that 60% of Texas 8th graders are not proficient in math.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the lack of proficiency in math among Texas 8th graders is solely due to the fact that only 26% of them have a teacher with an undergraduate major in math. This may oversimplify the issue and ignore other potential factors contributing to the problem.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the lack of proficiency in math among Texas 8th graders, such as curriculum quality, teaching methods, or student engagement."}
