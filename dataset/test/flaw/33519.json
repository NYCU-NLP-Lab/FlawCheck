{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the number of jobs that will be created by the Atlanta streetcar project. The expert points out that the claim uses the term \"job years\" instead of actual positions, which could mislead readers into thinking there will be more jobs created than estimated by experts.", "Lack enough support": "The expert questions the validity of the job creation numbers provided in the claim. They mention that a similar claim made by a politician was debunked as false, as the numbers referred to \"job years\" rather than actual positions. This suggests that the claim may lack sufficient support or evidence to back up the job creation figures.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the job creation numbers provided in the grant application and the press release are accurate. However, the expert points out that the previous claim made by a politician using similar numbers was debunked as false. This raises concerns about the assumption that the job creation figures are reliable.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the job creation numbers provided in the claim. They mention that the numbers include positions needed to run the streetcar and positions created by new residences and businesses along the route. This implies that there may be other factors contributing to the job creation figures, rather than solely the construction of the streetcar."}
