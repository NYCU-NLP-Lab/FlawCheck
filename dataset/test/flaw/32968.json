{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the number of people who die as a result of gunfire each year. The expert's investigation found that the numbers cited in the claim were slightly higher or lower than the more recent data, indicating a possible exaggeration.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only cites one source, the Harvard Health Policy Review from 2001. The expert's investigation found more recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, indicating that the claim may not have enough support.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of deaths and injuries from gunfire has increased, stating that mass killings have gone from being rare to common occurrences. However, the expert's investigation does not provide evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the increase in deaths and injuries from gunfire. It suggests re-examining funding for mental health services and implementing stricter controls on ammunition and firearms, but there could be other factors contributing to the issue that are not addressed in the claim."}
