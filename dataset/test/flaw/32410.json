{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that police lathi-charged Congress workers for raising Pakistan Zindabad slogans. The accompanying videos and captions do not provide clear proof of this happening.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the police lathi-charged Congress workers solely because they raised Pakistan Zindabad slogans. However, alternative explanations for the police action are not explored or considered.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the videos shared do not actually show Congress workers raising Pakistan Zindabad slogans. The videos and accompanying information suggest that the slogans being chanted were different.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the debunking of the videos by multiple media outlets, including BBC Hindi, AFP, The Times of India, and India Today. This suggests that the claim's assertion of police lathi-charging Congress workers for raising Pakistan Zindabad slogans is not credible.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the police lathi-charge, such as crowd control measures, other provocative actions by the Congress workers, or any other factors that may have led to the police response.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance of the videos and their connection to the alleged lathi-charge. The videos may not provide sufficient evidence to support the claim's assertion."}
