{"Understate": "The claim may understate the number of National Guard members affected by stating that \"hundreds\" were made to vacate the Capitol and sent to the parking garage, while the expert's verdict mentions \"thousands\" of soldiers being deployed to provide security.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the conditions in the parking garage by stating that soldiers inhaled exhaust fumes, struggled to sleep under harsh lights, and had limited access to facilities. The expert's verdict provides accounts from soldiers about poor conditions, but it is unclear if all soldiers experienced these exact circumstances.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific details or evidence to support the reason for the soldiers' banishment to the parking garage. The expert's verdict mentions that no reason was given for their banishment, indicating a lack of support or explanation for this action.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the soldiers were \"made\" to vacate the Capitol and sent to the parking garage, implying a deliberate action. The expert's verdict mentions that soldiers were cycled into the garage during guard duty shifts to warm up and take a break, suggesting a different perspective on the situation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the soldiers being sent to the parking garage. The expert's verdict mentions that the soldiers had hotel rooms where they could rest after a shift, indicating that there may have been logistical reasons for using the parking garage as a temporary resting area.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not directly contradict any factual information provided in the expert's verdict. However, it may contradict the assumption that all soldiers experienced the same poor conditions in the parking garage, as the expert's verdict mentions that soldiers had hotel rooms for rest and not all guards were in the garage at the same time."}
