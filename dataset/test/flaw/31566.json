{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the significance of rain falling only on the Nataraja statue at the Thillai Nataraja temple. The video and accompanying tweets present it as a \"miracle\" and use phrases like \"observe, rain shower only on Lord Nataraja\" to emphasize the uniqueness of the event.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that rain only falls on the Nataraja statue at the temple. The expert's verdict mentions that there are other videos and posts debunking the viral claims, suggesting that there is alternative evidence contradicting the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that raindrops are more visible under street lights, and the video may have captured rain falling on the statue due to the temple's lighting. This suggests that there could be an alternative explanation for the apparent concentration of rain on the statue.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the rain falling on the Nataraja statue is a supernatural or miraculous event. This assumption is not supported by evidence and may be based on a biased belief in the divine nature of the statue.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in the claim."}
