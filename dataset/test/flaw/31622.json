{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the impact of raising the minimum wage to $10.10 by stating that it would \"help lift over a million Americans out of poverty.\" The expert's verdict mentions that the actual figure is close to a million, which suggests that the claim may have exaggerated the number.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific evidence or data to support the assertion that raising the minimum wage to $10.10 would lift over a million Americans out of poverty. It is not clear what research or studies the claim is based on.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that raising the minimum wage to $10.10 would directly lead to lifting over a million Americans out of poverty. However, the expert's verdict mentions that the Congressional Budget Office report estimates job losses ranging from \"a very slight reduction in employment\" to 1 million, which suggests that there could be negative consequences as well.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or factors that could contribute to lifting Americans out of poverty. It solely focuses on raising the minimum wage as the solution, without acknowledging other potential factors or policies that could also have an impact."}
