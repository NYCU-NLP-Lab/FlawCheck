{"Understate": "The claim understates the impact of the lame-duck actions on the governor and attorney general by stating that \"no power was taken away.\" The expert argues that the bills changed the balance of power and gave more control to the GOP-held Legislature.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up its assertion that no power was taken away. The expert provides evidence from Republican leaders and the changes made by the lame-duck bills to question this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the powers of the governor and attorney general were not affected by the lame-duck actions. The expert argues that this is a narrow and technical view and that power and oversight are generally a zero-sum game.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert presents an alternative explanation by providing evidence from Republican leaders who openly stated that the lame-duck actions were taken to maintain a balance of power and protect the state. This contrasts with the claim that no power was taken away."}
