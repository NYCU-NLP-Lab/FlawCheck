{"Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that they were unable to locate the original source of the video. This lack of information may suggest that there is not enough evidence to fully support the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that cockroaches on guitars appear to be a somewhat common problem, and there are several message boards discussing this issue. This suggests that there could be alternative explanations for the guitar strumming noises in the video, such as the presence of a cockroach but not necessarily producing the musical tones.", "Problematic assumption": "The expert's verdict assumes that because there are other videos of cockroaches producing music on guitars, the claim that the video in question shows a guitar-strumming cockroach is true. This assumption may be problematic as it does not directly prove the claim, but rather provides examples of similar occurrences.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict states that they have no reason to doubt the authenticity of the video, but also mentions that they were unable to locate the original source. This contradiction suggests that the verdict may falter at times in its assessment of the claim.", "Understate": "There is no clear evidence of any bias of understating in the expert's verdict.", "Exaggerate": "There is no clear evidence of any bias of exaggeration in the expert's verdict.", "Contradict fact": "There is no clear evidence of any bias of contradicting fact in the expert's verdict."}
