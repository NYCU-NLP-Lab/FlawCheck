{"Lack enough support": "The expert mentions that there is no evidence or marketing material supporting the claim that Gatorade bottles were designed with a built-in cap holder. They also mention that they examined various patents covering the design of the Gatorade bottle and found no mention of an underside lid holder.", "Problematic assumption": "The expert assumes that the viral image showing a cap held in the bottom of a Gatorade bottle was altered or not genuine.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert suggests that the supposed design feature may vary in different parts of the world and that Gatorade did not intentionally design the bottom of their bottles to hold caps."}
