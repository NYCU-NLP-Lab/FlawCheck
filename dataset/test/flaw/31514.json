{"Exaggerate": "The claim made by Bernie Sanders that the United States spends \"almost twice as much per capita on health care as do the people of any other country\" is an exaggeration. The data from the OECD shows that while the United States does spend more than other countries, it is not consistently twice as much.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific data or evidence to back up the assertion that the United States spends almost twice as much per capita on healthcare compared to any other country.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that higher per capita spending on healthcare is an indicator of better healthcare outcomes or quality. This assumption is not necessarily accurate as there are other factors that contribute to healthcare outcomes.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the differences in healthcare spending between the United States and other countries. Factors such as differences in healthcare systems, population demographics, and the cost of medical treatments could all contribute to variations in spending."}
