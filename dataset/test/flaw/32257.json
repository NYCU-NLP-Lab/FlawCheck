{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the cost of the health care plan by stating that it will cost a minimum of about $15,000 per family per year. This is not supported by the expert's analysis of the plan.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the government will penalize citizens if they choose not to buy a health care plan. While it is true that the plan requires everyone to buy insurance or face a tax penalty, the claim assumes that the penalty will be harsh and that citizens will be penalized for not buying a plan that costs $15,000 per family per year.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide enough evidence or support for the statement that the government will penalize citizens for not buying a health care plan that costs $15,000 per family per year. The expert's analysis does not support this claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the penalties or requirements in the health care plan. The expert's analysis explains that the penalties and jail terms mentioned by Sarah Palin are not part of the health care bill, but rather tools used by the IRS against tax cheats."}
