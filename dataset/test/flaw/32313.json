Allen West in the 2012 election. This assumption may not be accurate as other factors, such as candidate popularity and voter sentiment, can also play a role.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the fundraising success, such as the candidate's personal connections or fundraising strategies."}
