{"Lack enough support": "The claim that burning bay leaves decreases anxiety is not supported by sufficient evidence. The expert points out that the study cited by the claim actually concluded that linalool does not have a strong anti-anxiety effect.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the presence of linalool in bay leaves automatically translates to a decrease in anxiety when burned. However, the expert highlights that linalool is also found in other aromatic plants and its effects on anxiety are still being researched.", "Falters at times": "The expert criticizes the selection of the study by the claim's source, stating that it appears to have been a superficial and incomplete review of the scientific literature. This suggests that the claim may not have been thoroughly researched.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the study cited actually found that linalool can decrease motor function and produce unconsciousness, but does not have a strong anti-anxiety effect. This contradicts the claim's assertion that burning bay leaves reduces anxiety.", "Exaggerate": "The claim describes the effect of smelling a burning bay leaf as \"mildly psychedelic.\" This could be seen as an exaggeration, as there is no scientific evidence to support such a claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert suggests that there are alternative studies that could have been selected to support a connection between linalool and anxiety. This implies that the claim may have overlooked other research that could provide a different explanation."}
