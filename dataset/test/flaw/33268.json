{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the situation by stating that troops surrounded the opposition leader's home, implying a large-scale operation. However, there is no evidence of any police raid taking place.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence or mention of the alleged incident by the opposition leader himself or his party. The image used in the claim is also at least four years old and unrelated to the current situation.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there is no evidence of any police raid taking place and that the image used is not related to the current incident.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the opposition leader's home was surrounded by troops and that evidence was planted on his property, without any factual basis or evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation could be that the opposition leader and his party are denying any involvement in the reported attacks and accusing the president of trying to silence the opposition. This alternative explanation challenges the claim's narrative of the opposition leader's home being surrounded by troops."}
