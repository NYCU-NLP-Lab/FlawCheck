{"Understate": "The claim exaggerates the role of frozen wind turbines in the Texas power outages, while the expert's verdict states that wind turbine shutdowns accounted for only a fraction of the loss of electricity and power generation.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that frozen wind turbines played a major role in the power outages, as the expert's verdict states that failures of thermal power generators were responsible for the majority of the shutdowns.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that frozen wind turbines were the main culprit for the power outages, while the expert's verdict highlights that the power generating infrastructure in Texas was not adequately prepared for the rare winter storm.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the power outages, such as the failures of thermal power generators (natural gas, coal, and nuclear power) which were responsible for the majority of the shutdowns, as stated in the expert's verdict."}
