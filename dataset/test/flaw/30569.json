{"Understate": "The claim may understate the impact of the House GOP rules package on the Congressional Budget Office's ability to analyze the cost of repealing the Affordable Care Act. The expert's verdict suggests that if true, this provision would be significant, but it does not provide a definitive conclusion on whether the claim is accurate.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support as the expert's verdict only provides an analysis of the rules package and does not explicitly confirm or refute the claim. The verdict mentions a provision that seemed to prevent the CBO from analyzing the cost of ACA repeal, but it does not provide concrete evidence or further analysis.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim may make a problematic assumption that the House GOP rules package bars the CBO from counting spikes in deficit spending spurred by an ACA repeal. The expert's verdict highlights the provision that seemed to prevent the CBO from analyzing the cost of repeal, but it does not definitively state that it bars the CBO from counting spikes in deficit spending.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may exist alternative explanations for the provision in the House GOP rules package. The expert's verdict mentions that the provision established a new requirement for the CBO to undertake a long-term analysis for legislation and specifically freed the ACA repeal from this type of analysis. This suggests that there could be alternative reasons for the provision, such as streamlining the legislative process or addressing concerns about long-term budget projections."}
