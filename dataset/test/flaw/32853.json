{"Exaggerate": "The claim that the real Hillary Clinton has been dead since 1998 and was replaced with a clone is an extreme and exaggerated statement.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or credible sources to support the assertion that Hillary Clinton has been dead since 1998 and replaced with a clone.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that human cloning technology existed in 1998 and that fully-mature adult clones can be created in just three days, which is not supported by scientific evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides alternative explanations for the rumors surrounding Hillary Clinton's health, such as her pneumonia diagnosis, rather than attributing them to her being a clone."}
