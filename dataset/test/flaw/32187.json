{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the impact of President Obama's plan to cut waste by stating that it won't actually save money because it will be spent elsewhere. The expert's verdict suggests that this may be an exaggeration by providing examples of how saving money in one area can be used for other necessary expenses.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support to back up the assertion that President Obama's plan won't save money. The expert's verdict provides additional information and perspectives to support the idea that the claim is not well-supported.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that any money saved in one area will automatically be spent elsewhere, without considering the possibility of reallocating funds to more necessary expenses. The expert's verdict challenges this assumption by providing examples of how saving money can be used for different purposes.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim suggests that President Obama's plan won't save money because it will be spent elsewhere. However, the expert's verdict presents an alternative explanation that cutting waste in one area can be used for other necessary expenses, challenging the claim's assertion."}
