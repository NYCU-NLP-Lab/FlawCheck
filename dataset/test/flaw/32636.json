{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating by using the word \"refused\" to describe the White House's handling of international help. The expert's verdict suggests that there were offers of assistance that may have been accepted by BP or the Coast Guard, but the claim implies that the White House outright refused all international help.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to fully verify whether the White House refused international help or not. The expert's verdict provides some information from the State Department spokesperson, but it does not provide a definitive answer.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the handling of international help, such as BP accepting assistance directly or the Coast Guard making decisions on behalf of the government. This implies that the claim may not consider these alternative explanations and instead jumps to the conclusion of refusal by the White House."}
