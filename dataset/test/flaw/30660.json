{"Exaggerate": "The claim of \"ballot curing is fraud\" may be seen as an exaggeration because it implies that all instances of ballot curing are fraudulent, without providing sufficient evidence to support this assertion.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific examples or evidence of fraudulent activities related to ballot curing. It relies on anecdotal social media posts and unsubstantiated claims of widespread voter fraud.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the practice of ballot curing is solely a Democratic attempt to \"steal\" the election, without considering alternative explanations or the bipartisan nature of ballot curing.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the practice of ballot curing, such as ensuring that eligible voters' ballots are counted and addressing issues like missing signatures or discrepancies.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that ballot curing is a legal process in many states, including Georgia, where voters are given an opportunity to correct their rejected mail-in ballots by providing identification and an affidavit confirming the ballot is theirs.", "Understate": "There is no clear understatement bias present in the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by relying on social media posts and unsubstantiated claims rather than providing comprehensive and verifiable evidence to support the assertion that ballot curing is fraud."}
