{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the provisional ballots labeled as \"duplicate\" were not rejected but counted.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the situation by using the term \"bombshell numbers\" and implying that a vast amount of provisional ballots were rejected, when in reality, only 1,638 out of 1,994 were duplicate ballots.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or specific numbers to back up the assertion that a vast amount of provisional ballots were rejected for being duplicate.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the rejection of duplicate ballots is a significant issue or irregularity, without providing any context or comparison to previous elections.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the alternative explanation that the duplicate ballots were a result of eligible voters going to the wrong precinct, rather than intentional rejection."}
