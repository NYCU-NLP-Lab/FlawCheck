{"Lack enough support": "The claim that indoor workers get \"less UV than outdoor workers, but they get more melanomas\" lacks sufficient evidence or supporting data to back it up.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that there is a direct causal relationship between UV exposure and melanoma, without considering other factors that may contribute to the development of the disease.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to acknowledge that there may be alternative explanations for why indoor workers have higher rates of melanoma, such as genetic predispositions or other occupational hazards."}
