{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent of the deductions taken by Hillary Clinton's friends, Warren Buffett and George Soros, by using terms like \"massive\" without providing specific evidence or comparison.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough specific evidence or support to substantiate the deductions taken by Hillary Clinton's friends.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the deductions taken by Warren Buffett and George Soros were similar to the deductions claimed by Donald Trump, without providing clear evidence or comparison.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the deductions taken by Warren Buffett and George Soros, such as the fact that Buffett's deduction was claimed by his business and not his personal taxes, and that Soros' deductions would not appear on his personal tax returns due to being from his hedge funds."}
