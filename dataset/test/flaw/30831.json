{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or reliable sources to support the assertion that penguins fall over onto their backs while trying to observe airplanes flying overhead. The expert's verdict mentions that there is not much reason to believe the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that penguins fall over onto their backs while observing airplanes, which is a questionable assumption without proper evidence.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict contradicts the claim by stating that penguins hate the sound made by airplanes and scatter whenever one approaches. This contradicts the idea that penguins would calmly crane their necks to watch airplanes fly overhead.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for the behavior of penguins, suggesting that they scatter when airplanes approach due to their dislike of the sound. This alternative explanation challenges the claim that penguins fall over onto their backs while observing airplanes.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential harm or disruption caused to the penguins by the airplanes flying overhead. The expert's verdict mentions that penguins scatter when airplanes approach, indicating that there may be more significant consequences than just falling over onto their backs.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the behavior of penguins by suggesting that all penguins fall over onto their backs when observing airplanes. The expert's verdict mentions that penguins scatter, but it does not support the claim that all penguins fall over.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times by presenting a story that has been embellished and modified over time, as mentioned in the expert's verdict. This suggests that the claim may not accurately represent the original observations or experiences."}
