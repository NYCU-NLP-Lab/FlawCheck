{"Contradict fact": "The claim that none of the dropped ministers made it to court contradicts the fact that former transport cabinet secretary Michael Kamau and former lands minister Charity Ngilu were charged and taken to court.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or specific examples to back up the assertion that the allegations against the dropped ministers had no basis.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the allegations made against the dropped ministers were baseless without providing any evidence or justification for this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the alternative explanation that the dropped ministers may not have been taken to court for reasons other than the lack of basis for the allegations, such as successful legal challenges or other legal processes.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by incorrectly stating that none of the dropped ministers were charged in court when there are documented cases of charges and court appearances for some of them."}
