{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the amount of waste generated by Nigeria by stating that it is over 62 million tonnes a year. The expert's verdict provides information on waste generation per person and per day, which suggests that the total waste generation might be lower than the claimed amount.", "Lack enough support": "The claim is not supported by any specific data or sources. The expert's verdict mentions the estimated waste generation per person and per day but does not provide specific evidence for the total waste generation of over 62 million tonnes.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the waste generation in Nigeria is over 62 million tonnes a year without providing any evidence or explanation for this assumption. The expert's verdict does not address this assumption directly.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict does not provide any alternative explanation or conflicting information regarding the claim."}
