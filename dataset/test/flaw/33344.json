{"Lack enough support": "The claim made by Seth Moulton that \"The VA negotiates prescription drug prices. Medicare doesn't do that\" lacks sufficient support. The expert's verdict states that Moulton's spokesperson cited a paper from 2011, but it does not provide any further evidence or recent data to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that negotiating prescription drug prices is the only factor that determines the cost difference between the VA and Medicare. The expert's verdict explains that the VA uses a different system to establish drug prices and also benefits from a law that caps the amount patients pay for prescriptions. This suggests that there may be other factors at play besides negotiation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict highlights that Medicare delegates the job of negotiating drug prices to private Medicare (Part D) drug plans, which leads to variations in drug prices across plans. This suggests that there is an alternative explanation for the difference in prescription drug prices between the VA and Medicare.", "Understate": "The claim made by Moulton may understate the complexity of the issue by simply stating that \"The VA negotiates prescription drug prices. Medicare doesn't do that.\" The expert's verdict explains that both the VA and Medicare have different systems and approaches to establishing drug prices, indicating that the issue is more nuanced than the claim suggests.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Medicare does delegate the negotiation of drug prices to private Medicare (Part D) drug plans, as stated by the expert's verdict. This indicates that the claim is not entirely accurate.", "Falters at times": "The claim made by Moulton falters at times because it oversimplifies the differences between the VA and Medicare in terms of negotiating prescription drug prices. The expert's verdict highlights the complexities and variations in drug prices across plans within Medicare, suggesting that the claim does not fully capture the nuances of the issue.", "Exaggerate": "There is no clear evidence of exaggeration in the claim or the expert's verdict."}
