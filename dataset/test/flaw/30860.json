{"Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific evidence or data to support the assertion that Nigeria's population exceeds 200 million.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as an exaggeration if the actual population is lower than 200 million.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the challenges faced by Nigeria are directly related to its population exceeding 200 million, without providing further explanation or evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the challenges faced by Nigeria, such as economic factors, political instability, or social issues, that are not addressed in the claim."}
