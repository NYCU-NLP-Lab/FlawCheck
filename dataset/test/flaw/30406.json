{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the percentage of climate scientists who do not agree with the idea that 95 percent of climate change is caused by CO2. The actual percentage is not specified, but it is likely lower than 57 percent.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide enough support or evidence for the stated percentage of climate scientists who disagree with the idea that CO2 is the main cause of climate change.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the survey mentioned is representative of all climate scientists, which may not be the case.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to acknowledge that there are other greenhouse gases, such as methane and nitrous oxide, that also contribute to climate change. It simplifies the issue by solely focusing on CO2."}
