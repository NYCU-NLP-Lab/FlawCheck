{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating by stating that every time the Legislature suspended the kicker, Salem spent every penny and failed to stabilize the state's revenues. The expert's analysis shows that the kicker has only been suspended three times since its approval in 1979, and there was a one-time suspension in 2007 to start a \"rainy day fund.\"", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to substantiate the assertion that every penny was spent and the state's revenues were not stabilized. The expert's analysis provides some information about the suspension of the kicker, but it does not provide a comprehensive analysis of the impact on state revenues or how the money was spent.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that suspending the kicker is the reason for the failure to stabilize the state's revenues. However, the expert's analysis does not provide sufficient evidence to support this assumption or explore alternative explanations for the state's revenue stability.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's analysis suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the state's revenue stability, such as the impact of economic factors on income taxes. However, the claim does not acknowledge or consider these alternative explanations.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the kicker has been suspended three times since its approval in 1979. The claim implies that every time the Legislature suspended the kicker, which includes the most recent corporate kicker in 2007, Salem spent every penny. However, the expert's analysis shows that there were periods when the kicker was left alone, and there was a one-time suspension to start a rainy day fund."}
