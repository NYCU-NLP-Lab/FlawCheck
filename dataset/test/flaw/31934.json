{"Understate": "The claim may understate the impact of Abrams' leadership in preventing the use of ACT/SAT testing standards in the 2011 HOPE bill. The expert's verdict mentions that Abrams fought to prevent certain cuts and ensure the bill included funding for remedial classes and a low-interest loan program, but it does not provide specific evidence or data on the extent of her efforts in preventing the use of testing standards.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to fully evaluate the extent of Abrams' role in preventing the use of ACT/SAT testing standards. The expert's verdict mentions that there is no hard data on the discussions that took place behind closed doors, making it difficult to determine the exact level of Abrams' involvement in this aspect of the bill.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the use of ACT/SAT testing standards would have harmed poor students and students of color. While the expert's verdict mentions that such tests would have disproportionately disqualified low-income students and students of color, it does not provide concrete evidence or data to support this assumption. It is important to critically evaluate the potential impact of testing standards on different student populations.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the inclusion or exclusion of ACT/SAT testing standards in the 2011 HOPE bill. The expert's verdict mentions that the original Republican proposal sought to impose testing requirements to narrow eligibility, but it does not explore other potential reasons or motivations behind the decision to retain an eligibility tier without testing requirements."}
