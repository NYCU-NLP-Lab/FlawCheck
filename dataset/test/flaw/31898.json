{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of health care bills on small businesses by stating that 62% of small businesses over the last five years went under because they couldn't pay their health care bills. The actual statistic is related to personal bankruptcies in 2007, not small business closures.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as the actual statistic provided by the expert contradicts the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the closure of small businesses is solely due to their inability to pay health care bills, without considering other factors that may contribute to business closures.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by misrepresenting the statistic and using incorrect terminology (referring to personal bankruptcies as small businesses).", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for small business closures, such as economic factors, competition, or mismanagement."}
