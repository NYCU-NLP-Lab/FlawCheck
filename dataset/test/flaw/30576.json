{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or sources to support the assertion that President Obama encouraged schools to teach the Quran for extra credit. The rumor is based on anonymous emails and text-only updates on social media, which do not provide credible support for the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that President Obama encouraged schools to teach the Quran for extra credit, while at the same time restricting discussion of the Bible, God, prayer, or saluting the American Flag. However, there is no evidence provided to support this assumption, and it may be based on unfounded beliefs or biases.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the controversy in La Plata, Maryland, was not about studying the Quran for extra credit but rather a parent's objection to a curriculum covering world religions. The claim falsely connects unrelated incidents and distorts the actual issue.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the situation by presenting it as a widespread encouragement from President Obama to teach the Quran for extra credit in schools. The lack of credible sources and the reliance on anonymous emails and social media updates indicate an exaggeration of the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in terms of its credibility and reliability due to its reliance on anonymous sources, lack of evidence, and contradictory information. It does not provide a consistent and well-supported argument.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation could be that the claim is a result of misinformation or a misinterpretation of events. The lack of credible sources and the contradictory information suggest that there may be alternative explanations for the claim."}
