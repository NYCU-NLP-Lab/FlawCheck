{"Lack enough support": "The claim that the FEMA drill was purposely scheduled to disrupt access to the California primary is not supported by any evidence or facts.

The expert's verdict states that the start date of the drill was the same as the primary, but it was conducted in Idaho, Oregon, and Washington, not California.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the potential impact of the FEMA drill on the California primary, as it is based on rumors and speculation on social media rather than concrete evidence."}
