{"Exaggerate": "The claim suggests that \"tens of billions of dollars\" flowed directly from AIG to foreign corporations and banks, which may be an exaggeration as it does not provide specific evidence or figures to support this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or specific details to support the assertion that taxpayer-funded bailouts flowed directly to foreign corporations and banks. It does not provide specific examples or sources to back up this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the flow of money from AIG to foreign corporations and banks is inherently problematic or outrageous. It does not consider the reasons behind these payments, such as contractual obligations or the global nature of AIG's operations.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert provides an alternative explanation for the flow of money to foreign corporations and banks, stating that it was necessary to honor contractual obligations and prevent AIG from going bankrupt. This suggests that there may be alternative reasons for the payments, which the claim does not acknowledge.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that AIG had contractual obligations with both U.S. and foreign firms, which it could not meet without the bailout funds. The claim implies that the money should have been exclusively directed towards U.S. companies, ignoring these contractual obligations.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential consequences of AIG going bankrupt, as the expert mentions that it would have had a catastrophic effect on the U.S. and global economies. The claim does not acknowledge the potential systemic risks that were being mitigated through the bailout.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter by not acknowledging the reasons behind the flow of money to foreign corporations and banks, and by not providing sufficient evidence or specific details to support its assertion."}
