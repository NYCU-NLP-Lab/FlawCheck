{"Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that precipitation in smoky areas following a wildfire is likely to be extremely toxic without providing sufficient evidence or explanation for this assumption.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support or evidence to substantiate the assertion that rainfall in smoky areas after a wildfire is toxic.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert suggests that there could be alternative explanations for the perceived toxicity of rain in smoky areas, such as the conflation with acid rain or the containment of toxin-containing particulate matter in raindrops, but these explanations are lacking in evidence.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that acid rain is primarily caused by the emission of sulfur dioxide from burning fossil fuels, not from wildfires.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential danger or toxicity of rain in smoky areas following a wildfire by using the phrase \"extremely toxic\" without providing sufficient evidence or support.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not providing a clear explanation of how the rain in smoky areas becomes toxic or poses a danger to humans or pets.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the level of toxicity or danger associated with rainfall in smoky areas following a wildfire without sufficient evidence or support."}
