{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Wisconsin has not counted more votes than it has registered voters.", "Understate": "The claim understates the number of registered voters in Wisconsin by using the outdated number from 2018.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or sources for the numbers mentioned.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of registered voters from 2018 is still accurate for the 2020 election, which is a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the alternative explanation that the number of registered voters may have increased since 2018, leading to a discrepancy between the two figures."}
