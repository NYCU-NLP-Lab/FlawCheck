{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered exaggerated as it states that there are 390 million guns on the streets, while the most recent estimate from the Small Arms Survey is 393 million civilian firearms holdings in the United States, including those owned by the military and law enforcement agencies.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific sources or data to back up the figure of 390 million guns. However, the Small Arms Survey report is cited as a source for the figure of 393 million firearms.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of guns on the streets is equal to the total number of guns in the country. It does not take into account guns that are not in circulation or are not accessible to the general public.", "Exist alternative explanation": "While the claim suggests that the number of guns on the streets is a problem, it does not consider alternative explanations for the high number of guns, such as legal gun ownership, historical factors, or cultural attitudes towards firearms.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the most recent estimate from the Small Arms Survey is 393 million civilian firearms holdings, which is slightly higher than the claimed figure of 390 million guns.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times as it relies on estimates and reports from different sources, which may have variations in their data collection methods and accuracy."}
