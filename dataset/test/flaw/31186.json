{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of fielders outside the circle when MS Dhoni was run out. The expert's verdict confirms that there were indeed six fielders outside the inner circle, as shown in the misleading post. However, it is important to note that the field was changed just before the ball was delivered, which is not mentioned in the claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only provides a screenshot and a caption from the match without any further evidence or analysis. The expert's verdict, on the other hand, provides detailed information, analysis, and footage to refute the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that MS Dhoni was run out on an illegal ball due to the number of fielders outside the circle. However, the expert's verdict confirms that New Zealand had the permitted number of fielders outside the circle when Dhoni was run out. Therefore, the assumption made in the claim is problematic.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider the alternative explanation that the field was changed just before the ball was delivered, which could have influenced the run-out. The expert's verdict highlights this alternative explanation, providing evidence from the footage reviewed.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that New Zealand had the permitted number of fielders outside the circle when Dhoni was run out. The expert's verdict confirms this fact based on the footage reviewed and analysis.", "Falters at times": "It is difficult to determine if the claim falters at times without further context or specific information."}
