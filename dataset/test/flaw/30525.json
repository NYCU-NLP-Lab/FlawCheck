{"Exaggerate": "The claim \"We never had an earthquake in Youngstown until John Kasich was elected Governor\" exaggerates the impact of John Kasich's election on the occurrence of earthquakes in Youngstown. The expert's verdict states that there have been minor seismic activities prior to Kasich's tenure as governor.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the occurrence of minor seismic activities in Youngstown before John Kasich became governor. The expert's verdict mentions that there have been \"10 smaller earthquakes\" in the Youngstown area in the 10 months preceding the New Year's Eve earthquake.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on the personal interpretation of a map of earthquakes in Ohio produced by the Ohio Department of Natural Resources (ODNR). The expert's verdict mentions that the monitoring equipment for seismic events in Youngstown was only put in place in 1999, and the ODNR's record of historical earthquakes relies on other monitoring systems and newspaper reports.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the occurrence of earthquakes in Youngstown is directly linked to John Kasich becoming the governor. The expert's verdict does not provide evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the occurrence of earthquakes in Youngstown, such as natural geological factors or other human activities. The expert's verdict does not mention any alternative explanations either."}
