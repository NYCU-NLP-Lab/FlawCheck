However, there is no direct evidence or official confirmation to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation is that the claim is based on misinformation or misunderstanding. The KDCA spokesperson and Celltrion both state that Celltrion is not developing or producing Covid-19 vaccines, suggesting that the claim may be inaccurate or misinformed."}
