{"Falters at times": "The claim falters at times because it does not take into account the specific circumstances and economic conditions surrounding each minimum wage increase.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide sufficient evidence or data to back up the assertion that every time the minimum wage is raised, the number of jobless people increases.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that there is a direct causal relationship between raising the minimum wage and an increase in joblessness, without considering other factors that may contribute to changes in employment levels.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the observed changes in joblessness, such as the impact of recessions or recoveries, which cast doubt on the claim's assertion.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there have been instances where joblessness actually decreased after a minimum wage increase, indicating that the claim is not universally true.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the impact of minimum wage increases on joblessness by stating that it happens every time, without acknowledging the instances where joblessness actually decreased.", "Understate": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim understates any aspect of the issue."}
