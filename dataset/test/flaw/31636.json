{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerated as it states that the reserves are in \"much better shape\" than they were just a few years ago without providing specific data or comparisons.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or data to back up the statement that the reserves have improved significantly.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in property values and projected revenue will automatically result in improved reserves, without considering other factors that may affect the financial situation of the county.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times as it mentions the county's struggle financially and the concerns raised by bond rating agencies about the depleted reserves, indicating that the improvement may not be as significant as claimed.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the increase in reserves, such as changes in budgeting or financial management practices, which are not addressed in the claim."}
