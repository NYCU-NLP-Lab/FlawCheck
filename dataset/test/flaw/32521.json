{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the presence and involvement of Khalistan supporters at Rahul Gandhi's event in the UK. The video shows a small group of protesters who managed to gatecrash the event, but the claim portrays it as if all Khalistan supporters were invited and actively participated in the event.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement in the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim does not provide any information that suggests it falters at times.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it relies solely on a video showing a small group of protesters and does not provide any additional evidence to support the claim that Khalistan supporters were invited to the event.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the presence of a few Khalistan supporters at the event represents the views and intentions of the entire Congress party. This assumption is problematic as it generalizes the actions of a few individuals to the entire party.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the presence of Khalistan supporters at the event, such as their ability to gatecrash due to a lapse in security."}
