{"Exaggerate": "The claim that Gov. Scott Walker is denying Democrats the right to vote may be seen as an exaggeration because it implies a deliberate and intentional effort to suppress Democratic voters.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the voter ID law signed by Gov. Walker disproportionately affects Democratic voters without providing sufficient evidence to support this assumption.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to substantiate the accusation that Gov. Walker is intentionally denying Democrats the right to vote. The evidence provided only suggests that the voter ID law may have a potential impact on certain groups that tend to vote Democratic.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the voter ID law, such as the intention to prevent voter fraud or ensure the integrity of the election process."}
