{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the role of fentanyl and synthetic drugs coming across the southern border as the \"bulk of the problem\" with the opioid epidemic.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that the majority of the problem with the opioid epidemic is due to fentanyl and synthetic drugs coming across the southern border.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the assumption that securing the southern border will solve the opioid epidemic without providing evidence or considering alternative factors contributing to the crisis.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert points out that while drugs can enter from the southern border, they also come in through other points of entry, suggesting that there are alternative explanations for the opioid epidemic beyond the southern border."}
