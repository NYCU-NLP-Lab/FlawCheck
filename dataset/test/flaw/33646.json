{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the role of the \"pay as you go\" principle in transforming large deficits into surpluses in the 1990s. The expert's verdict suggests that while it was a factor, it was not as important as other forces such as the increase in tax receipts from the booming economy and defense cuts.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support to fully credit the \"pay as you go\" principle for the surpluses in the 1990s. The expert's verdict mentions a range of opinions on how much the rule helped, indicating a lack of consensus.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the \"pay as you go\" principle was the main factor in transforming deficits into surpluses, without considering other significant factors such as the increase in tax receipts and defense cuts.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that while the \"pay as you go\" principle was a factor, there were other forces at play, such as the increase in tax receipts from the booming economy and defense cuts, which may provide alternative explanations for the transformation of deficits into surpluses in the 1990s."}
