The claim does not provide enough evidence to support this assertion.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide enough evidence or specific details to support the statement that Marcy Kaptur voted against a ban on gender-selection abortion.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Marcy Kaptur's vote against the bill was solely based on the reason that the baby girl was being aborted because of her gender. This assumption is not explicitly supported by the information provided.", "Alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider any alternative explanations for Marcy Kaptur's vote against the ban on gender-selection abortion. It does not explore other potential reasons or factors that might have influenced her decision."}
