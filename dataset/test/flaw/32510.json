The expert's verdict provides information from the local police, who state that the man was making objectionable gestures and obscene comments towards minor girls.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the man is Hindu, not Muslim. The expert's verdict provides evidence from the local police and news sources that confirm the man's Hindu identity.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the alternative explanation that the man was engaged in inappropriate behavior towards minors, rather than attempting to rape a five-year-old girl.
