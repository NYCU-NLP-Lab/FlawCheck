{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates Missouri's position as \"#1 in the nation\" for holding down tuition increases at public universities. While Missouri does have the lowest tuition increase among the 50 states, it is not the absolute leader when considering all states, districts, and territories included in the data.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the statement. The only provided evidence is a study by the College Board, which shows Missouri having the lowest tuition increase among the 50 states. However, it does not provide a comprehensive analysis of all factors and alternative explanations.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that holding down tuition increases is the sole indicator of being \"#1 in the nation.\" It fails to consider other factors such as the affordability of tuition or the overall quality of education provided by public universities in Missouri.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Missouri's low tuition increases, such as the impact of state funding or other external factors. It solely attributes the achievement to Missouri's efforts.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Puerto Rico has actually kept tuition increases in check more than Missouri, with a change of 4.7 percent. This information is not mentioned in the claim.", "Understate": "The claim understates the importance of considering average tuition and fees in determining the affordability of education. Missouri ranks 22nd in terms of average tuition and fees, which indicates that there are other states with lower average costs."}
