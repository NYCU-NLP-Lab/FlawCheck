{"Exaggerate": "The claim suggests that the longstanding whistleblower rules were changed just before the submission of the fake whistleblower report, implying a deliberate and recent alteration to enable the report.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the changes in the whistleblower rules were made with the intention of facilitating the submission of a fake report, without providing sufficient evidence to support this assumption.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough concrete evidence or specific details to support the assertion that the rules were changed specifically before the submission of the fake whistleblower report.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the changes in the whistleblower rules, such as routine updates or adjustments unrelated to the specific whistleblower report mentioned.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity and history of the whistleblower rules by implying that they have remained unchanged for a long time, when in fact, modifications and updates to these rules have occurred over time.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that first-hand knowledge by a whistleblower has never been required since the law protecting intelligence community whistleblowers was enacted. It suggests that the recent changes in the rules removed this requirement, which is not accurate."}
