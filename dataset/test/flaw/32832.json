{"Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that there are different numbers and discrepancies in the data regarding the number of countries that have abandoned wealth tax. This lack of consistent and accurate data can be seen as a lack of enough support for the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the abandonment of wealth tax by certain countries is evidence that it is not effective or successful. However, the expert's verdict highlights that there are different definitions and variations in wealth taxes, making it difficult to draw a direct conclusion about their effectiveness based solely on the number of countries that have abandoned it.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the definitions of wealth tax vary, and some countries have replaced broad wealth taxes with narrower ones focused on specific assets. This suggests that there could be alternative explanations for the abandonment of wealth tax by certain countries, such as changes in tax policies or shifts in focus towards specific asset taxation.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict points out discrepancies in the data and a lack of consistent definitions and measurements for wealth tax. This suggests that the claim may falter at times due to the unreliable and inconsistent nature of the available information.", "Understate": "The claim states that 10 out of 14 wealthy OECD countries with a wealth tax in 1996 have abandoned it. However, the expert's verdict mentions that the actual count in 1996 was either 12 or 13, indicating that the claim may understate the number of countries that have abandoned wealth tax.", "Exaggerate": "The claim presents a clear and definitive number (10 out of 14) for the countries that have abandoned wealth tax. However, the expert's verdict highlights discrepancies in the data and variations in definitions, suggesting that the claim may exaggerate the certainty and accuracy of its statement.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim is slightly off in terms of the actual count of countries with wealth tax in 1996. This indicates that the claim contradicts the factually accurate count of countries at that time."}
