{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent to which Mayor Giuliani made New York City a \"sanctuary city\" and allowed illegal aliens to come.", "Understate": "The claim understates the fact that the policy of not reporting suspected illegal immigrants to federal authorities is based on the belief that it encourages undocumented immigrants to report crimes and seek medical care.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that Mayor Giuliani instructed the leaders of the city not to enforce immigration law.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Mayor Giuliani's actions were solely responsible for making New York City a \"sanctuary city,\" disregarding the fact that immigration enforcement is primarily a federal obligation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to acknowledge that the term \"sanctuary city\" is often used by opponents of illegal immigration to convey broader protection than the actual policies provide."}
