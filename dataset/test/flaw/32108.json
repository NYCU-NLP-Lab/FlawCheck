{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the size of the manta ray by referring to it as a \"giant\" and stating that it weighed between five and six thousand pounds.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the significance of the photograph by implying that it is a genuine capture of the manta ray, while the expert's verdict clarifies that it is a taxidermy version.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or sources to support the assertion that the photograph shows a manta ray caught in 1933."}
