{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the difference in loudness between seismic airgun blasting and a conventional airhorn by stating that it is \"16,000 times louder.\" The expert's verdict reveals that the actual difference in decibel levels ranges from 19,000 to 10 million times more intense.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that seismic airgun blasting is 16,000 times louder than an airhorn. The expert's verdict provides more accurate information about the decibel levels but does not support the specific claim made.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that loudness is a measurable quantity that applies across species. The expert's verdict states that loudness is more a matter of human perception and that marine biologists use decibels to compare sound levels.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for measuring sound levels by using decibels instead of loudness. This challenges the assumption made in the claim.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that seismic airgun blasting is not actually 16,000 times louder than an airhorn, as stated. The expert's verdict provides more accurate information about the decibel levels emitted by seismic arrays.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in the provided claim or the expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "There is no evidence of the claim or the expert's verdict faltering at times bias in the provided information."}
