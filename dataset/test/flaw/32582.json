{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent of people in Lucknow celebrating eco-friendly Bakrid by cutting cakes instead of sacrificing goats. The expert's verdict suggests that the claim is misleading and may not accurately represent the overall sentiment or behavior of the Muslim community in Lucknow.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to validate the assertion that people in Lucknow celebrated eco-friendly Bakrid by cutting cakes instead of sacrificing goats. The expert's verdict questions the accuracy and representation of the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the celebration of eco-friendly Bakrid by cutting cakes instead of sacrificing goats is a widespread practice among the Muslim community in Lucknow. The expert's verdict suggests that this assumption is misleading and may not reflect the reality.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict presents an alternative explanation by highlighting the involvement of the RSS-affiliate Muslim Rashtriya Manch in promoting the cutting of cakes with goat caricatures to celebrate Eid-ul-Adha. This suggests that the celebration may be influenced by a specific organization rather than being a widespread practice among the Muslim community in Lucknow."}
