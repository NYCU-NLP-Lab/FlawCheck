{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the number of states in which Team Trump has accused Ted Cruz of fraud. The expert's verdict mentions that the pro-Trump post explicitly names Cruz as the beneficiary (and possible miscreant) only in Texas, Kansas, and Maine, while the claim includes additional states without clear evidence.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or sources to back up the accusation of fraud in all the mentioned states.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the accusations made by Team Trump against Ted Cruz are valid and accurate without providing sufficient evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that there could be alternative explanations for the accusations of fraud, such as voting irregularities or misleading mailers, which may not necessarily indicate intentional fraud committed by Ted Cruz.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times by making broad accusations without providing specific details or evidence for each state mentioned.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the extent of the accusations made by Team Trump against Ted Cruz, as the expert's verdict suggests that there are additional states being investigated for potential fraud by the Trump Ballot Security Project.", "Contradict fact": "There is no clear evidence to confirm or contradict the claim that Team Trump has accused Ted Cruz of fraud in all the mentioned states. The expert's verdict raises doubts about the validity and extent of these accusations."}
