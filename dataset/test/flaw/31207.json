{"Exaggerate": "The claim states that \"\u2018Dark money\u2019 spending\" in the 2016 election cycle \"is 10 times what it was at the same point in the 2012 election cycle.\" This could be an exaggeration if the data does not support such a significant increase in spending.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific evidence or data to support the statement that dark money spending is 10 times higher in the 2016 election cycle compared to the same point in the 2012 election cycle. It relies on a statement made by U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin without providing further evidence or sources.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that an increase in dark money spending is inherently problematic or dangerous, without providing a clear explanation or evidence for why this is the case.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim attributes the increase in dark money spending to conservative groups backed by individuals such as Karl Rove and the Koch brothers. This suggests a bias towards attributing the increase to specific political ideologies or actors, without considering other potential factors or motivations for increased spending."}
