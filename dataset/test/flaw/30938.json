{"Lack enough support": "The claim is based on photos and a caption from a Facebook post, but it does not provide any additional evidence or sources to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the photos show a Pakistani doctor being attacked by the family of a heart patient who died due to a COVID-19 misdiagnosis. This assumption may not be supported by sufficient evidence.", "Contradict fact": "If there is evidence or information that contradicts the claim, it could be considered a bias. However, this is not evident from the provided information.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is a conflicting report that states the doctor was injured by a mentally ill police officer in a different incident. This alternative explanation may suggest a bias in the claim if it fails to acknowledge or consider this information."}
