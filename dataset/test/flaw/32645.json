{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates Gillibrand's role in protecting, defending, and harboring a sitting president who had sexual relations in the Oval Office and was impeached for lying.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Gillibrand protected, defended, and harbored President Clinton without providing enough evidence to support this assumption.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that Gillibrand publicly defended President Clinton while he was in office.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation that Gillibrand's work on legislation to curb sexual assault in the military and on college campuses does not necessarily mean she defended President Clinton's actions."}
