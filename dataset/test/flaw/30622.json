{"Exaggerate": "The claim falsely states that SEIU was caught hiding 39 million N95 masks, when in reality the union had called medical suppliers nationwide in an effort to find masks and never had or hid them.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks evidence or support to prove that SEIU was hiding the masks.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the union's announcement of finding a supplier with 39 million masks is suspiciously timed in relation to Attorney General William Barr's announcement about pursuing cases against hoarders, even though there is no evidence of a connection between the two.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim suggests an alternative explanation by insinuating that the union had the masks to begin with and was hiding them, which is not supported by any evidence."}
