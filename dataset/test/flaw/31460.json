{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the situation by stating that the girl was forced to marry a much older man who raped her. The expert's verdict clarifies that the story referenced in the claim took place decades earlier and the accompanying photograph was not related to the forced child marriage.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the girl was forced to marry and was raped. The expert's verdict mentions that the story was shared in an opinion piece and does not provide substantial evidence.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the girl was forced to marry solely based on the information provided. The expert's verdict suggests that the decision to marry her off to her rapist was made to avoid a messy criminal case, but it does not explicitly state that she was forced.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions alternative explanations, such as the story being used as a means to criticize child marriages in the Muslim world while ignoring Christian child marriages in the United States. This implies that there may be alternative motives behind sharing the story.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the accompanying photograph does not represent the forced child marriage described in the story. The expert's verdict clarifies that the photograph was from a YouTube \"social experiment\" and not related to the actual event.", "Understate": "There is no clear indication of any bias of understating in the claim or the expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "There is no clear indication of any bias of faltering at times in the claim or the expert's verdict."}
