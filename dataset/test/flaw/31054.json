{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the dropout rate by stating that one in three Texas children drop out of high school. The expert's verdict mentions that the attrition rate for the class of 2009 was 31 percent, which is slightly lower than one in three.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim is based on the attrition rate calculated by the nonprofit Intercultural Development Research Association (IDRA). While the IDRA has tracked high-school completion rates for over 20 years, it may be argued that more comprehensive data and research are needed to fully support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all students who do not graduate are dropouts, but the expert's verdict mentions that graduation rates involve different data. This assumption may oversimplify the issue of dropout rates.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that dropout rates are a complicated subject and that different measurements and methods can yield varying results. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations or interpretations of the dropout rates in Texas.", "Falters at times": "The claim may be seen as faltering at times due to the complexity and variability of measuring dropout rates. The expert's verdict highlights the confusion and different definitions of dropout rates, indicating that the claim may not provide a comprehensive understanding of the issue.", "Understate": "It is not mentioned in the expert's verdict whether the claim understates the dropout rate. Without further information, it is difficult to determine if this bias exists in the claim.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict does not explicitly mention any contradictions with facts in the claim. However, it does mention the complexity and variability of measuring dropout rates, which may suggest that the claim could be contradicted by alternative data or interpretations."}
