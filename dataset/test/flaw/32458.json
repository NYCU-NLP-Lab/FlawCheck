{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the order by stating that all ballots must be counted by 8 p.m. on the day of the election, which is not accurate.", "Understate": "The claim understates the actual ruling by a federal judge, which extends the period for counting absentee ballots by nearly a week.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks support as it does not provide the name of the judge who supposedly issued the ruling.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the order is in line with President Trump's demand for an early call of a winner on election night, which may not necessarily be true.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider the alternative explanation that the ruling actually extends the time for counting absentee ballots to ensure a more accurate and inclusive counting process."}
