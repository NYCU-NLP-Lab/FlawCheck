{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent of Bill White's alleged failure to pay taxes by stating that he \"didn't pay taxes\" while earning his salary as deputy secretary of energy. The expert's verdict suggests that there is insufficient evidence to independently prove or disprove this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no access to Bill White's relevant tax return, which would provide the necessary information to verify the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Bill White did not pay federal income taxes in 1995 based on the information provided by Perry's campaign. However, this assumption is not supported by concrete evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation provided by White's campaign spokeswoman, who stated that White had withholding and paid income tax for the period he served in the federal government. This alternative explanation challenges the claim that White did not pay taxes.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that White reported \"no taxable income for 1995\" according to information from his campaign and the Dallas Morning News article. This suggests that there may be conflicting information regarding White's tax obligations in 1995.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times as there is ambiguity regarding the specific taxes being referred to. The expert's verdict suggests that Perry's campaign did not specify the type of taxes, leaving room for interpretation.", "Understate": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim understates any information or downplays the severity of the alleged tax evasion."}
