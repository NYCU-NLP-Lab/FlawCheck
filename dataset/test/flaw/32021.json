{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent to which only one county, Dane, is hand counting the votes in the 2016 presidential recount. The expert's verdict mentions that the majority of Wisconsin's 72 counties, including Dane, are conducting the recount by hand.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the assertion that only one county, Dane, is hand counting the votes in the recount. The expert's verdict provides information about the recount process in Wisconsin but does not specifically address the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that hand counting votes is a significant factor in the recount process, suggesting that it may be more accurate or reliable than other methods. However, the expert's verdict does not provide any information to support or refute this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the possibility that other counties in Wisconsin may also be hand counting votes in the recount. The expert's verdict mentions that the majority of counties, including Dane, are conducting the recount by hand, suggesting that there may be alternative explanations to the claim."}
