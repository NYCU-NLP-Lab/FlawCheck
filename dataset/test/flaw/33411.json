{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a study mentioned by the author, but there is no direct evidence or citation provided to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that millimeter wave body scanners commonly used by airport security can alter DNA based on the study mentioned. However, this assumption is not well-supported or proven.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for any observed effects on DNA mentioned in the study, such as other factors or variables that were not considered. The claim does not acknowledge or discuss these alternative explanations.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential risks or limitations of millimeter wave body scanners by focusing only on the potential DNA alteration aspect and not considering other potential health risks or concerns.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times in terms of providing a clear and well-supported argument. The expert's verdict highlights that the author of the claim has no professional background in biology or physics, which may raise doubts about the credibility and accuracy of the claim.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the potential effects of millimeter wave body scanners by stating that they can \"alter your DNA\" without sufficient evidence or scientific consensus to support such a strong claim.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts established scientific knowledge and consensus by suggesting that millimeter wave body scanners can alter DNA. The expert's verdict mentions that terahertz photons from these scanners are not energetic enough to break chemical bonds or ionize atoms or molecules, which contradicts the claim's assertion."}
