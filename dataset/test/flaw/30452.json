{"Exaggerate": "The claim that surface temperatures on Earth have \"stabilized\" is an exaggeration, according to the expert's verdict. The reality is that temperatures will rise again, sooner or later.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support because even though surface temperatures have shown a pause in their increase over the past 16 or 17 years, it does not mean they have stabilized.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that the pause in surface temperature increase means that the situation has stabilized, which is not supported by scientific consensus.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by stating that the pause in temperature increase is not indicative of stabilization but rather a temporary slowdown in global warming.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by using the word \"stabilized\" to describe the pause in surface temperature increase, which is not supported by scientific evidence.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that surface temperatures on Earth have not actually stabilized, as confirmed by climate specialists and experts.", "Understate": "The claim understates the reality of the situation by suggesting that surface temperatures have stabilized when they have not."}
