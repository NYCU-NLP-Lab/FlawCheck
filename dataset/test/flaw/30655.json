{"Exaggerate": "The claim of \"every poll\" saying that the speaker won the debate may be an exaggeration, as there is evidence of at least one poll that contradicts this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific evidence or data to support the assertion that \"every poll\" said the speaker won the debate.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that polls are the only measure of debate performance, without considering other factors or alternative explanations for the results.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the possibility that different polls may have different methodologies or sample sizes, which could lead to varying results."}
