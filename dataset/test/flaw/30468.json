{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the existence of a 'Harry Potter Dementor' figure above a shopping center in Zambia. The only evidence provided is a witness account and two photographs, which are deemed unconvincing.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the figure photographed is a 'Harry Potter Dementor' without providing substantial evidence to support this assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict contradicts the claim by stating that the figure in the photographs is actually a kite that was digitally added to the image.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of the photographs by suggesting that locals ran away in fear, believing the figure to be a manifestation of God, while others stayed to worship it. There is no substantial evidence to support these exaggerated claims.", "Understate": "There is no understatement bias present in the claim or the expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in terms of providing accurate information as it misrepresents the figure in the photographs as a 'Harry Potter Dementor' rather than a kite.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for the photographs, stating that the figure is a kite designed by Martin Lester."}
