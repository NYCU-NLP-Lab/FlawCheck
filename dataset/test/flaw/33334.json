{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that President Trump plans to bypass the swearing-in ceremony of his successor. The reports mentioned in the expert's verdict are based on unnamed sources and have not been confirmed by any official statements from Trump or his team.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that President Trump's tweet about not attending the inauguration is a confirmation of his plans to bypass the ceremony. However, the tweet does not explicitly mention his intentions for January 20th or address earlier reports of hosting a rally on that day.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for President Trump's tweet and his decision not to attend the inauguration. It is possible that he may have other commitments or reasons for not attending the ceremony, which are not mentioned in the provided information.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing a clear and definitive answer regarding President Trump's plans. The expert's verdict states that for weeks, there was uncertainty about whether Trump would bypass the inauguration ceremony, and the tweet only confirms his decision not to attend without addressing other aspects.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the uncertainty and lack of confirmation surrounding President Trump's plans. The expert's verdict mentions that the reports were not confirmed by a member of Trump's team or the president himself, and the White House did not respond to inquiries about the reports.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not contradict any known facts, as it is based on the information provided in the expert's verdict. However, it is important to note that the claim itself is not fully supported by concrete evidence.", "Exaggerate": "The claim does not appear to exaggerate any information or make any exaggerated statements."}
