{"Lack enough support": "The claim that the silent version of The Poseidon Adventure was being screened aboard the Titanic at the moment it hit the iceberg lacks sufficient evidence or specific details to support it.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the screening of a film about a sinking ocean liner during the Titanic's voyage is a remarkable coincidence, without providing any evidence or logical reasoning to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the presence of the film aboard the Titanic, such as it being a common practice at the time for luxury ocean liners to carry their own projectors and films for entertainment purposes.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing a clear connection between the timing of the Titanic hitting the iceberg and the screening of The Poseidon Adventure. It does not establish a causal relationship or explain how the two events are related.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the significance of the coincidence by stating that it is \"much lesser known\" and has received \"relatively little attention.\" This could be an exaggeration or subjective statement without sufficient evidence.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance of the coincidence by presenting it as \"no less remarkable\" than the coincidence of the novella Futility and the sinking of the Titanic. This could be an attempt to create a sense of intrigue or fascination without providing substantial evidence.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not contradict any established facts, but it does not provide enough evidence to support its own claim either."}
