{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to conclusively prove that the bone fragments found in the Vatican belong to the two missing teen girls from 1983. The DNA testing on the bone fragments has not been completed yet, which adds to the lack of support for the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the bone fragments found in the Vatican are linked to the missing girls from 1983 without concrete evidence. This assumption may be problematic as it is based on speculation and speculation alone.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the bone fragments found in the Vatican. It focuses solely on the possibility that they belong to the missing girls, without exploring other potential sources or origins of the fragments.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that DNA testing on the bone fragments has not been completed yet. Without the results of the DNA testing, it is premature to make a definitive statement about the origin or identity of the fragments.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the complexity and uncertainty surrounding the identification of the bone fragments. It does not acknowledge the challenges or limitations in establishing a conclusive link between the fragments and the missing girls.", "Exaggerate": "There is no evidence of exaggeration in the claim. The information provided is based on the reported discoveries of bone fragments in the Vatican and the historical context of the missing girls.", "Falters at times": "The claim does not falter at times. It presents the available information and speculations surrounding the bone fragments found in the Vatican and their potential connection to the missing girls."}
