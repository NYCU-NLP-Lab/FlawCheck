{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the cost of illegal immigration by stating that the United States loses \"250 Billion Dollars a year,\" which is not supported by available data.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that the United States loses $250 billion a year on illegal immigration.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that a border wall would effectively prevent illegal immigration and subsequently save the United States money, which is a contentious and debatable assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There are alternative explanations and estimates provided by experts, such as the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), which estimates the cost of illegal immigration to be around $116 billion a year, significantly lower than the claim made.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the available data and estimates provided by immigration experts, who state that there is limited data on the cost of illegal immigration and that the largest estimate found is not even half of the claim's assertion.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the complexity and nuances of the issue of illegal immigration by simplifying it to a single cost figure and suggesting that a border wall would solve the problem.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in terms of accuracy and reliability, as it is not supported by credible data or expert consensus."}
