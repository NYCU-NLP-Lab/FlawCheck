{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that the video shows an actual \"pink volcano\" erupting in New Zealand, when in fact it is a digitally created video by an artist.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that the video depicts a real volcanic eruption.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the pink smoke in the video is a result of a chemical process, without providing any evidence or explanation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict explains that the pink smoke in the video is not a result of a volcanic eruption, but rather a creation by an artist. This presents an alternative explanation to the claim."}
