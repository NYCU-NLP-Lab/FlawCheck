{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the susceptibility of Pyrex brand glass bakeware to breakage by stating that it is \"now more susceptible to breakage.\" The expert's verdict clarifies that all glass bakeware is subject to breakage due to thermal shock, not just Pyrex.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement in the provided claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim does not appear to falter at times.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or data to support the assertion that Pyrex brand glass bakeware is more susceptible to breakage.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the change in material used for Pyrex bakeware is the reason for the perceived increase in breakage. However, the expert's verdict suggests that the breakage is primarily due to the nature of glass and thermal shock, rather than the change in material.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the breakage of Pyrex brand glass bakeware.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Pyrex glass bakeware was originally made from borosilicate glass and is now made from tempered soda lime glass. The expert's verdict confirms this change in material."}
