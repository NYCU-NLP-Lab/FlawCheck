{"Understate": "The claim may understate the role of the state in property taxes by stating that it has \"nothing to do\" with them. The expert's verdict mentions that the state mandates certain programs without providing financial support, indicating some level of involvement in property taxes.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that property taxes are solely controlled by local governments and have no connection to the state. However, the expert's verdict highlights the state's influence on local government finances and service delivery, suggesting that there is a connection.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the assertion that property taxes have \"nothing to do with the state.\" The expert's verdict mentions the state's role in mandating programs without providing financial support, but it does not provide extensive evidence to refute the claim entirely.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests an alternative explanation to the claim by highlighting the state's influence on local government finances and service delivery. This implies that the state does have some involvement in property taxes, contradicting the claim."}
