{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the level of support for a border wall in 2006 by stating that \"they\" (referring to Obama, Schumer, and Clinton) all voted for it. While they did vote in favor of the Secure Fence Act of 2006, which authorized a fence along certain stretches of the border, this is not the same as the wall that Trump is proposing.", "Understate": "The claim understates the differences between the fence authorized in 2006 and Trump's wall proposal. The fence was described as having \"rust-colored thick bars\" and \"teeth-like slats\" that were 18 feet high, with miles of gaps and openings. Trump's wall proposal, on the other hand, is described as being made of precast concrete, rising 35 to 40 feet, or even higher.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that because Obama, Schumer, and Clinton voted for the 2006 fence, they should also support Trump's wall. However, it is possible for individuals to support a fence but not a wall, as there are differences in cost, design, and effectiveness between the two.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to fully justify the assertion that Democrats are now playing politics just because Trump is in office. While it is true that some Democrats voted for the 2006 fence, it does not necessarily mean that their opposition to Trump's wall is solely based on politics. There may be other reasons, such as concerns about cost, effectiveness, or environmental impact.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why Democrats may be opposed to Trump's wall. It assumes that their opposition is solely based on politics, without considering other factors such as policy disagreements, concerns about immigration enforcement tactics, or prioritization of other issues.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the 2006 fence authorized by the Secure Fence Act is not the same as the wall Trump is proposing. The claim implies that the fence and the wall are interchangeable, when in reality there are significant differences in design, cost, and scope."}
