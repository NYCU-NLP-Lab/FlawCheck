{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the amount of contraband confiscated by the Coast Guard. The expert's verdict states that the Coast Guard removed 223.8 metric tons of cocaine, not 200 tons of contraband overall.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or specific data to support the statement that the Coast Guard confiscated 200 tons of contraband and 20 tons at the border.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in accurately representing the types of drugs confiscated by the Coast Guard. The expert's verdict mentions that the claim mistakenly refers to heroin instead of cocaine.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that funding the Coast Guard is the most effective way to address the problem of drug smuggling and border security, without providing evidence or considering alternative solutions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the difference in the amount of contraband confiscated by the Coast Guard and at the border. It solely focuses on the need to fund the Coast Guard."}
