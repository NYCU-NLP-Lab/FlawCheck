{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the United States \"decided waterboarding was torture\" based on the court-martial of American soldiers during the Philippine revolution. While there is evidence of waterboarding being used during that time, it does not directly prove that the United States officially declared it as torture.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the court-martial of American soldiers for waterboarding Philippine insurgents during the Philippine revolution indicates a decision by the United States that waterboarding is torture. However, this assumption may overlook other possible reasons for the court-martial, such as violations of military conduct or rules of engagement.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in presenting a clear and concise argument. It jumps between different historical examples and does not provide a cohesive narrative to support the assertion that the United States decided waterboarding was torture.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the court-martial of American soldiers for waterboarding Philippine insurgents during the Philippine revolution. It is possible that the court-martial was based on violations of military conduct or other charges, rather than a definitive decision that waterboarding is torture.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the United States officially declared waterboarding as torture. While the claim presents historical instances where waterboarding was condemned or prosecuted, it does not prove that the United States as a whole made an official decision on the matter.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance of the court-martial of American soldiers during the Philippine revolution in determining the United States' stance on waterboarding as torture. It presents these historical examples as definitive proof, without considering other factors or contexts."}
