{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no formal certification process or list of \"Mother-Friendly\" certified hospitals provided by the Coalition for Improving Maternity Services.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the principles of Mother-Friendly care are being implemented by the unit based on the mention of the Coalition for Improving Maternity Services, without providing concrete evidence or certification.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be other hospitals or units in the state that also strive to implement the principles of Mother-Friendly care, but they are not mentioned in the claim."}
