{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent to which the Obama administration supported Muslim allies in establishing a new international blasphemy standard. The expert's verdict suggests that the administration's support was limited to endorsing a resolution aimed at promoting religious tolerance, rather than actively advocating for the establishment of a new standard.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the opposition and efforts made by the United States and Western European representatives to prevent the establishment of blasphemy laws at the United Nations. The expert's verdict highlights that these representatives opposed such moves on free speech grounds but were out-voted.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack sufficient evidence or support to conclusively prove that the Obama administration supported Muslim allies in establishing a new international blasphemy standard. The expert's verdict raises questions about the level of support and provides a more nuanced perspective on the administration's actions.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim may make the problematic assumption that the Obama administration's support for a resolution promoting religious tolerance equates to actively supporting the establishment of a new blasphemy standard. The expert's verdict suggests that the resolution aimed at finding common ground for religious tolerance, rather than endorsing a specific standard.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim may not consider alternative explanations for the actions of the Obama administration. The expert's verdict highlights that the administration's support for the resolution could be seen as an effort to promote religious tolerance and respect for human rights, rather than directly supporting the establishment of a new standard."}
