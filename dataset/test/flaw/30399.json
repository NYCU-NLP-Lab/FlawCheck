{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that milkshakes containing cement were thrown during the protests. No evidence was provided by the police or any other source to substantiate the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the milkshakes thrown during the protests contained cement based on a single observation by a police lieutenant, without any further verification or evidence.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in terms of providing consistent and reliable information. The police initially made the statement about cement-containing milkshakes, but later city officials admitted that it was based solely on the observation of a police lieutenant.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that no evidence was provided to support the assertion of milkshakes containing cement being thrown during the protests.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the impact and spread of the rumor, as it suggests that the rumor went \"completely off the rails\" and evolved from cement to acid being added to the milkshakes.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not provide an alternative explanation for the observed powdery substance or the irritation caused by the milkshakes, other than the assumption of cement being added."}
