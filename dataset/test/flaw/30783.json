{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of polluted cities in India and China. The expert's verdict states that there are 13 cities in India, not 15 as claimed.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or sources to back up the statement.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of polluted cities in India and China is relevant to the climate change debate, which may be a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that particulate pollution, which is the focus of the claim, is not a key contributor to climate change. This implies that there may be alternative explanations for climate change that are not addressed in the claim."}
