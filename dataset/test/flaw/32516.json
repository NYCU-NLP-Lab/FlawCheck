{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that police have officially approved a series of steps to avoid criminal charges when breaking a window to save a dog or baby from a hot car.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence provided to back up the assertion that police have officially approved these specific actions.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that following the suggested steps will guarantee immunity from criminal charges, which is a problematic assumption as it is not supported by official police statements.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider the alternative explanation provided by police departments that breaking into a car may still result in criminal damage charges, regardless of the circumstances."}
