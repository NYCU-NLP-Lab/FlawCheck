{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support because there is no universally accepted definition of mass shootings, and different sources have different criteria for counting them. Additionally, there is no U.S. government entity specifically tracking mass shootings and the race/ethnicity of the shooters.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the statistic of white men being responsible for 54% of mass shootings since 1982 is accurate and reliable. However, this statistic is based on data from a specific database (Mother Jones) that has its own criteria for defining mass shootings.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the higher number of mass shootings by white men. It does not explore potential socioeconomic, cultural, or psychological factors that may contribute to this trend.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there is no universally accepted definition of mass shootings, and different sources may have different criteria for counting them. This makes it difficult to make definitive statements about the demographics of mass shooters.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by relying on data from specific sources (such as Mother Jones) without acknowledging the limitations or potential biases of those sources.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity and multifactorial nature of mass shootings by reducing it to a single factor (race/ethnicity). It does not consider other potential contributing factors such as mental health issues, access to firearms, or societal factors.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance of the statistic that white men have committed more mass shootings than any other group. This statistic is based on a specific database (Mother Jones) and may not be representative of the entire population of mass shootings."}
