{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that the photos show a Rafale fighter jet crashed during training in India in September 2020. The provided evidence suggests that the photos are actually from a previous incident involving a Mirage 2000 jet.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the photos depict a recent incident involving a Rafale fighter jet, without considering the possibility that they may be unrelated or from a different event.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the photos are actually from a previous incident involving a Mirage 2000 jet, as evidenced by the reverse image search and comparison with reports from Indian news outlets.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation exists, which is that the photos are not related to a Rafale fighter jet crash in September 2020, but rather from a previous incident involving a Mirage 2000 jet.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the significance of the evidence that suggests the photos are from a different incident involving a Mirage 2000 jet, rather than a Rafale fighter jet crash.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in accurately identifying the aircraft depicted in the photos, as it mistakenly attributes them to a Rafale fighter jet crash instead of a Mirage 2000 jet crash.", "Exaggerate": "There is no evidence of exaggeration in the claim, as it does not appear to embellish the severity or impact of the alleged Rafale fighter jet crash."}
