{"Understate": "The claim may understate the current requirements for background checks in Virginia by stating that non-federally licensed dealers cannot get a background check even if they want one. This is contradicted by the fact that the governor is backing legislation to broaden background checks and allow state police to conduct voluntary checks on private sales.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or data to back up the assertion that non-federally licensed dealers cannot get a background check.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the assumption that non-federally licensed dealers are prohibited by law from conducting background checks, which is disputed by the ad taken out by Everytown for Gun Safety that states \"voluntary background checks already exist\" for private sellers.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the claim, such as the interpretation of the current law and the potential loopholes that allow for casual sales between individuals without background checks."}
