{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance of the Gallup poll by presenting it as a recent and groundbreaking finding, when in reality it is a question that has been asked since 1965 and the 72 percent figure is a record high for that specific wording.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to fully back up the assertion that big government is the biggest threat to the nation's security. It only provides the statistic from one poll without considering other factors or alternative explanations.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Gallup poll accurately represents the views of all Americans and Democrats, without considering potential biases or limitations in the survey methodology.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the respondents' choice of big government as the biggest threat. It does not explore other possible factors or reasons behind this perception."}
