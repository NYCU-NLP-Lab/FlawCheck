{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the increase in Obamacare premiums by stating that they have increased by \"double and triple digits\" without providing specific evidence or context for these figures.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that Obamacare premiums have increased significantly.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in premiums is solely due to the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) without considering other factors such as rising healthcare costs or changes in provider networks.", "Understate": "The claim understates the fact that premium increases vary across different states and that the average increase of 25 percent is higher than previous years but not necessarily \"skyrocketing\" as implied.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to acknowledge alternative explanations for premium increases, such as the short-term correction of underpricing in the early years of the health care law.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that premiums actually decreased in Indiana in 2017, which undermines the assertion that premiums have universally increased.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by selectively focusing on premium increases on the federal insurance exchange and not considering the overall impact of the Affordable Care Act on healthcare access and affordability."}
