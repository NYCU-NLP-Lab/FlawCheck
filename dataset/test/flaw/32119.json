{"Exaggerate": "The claim that the San Domenico school removed \"more than 160 statues\" is false, according to the expert's verdict. The school spokesperson clarified that only six out of sixteen statues were removed.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understating bias in the provided claim.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that the reports don't clearly explain the school's ethos and strategic planning, which may lack enough support for the decision to remove the statues.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the removal of the statues is solely for the purpose of being more inclusive. The expert's verdict points out that the decision is less surprising when considering the school's status as an independent Catholic school.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that the decision to remove the statues may have been influenced by the school's status as an independent Catholic school, rather than solely for inclusivity reasons. This indicates the existence of alternative explanations for the removal."}
