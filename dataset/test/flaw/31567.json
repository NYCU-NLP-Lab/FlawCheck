{"Lack enough support": "The claim that Johnson & Johnson \"admitted\" that their baby products contain formaldehyde lacks enough support. The provided information only mentions that the Indian FDA ruled on a case in which batches of Johnson & Johnson baby powder were found to have been sterilized with ethylene oxide, but it does not directly state that the company admitted to the presence of formaldehyde.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the cancellation of Johnson & Johnson India's license to produce cosmetics at its Mulund plant means that all Johnson & Johnson baby products contain formaldehyde. This is a problematic assumption as it does not provide evidence or information directly linking the cancellation of the license to the presence of formaldehyde in all their baby products.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the cancellation of Johnson & Johnson India's license, such as failure to conduct mandatory tests or concerns over the use of ethylene oxide for sterilization. The claim does not consider these alternative explanations and jumps to the conclusion that it is solely due to the presence of formaldehyde."}
