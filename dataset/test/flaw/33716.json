{"Contradict fact": "The claim that triple antibiotic ointment swabbed inside nostrils can prevent flu contagion contradicts the expert's verdict, which states that none of the three antibiotics in the ointment have any impact on the influenza virus.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as there is no scientific evidence or research provided to back up the effectiveness of using triple antibiotic ointment to prevent flu contagion.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that applying the ointment inside the nostrils can create a protective layer and prevent the flu, but this assumption is not supported by scientific evidence or expert opinion.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by stating that viruses like the influenza virus can enter and infect cells throughout the respiratory system, making the application of ointment inside the nostrils ineffective in preventing flu contagion.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the effectiveness of triple antibiotic ointment by suggesting it can prevent flu contagion, even though the expert's verdict clearly states that the ointment is used to treat skin infections and has no impact on the influenza virus.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement in this case.", "Falters at times": "There is no evidence of the claim faltering at times in this case."}
