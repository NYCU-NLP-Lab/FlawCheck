{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as an exaggeration since there is no concrete evidence or widespread reports to support the idea that people are actually licking toilets as a form of protest against President Trump. The claim is based on a meme that has circulated on certain online platforms.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no substantial evidence or credible sources provided to validate the assertion that people are engaging in this specific form of protest.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the meme circulating on online platforms accurately represents the actions and motivations of liberal critics of President Trump. However, this assumption may be problematic as memes often involve satire, irony, or hyperbole and may not reflect actual behavior or beliefs.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation could be that the meme about licking toilets is simply a joke or a form of online trolling rather than a genuine form of protest. The claim does not consider this possibility, suggesting a bias towards a particular interpretation.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there is no substantial evidence or widespread reports to support the idea that people are actually licking toilets as a form of protest against President Trump. The claim presents this assertion as if it were a well-known and established phenomenon, which is not the case.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by presenting information from a former writer for Snopes without providing any context or relevance to the topic. This inclusion may be seen as an attempt to lend credibility to the claim without offering any substantive evidence.", "Understate": "There is no apparent understatement bias in the claim."}
