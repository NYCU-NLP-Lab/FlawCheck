{"Exaggerate": "The claim of \"rioting now\" over sanctuary cities in California is an exaggeration as there is no evidence or reports of widespread riots.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to substantiate the assertion of riots occurring in California over sanctuary cities.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that any discontent or opposition towards sanctuary cities automatically translates into riots, which is a problematic assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there is no broad consensus on the question of whether sanctuary cities are good policy, indicating that not everyone in California opposes them, let alone riots over them.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the discontent or opposition towards sanctuary cities, such as peaceful protests or legal challenges."}
