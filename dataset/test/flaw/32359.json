{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the increase in violent crime during President Obama's tenure, as experts have stated that crime rates remain at a historic low.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient data and evidence to support the assertion that neighborhoods have become more violent under President Obama's watch.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes a direct causation between President Obama's presidency and the increase in violent crime, without considering other factors that may contribute to crime rates.", "Exist alternative explanation": "Experts have pointed out that the increase in violent crime rates in the first six months of 2015 may not be directly attributed to President Obama's presidency, as there are longer-term trends showing a decrease in crime rates."}
