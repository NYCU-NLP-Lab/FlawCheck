{"Understates": "The claim may understate the amount of money that comes from employers for union-operated worker training centers. The expert's verdict mentions that \"95 percent comes from employers,\" implying that the actual percentage may be higher.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict suggests that the discussion about worker training and who pays for it was confusing and that both sides of the argument failed to address each other's points effectively. This indicates that the claim may falter at times due to a lack of clear communication and understanding.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict does not provide specific evidence or data to support the claim that 95 percent of the money used for union-operated worker training centers comes from employers. Therefore, the claim may lack enough support to be considered fully reliable.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that a right-to-work law would have a significant impact on the funding for worker training. However, the expert's verdict does not provide concrete evidence to support or refute this assumption, making it potentially problematic.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that if workers are no longer required to pay dues to a union, there may be fewer union members and less money available for training. However, it also suggests that the training could be done by taxpayer-supported technical colleges. This alternative explanation challenges the claim that the funding for training centers would be significantly affected by a right-to-work law."}
