{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the number of public officials who have used a private email server similar to Hillary Clinton's. The expert's verdict states that only one other politician, Jeb Bush, is on record as doing the same.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the assertion that there is a \"tremendous\" number of public officials who have used a private email server like Clinton.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that because one politician, Jeb Bush, used a private server, there must be a large number of others who have done the same. However, this assumption is not supported by evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by stating that while many politicians use private email addresses, private servers like Clinton's are rarely seen. This suggests that Clinton's use of a private server may be less common among public officials than the claim implies."}
