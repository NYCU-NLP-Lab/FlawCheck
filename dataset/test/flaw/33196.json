{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of the video by stating that it is being shared widely on all forms of social media and has been viewed close to a million times. However, this may not necessarily be an intentional bias but rather an attempt to emphasize the video's circulation.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the video is indeed of the funeral procession of the Kathua rape victim. The expert's verdict provides evidence that the video is actually of a different funeral procession in Jabalpur.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video being circulated is of the funeral procession of the Kathua rape victim without verifying its authenticity. This assumption is problematic as it leads to the spread of misinformation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for the video, stating that it is actually of the funeral of Mufti-e-Azam Maulana Ahmed Qadri in Jabalpur. This suggests that the initial claim's assumption about the video's content is incorrect.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the video is not of the funeral procession of the Kathua rape victim but of another individual's funeral in Jabalpur. The expert's verdict presents evidence to debunk the claim.", "Understate": "There is no clear instance of understatement in the claim or the expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not verifying the authenticity of the video before asserting its content. This leads to the spread of misinformation.", "N": "A: The claim and the expert's verdict do not contain any instances of this bias."}
