{"Exaggerate": "The claim may contain elements of exaggeration, as it suggests that Swara Bhasker abused Major Gogoi and the Indian Army based on her tweet.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Bhasker's tweet was referring to the Kashmir \"human shield\" incident, which may not be explicitly stated or confirmed.", "Lack enough support": "It is unclear from the provided information whether Bhasker actually abused Major Gogoi and the Indian Army, as it only mentions that she was attacked on Twitter by individuals who made that assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for Bhasker's tweet, apart from it being an abuse towards Major Gogoi and the Indian Army."}
