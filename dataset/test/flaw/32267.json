{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that President Obama has \"the worst ratings of any president at the end of his first year.\" The expert's verdict clarifies that this statement is an exaggeration and that it should be qualified to state that Obama's numbers were the worst of any post-World War II president at this point in his term.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support or evidence to back up the assertion that President Obama has the worst ratings. The expert's verdict mentions that Gallup's historical data only dates back to Harry Truman, and therefore, a direct comparison with all presidents is not possible.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that ratings at the end of the first year are available, but the expert's verdict points out that those numbers won't be available until late January. Therefore, the claim is based on a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides alternative explanations by comparing the circumstances of different presidents who came to office at different times. It highlights that presidents who assumed office after the death or resignation of their predecessor may have different approval ratings compared to those who were elected.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by making inaccurate statements, such as referring to ratings at the end of the first year when they are not yet available. The expert's verdict points out this flaw in the claim.", "Understate": "There is no clear evidence of understatement in the claim or the expert's verdict.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that President Obama has the worst ratings of any president at the end of his first year. The expert's verdict clarifies that this statement is an exaggeration and provides historical data to support a more accurate comparison."}
