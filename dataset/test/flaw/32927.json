{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or credible sources to support the assertion that the army seized petrol pumps after being refused fuel.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the petrol pumps were seized by the army solely because they refused to provide fuel, without considering other possible reasons for the alleged seizure.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the statement of the supervisor from Bharat Petroleum, Sulthan Bathery, who denied the news and stated that no petrol pumps in Sulthan Bathery refused to provide fuel to the army.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the situation by suggesting that the army seized the petrol pumps as a direct response to being refused fuel, without considering other factors or circumstances.", "Understate": "It is possible that the claim understates the complexity of the situation and the protocol followed during disaster and relief operations, where petrol pumps are directed to set aside reserves for government vehicles."}
