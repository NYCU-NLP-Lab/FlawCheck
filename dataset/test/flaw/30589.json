{"Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that the Greater Rochester Chamber of Commerce was not able to provide information on which economic indicators the claim is referring to. This suggests a lack of enough support for the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that if upstate New York split from downstate, the economic indicators of upstate New York would be among the lowest in the country. This assumption may be problematic as it does not provide evidence or reasoning to support this claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that some upstate advocates were upset over gun control laws and the ban on fracking, as they believed these measures would boost the struggling economy. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the economic indicators of upstate New York, rather than solely depending on downstate.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict states that the statewide unemployment rate in New York is better than the national average and ranks 25th in the nation. This contradicts the claim that upstate's economy would be among the lowest in the country if it split from downstate.", "Understate": "The expert's verdict does not provide an analysis of other economic indicators besides unemployment and wages. This may understate the overall economic situation and potential of upstate New York.", "Exaggerate": "There is no evidence or data provided to support the claim that the economic indicators of upstate New York would be among the lowest in the country if it split from downstate. This suggests that the claim may be an exaggeration without proper justification."}
