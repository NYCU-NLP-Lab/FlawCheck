{"Exaggerate": "The claim of a \"bloodthirsty wolf\" spotted in a Pakistani city in 2021 may be an exaggeration as the expert from the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) identifies the animal in the photo as a Striped Hyena, not a wolf.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the existence of a bloodthirsty wolf in Pakistan. The only evidence provided is a handwritten note and a photo, both of which have been found to be misleading or inaccurate.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the animal in the photo is a wolf without providing any substantial evidence to support this assumption. The expert from the WWF identifies it as a Striped Hyena, suggesting a different species.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The alternative explanation provided by the WWF expert suggests that the animal in the photo is a Striped Hyena, not a wolf. This challenges the claim's assertion of a bloodthirsty wolf in Pakistan.", "Contradict fact": "The official from Pakistan's Forest, Wildlife & Fisheries Department states that no such incident took place in the Bhakkar district, contradicting the claim of a bloodthirsty wolf spotted in that area.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing accurate information as the photos and letter posted on Facebook have been found to be misleading or inaccurate. The claim also relies on unconfirmed reports and circulating photos from previous years.", "Understate": "There is no evident understatement bias in the provided claim."}
