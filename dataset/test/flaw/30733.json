{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of the $1,200 coronavirus relief checks by stating that individuals will automatically owe $1,200 come tax season, which is not true according to the expert's verdict.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that individuals will not owe back the difference or the entire amount of the stimulus payment, as clarified by the expert's verdict.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support or evidence to back up its assertion that the relief checks are just an advance on the next tax return.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that the relief checks are essentially a loan that Americans will have to pay back next year, which is not supported by the expert's verdict.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by stating that the government is implementing a tax cut for 2020 and giving people an advance on what they would have saved, contradicting the claim's assumption."}
