{"Exaggeration": "The claim exaggerates the comparison between the media's approval rate and Congress' approval rate. While it is stated that the media has a lower approval rate than Congress, the extent of the difference is not clearly defined or supported.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the comparison between the media's approval rate and Congress' approval rate. The only support provided is a mention of Gallup's survey from June 2016, which shows negative opinions for both institutions but does not provide a direct comparison of approval rates.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that approval rates are the sole measure of trust or credibility. It does not consider other factors that might influence public perception of the media and Congress.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the difference in approval rates between the media and Congress. It does not explore other factors that might contribute to public perception, such as media bias, partisan attitudes, or specific events impacting trust in Congress."}
