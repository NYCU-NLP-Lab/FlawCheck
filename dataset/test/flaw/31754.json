{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that a study published in the journal Parasites & Vectors observed no serious adverse side effects attributed to Bravecto in a study of 32 beagles.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the dangers of Bravecto by stating that several dogs have died within 30 days due to liver and kidney failure after taking the medication, without providing sufficient evidence to support this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a single anecdotal report from a Facebook post, without any additional evidence or scientific studies to back it up.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Bravecto is dangerous to dogs based on the reported death of one dog and the near-death experience of another dog, without considering other potential factors or underlying health conditions that could have contributed to these incidents.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the reported deaths and adverse reactions, such as other medications or underlying health issues that could have played a role.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by making emotional appeals and personal anecdotes, which may cloud the objective evaluation of the safety of Bravecto.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in the provided claim."}
