However, the expert's verdict provides evidence from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics to support the analysis.", "Problematic assumption": "There is no clear problematic assumption in the claim or the expert's verdict.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is no alternative explanation provided in the claim or the expert's verdict.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact presented by the expert's analysis, which shows that the actual number of construction jobs lost is 81,400, not 50,000 as stated in the claim.", "Falters at times": "There is no evidence of the claim faltering at times or being inconsistent in the information provided."}
