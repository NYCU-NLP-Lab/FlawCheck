{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or data to back up the statement that 13 Texas universities have announced or implemented a $10,000 degree.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the $10,000 degree programs are a direct response to Governor Perry's challenge, without considering other factors or motivations behind the universities' decisions.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the challenges and limitations of the $10,000 degree programs by not fully addressing the additional costs or requirements, such as earning college credit hours elsewhere.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the universities' implementation of $10,000 degree programs, such as the desire to attract more students or compete with other institutions, which are not mentioned in the claim."}
