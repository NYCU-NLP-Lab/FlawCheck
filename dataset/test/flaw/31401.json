{"Understate": "The claim may understate the extent of Florida's ranking in long-term unemployment by only stating that it is \"ranked 2nd in the nation.\" There may be other states with higher rates of long-term unemployment that are not mentioned.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support to fully validate the ranking of Florida as 2nd in the nation for long-term unemployment. The data provided by the Economic Policy Institute may not be the only measure of long-term unemployment, and there may be alternative sources or calculations that could provide different rankings.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Florida's ranking in long-term unemployment is solely attributable to Rick Scott's record on jobs. However, other factors beyond the governor's control, such as national economic trends or policies, could also contribute to the ranking.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for Florida's ranking in long-term unemployment that are not explored in the claim. The claim does not consider other potential factors or policies that could influence long-term unemployment in the state."}
