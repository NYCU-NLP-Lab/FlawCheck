{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the amount added to the national debt by stating that it is an average of $4 billion every day. This may be an inflated figure.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide any specific evidence or data to support the statement that $4 billion is added to the national debt every day. It is not clear how this figure is calculated or where it comes from.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the rising national debt is one of the nation's biggest problems without providing any justification or evidence for this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the national debt or potential factors that may contribute to its growth. It presents the $4 billion figure as the sole cause of the debt increase without exploring other possible factors."}
