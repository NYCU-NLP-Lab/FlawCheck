{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the idea that the results of the Senate and House races are already known, when in reality, mail-in ballots are still being counted in some states.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it fails to provide evidence or data to back up the assertion that the results of the Senate and House races are available.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the results of the Senate and House races should be available at the same time as the presidential race, without considering the differences in counting processes and timelines.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider the alternative explanation that the results of the Senate and House races may take longer to determine due to various factors such as close margins, potential runoffs, or delayed counting processes."}
