{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the comparison between the safety of Covid-19 vaccines and thalidomide by implying that they are equally unsafe.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the rapid development of Covid-19 vaccines automatically makes them unsafe, without considering the rigorous testing and regulatory processes involved.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or scientific data to support the assertion that Covid-19 vaccines are unsafe like thalidomide.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the development process and regulatory requirements for thalidomide were significantly different from those for Covid-19 vaccines.", "Understate": "The claim understates the extensive testing and regulatory requirements that Covid-19 vaccines have undergone, implying that they have not been adequately studied.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert provides an alternative explanation by highlighting the differences in the development and regulatory processes between thalidomide and Covid-19 vaccines."}
