{"Exaggeration": "The claim may be exaggerating the negative effects of marijuana use by suggesting that it leads to extreme acts of violence, such as shooting, stabbing, and strangling others.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide any evidence or data to support the assertion that people on marijuana engage in violent behavior or commit crimes.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes a direct causal link between marijuana use and violent actions, without considering other factors that could contribute to such behavior.", "Alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the behaviors mentioned in the claim, such as underlying mental health issues or other substance use.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts scientific evidence that suggests marijuana use is not a major contributing factor to violent behavior."}
