{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the severity of the attack on Zee News office by using words like \"attacked\" and \"enraged crowd.\" It is unclear from the evidence provided how serious the attack actually was.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough supporting evidence to verify the occurrence of the attack on Zee News office. The only evidence provided is a Facebook post and some photographs, which may not be sufficient to confirm the incident.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the attack on Zee News office was a direct result of insulting the people of Delhi. However, there is no direct evidence linking the attack to the alleged insult.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for the photographs of Sudhir Chaudhary with a nose injury. The evidence suggests that the injury was from an accident in Mumbai, rather than from an attack on Zee News office.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the photographs used as evidence for the attack on Zee News office are actually from different incidents - one from an accident in Mumbai and the other from the ransacking of Mumbai Congress office by MNS workers.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by presenting incomplete or misleading information. For example, it does not provide any information about the credibility or source of the Facebook post, and it only mentions the attack on Zee News office without providing any details about the nature or extent of the attack.", "Understate": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim understates any aspect of the incident."}
