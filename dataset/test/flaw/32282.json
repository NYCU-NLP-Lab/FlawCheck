{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the growth of the federal government payroll by stating that President Obama has grown it by 141,000 workers. While this number is technically true, it fails to mention that much of this growth is a result of policies and budgets implemented by the previous administration under George W. Bush.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or sources to back up the numbers mentioned. It simply references a tweet from Reince Priebus and a Fox News article without providing any further information or data.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the growth in the federal government payroll is solely the responsibility of President Obama. It fails to acknowledge the cyclical nature of federal employment figures and the various factors that contribute to changes in the workforce.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the growth in the federal government payroll, such as the impact of homeland security and defense positions related to fighting wars and terrorism. It solely attributes the increase to President Obama's actions."}
