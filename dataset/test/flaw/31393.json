The expert mentions that no film clip or script has been found documenting the phrase as something spoken by a Wayne character in any movie.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that John Wayne or one of the characters he portrayed said the quoted phrase. However, the expert's verdict states that there is no evidence to support this assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that John Wayne did not actually say the quote, either as a line of character dialogue in a film or speaking as himself. The expert's verdict confirms this.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert provides an alternative explanation for the origin of the quote, attributing it to the character Jackie Brown in the 1973 film \"The Friends of Eddie Coyle,\" based on a novel by George V. Higgins. This suggests that the claim's attribution to John Wayne is incorrect.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate John Wayne's involvement in the quote by attributing it to him or one of the characters he portrayed. The expert's verdict clarifies that there is no evidence to support this attribution.", "Understate": "There is no indication of understatement in the claim or the expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter by not acknowledging the lack of evidence supporting John Wayne's connection to the quote.
