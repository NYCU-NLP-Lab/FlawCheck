{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or data to back up the statement that domestic abusers can easily sidestep the ban on getting a gun.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the \"gun show loophole\" is the main avenue for convicted abusers to obtain guns, without considering other potential ways they could acquire firearms.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the ability of domestic abusers to obtain guns, such as purchasing from private sellers outside of gun shows, which may not be adequately addressed in the claim."}
