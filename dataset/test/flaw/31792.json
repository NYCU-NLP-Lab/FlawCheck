{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent to which rail commuter fares are rising faster than wages. While it is true that regulated rail fares will increase by 3.2% (RPI inflation) in January 2019, the claim does not provide specific data on the rate of wage growth for comparison.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific data or evidence to support the assertion that rail commuter fares are rising faster than wages. It mentions that average wages have increased by 2.4% over the past 12 months, but there is no further information or comparison provided.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in rail commuter fares is solely due to government policy to shift the burden from taxpayers to passengers. While this may be a contributing factor, other factors such as operational costs, infrastructure improvements, and market dynamics could also play a role.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not explore alternative explanations for the increase in rail commuter fares, such as changes in demand, maintenance costs, or investment in rail infrastructure. It solely focuses on the government's policy and the share of funding from passengers and taxpayers.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing a clear and comprehensive analysis of the relationship between rail commuter fares and wages. It mentions various aspects of rail funding and government policy but does not delve into the specific factors driving the disparity between fare increases and wage growth.", "Understate": "The claim does not understate any biases.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not contradict any factual information provided in the expert's verdict."}
