{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the requirement by stating that churches are \"required\" to record and register lists of attendees, implying a strict mandate.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the purpose of recording and registering lists of attendees is solely for tracking purposes, without considering other potential reasons.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or specific details to support the assertion that churches are required to record and register lists of attendees.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the policy, such as public health measures or contact tracing efforts.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the version of the stay-at-home order, which included the requirement, never went into effect.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential impact or implications of the policy by not fully exploring the concerns raised by evangelical groups and commentators."}
