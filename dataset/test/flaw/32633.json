{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that homosexuals are \"not as a group able-bodied\" and \"known to carry extremely high rates of disease brought on because of the nature of their sexual practices.\" While the claim is based on a journal article published by an organization Pence was associated with, it is an exaggeration to generalize these statements to all homosexuals as a group.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support because it does not provide specific evidence or data to back up the assertions made about homosexuals.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption by implying that all homosexuals engage in sexual practices involving degradation or humiliation rarely practiced by heterosexuals. This assumption is not supported by evidence and is based on stereotypes and biases.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation exists in the form of the journal article written by Col. Ronald Ray, which argues against LGBTQ Americans serving in the military. The claim attributes these statements directly to Mike Pence, but it was actually written by someone else and published by an organization he was associated with."}
