{"Exaggeration": "The claim exaggerates by stating that former President Barack Obama \"pardoned a traitor who gave U.S. enemies state secrets, he also pardoned a terrorist who killed Americans.\" This is an exaggeration because neither Chelsea Manning nor Oscar Lopez Rivera were pardoned by Obama, but rather had their sentences commuted.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or examples to back up the assertion that Obama pardoned a traitor who gave U.S. enemies state secrets or a terrorist who killed Americans.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption by equating the commutations of Chelsea Manning and Oscar Lopez Rivera to pardons, which are different legal actions. This assumption leads to a misrepresentation of the facts.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that neither Chelsea Manning nor Oscar Lopez Rivera were pardoned by former President Barack Obama, but rather had their sentences commuted.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by conflating pardons and commutations, as acknowledged by the person making the claim on Twitter. This shows a lack of understanding or confusion about the legal distinction between the two actions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation exists for the claim, which is that Chelsea Manning and Oscar Lopez Rivera had their sentences commuted by Obama, not pardoned. This alternative explanation undermines the assertion made in the claim."}
