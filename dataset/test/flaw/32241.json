{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of the payouts made by the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) by stating that \"billions\" have been paid out for vaccine injuries. The expert's verdict clarifies that this refers to the Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program, not the VICP.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support to demonstrate that the money paid by the VICP means vaccines are unsafe. The expert's verdict provides information from the US Health Resources and Services Administration's Division of Injury Compensation, stating that the US has the safest and most effective vaccine supply in history, with most people experiencing no serious problems from vaccines.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the money paid by the VICP is evidence of vaccine unsafety. However, the expert's verdict explains that being awarded compensation does not necessarily mean the vaccine caused the alleged injury.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the payouts made by the VICP. The expert's verdict mentions that as much as 70 percent of the compensation paid by the VICP is the result of settlements, which may not indicate vaccine unsafety.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the US has the safest and most effective vaccine supply in history, as stated by the US Health Resources and Services Administration's Division of Injury Compensation.", "Understate": "The claim understates the rigorous testing, monitoring, and review processes that vaccines undergo to ensure safety. The expert's verdict mentions that vaccine safety is carefully tested via clinical trials, monitored throughout the manufacturing process, and reviewed after distribution.", "Falters at times": "It is unclear if the claim falters at times, as the provided information does not explicitly mention any inconsistencies or contradictions in the claim."}
