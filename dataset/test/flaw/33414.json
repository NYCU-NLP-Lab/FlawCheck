{"Exaggerate": "The claim of \"Wisconsin found 112k votes at 3am\" exaggerates the situation by implying that the votes were discovered or appeared at that specific time, when in reality they were valid ballots that were received by 8 p.m. on Election Day according to the law.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as the Facebook post and the mention of 112,000 votes are not clearly explained or substantiated.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the \"found\" votes indicate something nefarious or suspicious, which is a problematic assumption as it distorts the election process.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The alternative explanation is that the ballots being counted at 3 a.m. were valid absentee ballots that were received by the deadline and were being processed according to the law.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that no ballots were \"found\" in Wisconsin, as confirmed by a spokesperson for the Wisconsin Elections Commission.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by misrepresenting the counting process and implying wrongdoing when there is no evidence to support such claims.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in this claim."}
