While the company did push for the funds, it did not directly receive a bailout.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that Johnson Controls begged taxpayers for a bailout and received one. The expert's analysis and information provided indicate that the company did push for the funds but did not directly receive a bailout.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Johnson Controls received a bailout when it did not. This assumption is problematic as it contradicts the facts.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation exists for the claim.
