{"Understate": "The claim may understate the homicide rate in Baltimore by comparing it to countries with lower rates, rather than acknowledging that Baltimore's rate is high compared to other cities within the United States.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the comparison between Baltimore's homicide rate and that of other countries or cities.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that comparing a city to an entire country is a valid and meaningful comparison, which experts argue is a flawed assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "Experts argue that comparing crime rates between urban and rural areas would provide a more accurate and meaningful comparison, rather than comparing a city to an entire country."}
