{"Lack enough support": "The claim of a giant 50-foot crab off the coast of Whitstable, UK lacks sufficient evidence or credible sources to support its validity.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict highlights the inconsistencies and doubts surrounding the claim, suggesting that it may falter in terms of its credibility.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the largest crab species in the world, the Japanese spider crab, only grows up to 3.7 meters across, much smaller than the claimed size of Crabzilla.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes the existence of a giant crab based on an aerial photograph, without considering alternative explanations or verifying the authenticity of the image.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the size of the crab, presenting it as a 50-foot creature when the largest known crab species is significantly smaller.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert suggests that the Crabzilla photo is the result of digital manipulation and provides an alternative explanation for the creation of the image using Photoshop and overlaying a crab onto a satellite picture.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in the provided claim."}
