{"Understate": "The claim may understate the impact of the tax levy freeze on property taxes for residents in Westchester County.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that the tax levy has remained flat for seven straight years.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the decrease in county property taxes, such as population growth and the spreading out of the tax levy among more taxpayers.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the property tax levy has remained the same at $548 million annually, rather than being reduced to zero.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the tax levy freeze is solely responsible for the decrease in county property taxes, without considering other factors that may contribute to the overall tax bill."}
