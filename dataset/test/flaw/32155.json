{"Exaggerate": "The claim of Atlanta's population growing from 1 million in the 1970s to almost 7 million today is considered inflated by the expert.", "Lack enough support": "The expert mentions that the claim is complicated and there is confusion about what exactly constitutes Atlanta, indicating a lack of sufficient evidence to support the population growth claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the population growth is solely attributed to Atlanta itself, without considering the inclusion of surrounding areas like Athens and Columbus.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert provides alternative population estimates from different sources, such as the Atlanta Sports Council and the Atlanta Regional Commission, indicating that there are different interpretations and measurements of Atlanta's population."}
