{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered exaggerated as it states that the work done by Bloomberg \"substantially\" reduced the racial achievement gap. The extent of this reduction is not clearly defined or supported with specific evidence.", "Lack enough support": "While the claim is supported by data from the state Department of Education, it would be beneficial to have additional supporting evidence or studies to fully validate the increase in graduation rates and reduction in the racial achievement gap.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in graduation rates and reduction in the racial achievement gap can be solely attributed to the actions taken by Bloomberg during his tenure as mayor. It does not consider other factors or alternative explanations that may have influenced these outcomes.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not explore or acknowledge alternative explanations for the increase in graduation rates and reduction in the racial achievement gap. It attributes these improvements solely to the actions taken by Bloomberg, without considering other potential contributing factors."}
