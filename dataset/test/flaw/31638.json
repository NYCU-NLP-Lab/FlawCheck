{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent of family members working at the White House and other government agencies. The expert's verdict clarifies that only certain family members are employed in top positions.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Trump's daughter is getting Chinese patents and Saudi grants. The expert's verdict explains that Ivanka Trump accepted Chinese trademarks related to her fashion business, and the Saudi grants went to a World Bank fund she helped inspire, not to her directly.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the involvement of family members in the Trump administration is inherently biased or unethical. The expert's verdict does not address this assumption directly but provides information about the positions held by family members without making a judgment on their appropriateness.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim implies a connection between the employment of family members and unethical behavior or conflicts of interest. The expert's verdict does not provide an alternative explanation but presents the information about family members working in the administration without making a judgment on their actions.", "Understate": "The claim does not understate any information.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not contradict any factual information provided by the expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "The claim does not falter at times."}
