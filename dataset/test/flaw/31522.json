{"Exaggerate": "The claim of Scott Walker \"increasing his own pay by $50,000\" is an exaggeration because it fails to consider that Walker was still taking home less than what his salary provided.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a statement made by Advancing Wisconsin, a group that backs Democrat Tom Barrett, without providing any additional evidence or data.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that a reduction in voluntary pay cuts during a time of economic recovery should be considered as an increase in pay, which can be seen as a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the change in pay, such as the fact that the County Board, not the county executive, can change the salary, and that Walker had previously returned a larger portion of his salary to the county voluntarily."}
