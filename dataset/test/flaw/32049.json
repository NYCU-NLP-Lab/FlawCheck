{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered exaggerated as it states that 85 percent of immigrants don't show up for court hearings or schedule them, while the expert's verdict provides data that contradicts this figure.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as the expert's verdict provides data from the Department of Justice that refutes the claim.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact presented by the Department of Justice data, which states that 28 percent of migrants released in the U.S. didn't show up for their hearings during a specific fiscal year.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the United States' process for screening migrants at the Mexican border and granting asylum is \"broken,\" without providing sufficient evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict presents alternative explanations for why some immigrants may not show up for court hearings, such as severe strain on immigration courts and the release of detained individuals due to capacity constraints."}
