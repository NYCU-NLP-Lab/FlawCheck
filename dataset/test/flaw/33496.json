{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the achievements of the Founding Fathers by stating that they built an extra 11,200 kilometers of tarmacked roads after independence. This could be an overstatement of their accomplishments.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the initial state of tarmacked roads at independence by mentioning only 1,800 kilometers. This could downplay the starting point and make the subsequent increase seem more significant.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide any specific evidence or sources to support the statement that the Founding Fathers built 11,200 kilometers of tarmacked roads. It lacks sufficient information to back up the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the tarmacked roads were solely built by President Jomo Kenyatta, President Moi, and President Kibaki. It does not consider the contributions of other individuals or factors in the road construction.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the increase in tarmacked roads. It attributes the entire increase to the efforts of the mentioned presidents without exploring other potential factors or contributors."}
