{"Understate": "The claim may understate the legal authority of Gov. Gavin Newsom to make wearing face coverings mandatory in California, as the expert's verdict states that he does have the power to do so.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it contradicts the expert opinion of constitutional law experts who state that Newsom does have the legal authority to mandate face coverings.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that Newsom has no legal authority to make masks mandatory, without providing sufficient evidence or legal analysis to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the claim, such as political bias or disagreement with Newsom's policies, which could influence the belief that he lacks legal authority.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Newsom has issued a requirement for Californians to wear face coverings, which is supported by the expert's verdict and the press release from the California Department of Public Health."}
