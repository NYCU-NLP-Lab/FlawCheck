{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerated as it states that Mitt Romney wants \"to set a date for withdrawal\" from Iraq, which implies a specific and definite intention. However, the expert's verdict provides evidence that Romney disputed this and stated that he never had a specific date in mind.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or sources to back up the assertion that Mitt Romney wants to set a date for withdrawal from Iraq. The only source mentioned is an interview where Romney discusses the need for timetables and milestones, but it does not explicitly state that he wants to set a date for withdrawal.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the assumption that Mitt Romney's position on withdrawal from Iraq is the same as Hillary Clinton's, based on John McCain's remarks. However, this assumption may be problematic as it oversimplifies the complexity of their respective positions and ignores potential differences.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Mitt Romney's statement regarding timetables and milestones for withdrawal. The expert's verdict provides context to Romney's remarks, suggesting that they were related to the need for secrecy in military strategy rather than a specific desire to set a date for withdrawal."}
