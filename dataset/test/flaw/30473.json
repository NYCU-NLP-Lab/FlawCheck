(WEDC) were solely based on their association with Walker's campaign donors, without considering other factors that may have influenced the decisions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the financial incentives granted by WEDC to companies, such as their potential for job creation or economic growth, which are not addressed in the claim."}
