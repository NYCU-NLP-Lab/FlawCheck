{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the increase in premiums for men and women, stating that premiums are doubling for men and increasing by 99 percent, and increasing by 62 percent for women. The expert's verdict suggests that these numbers are not entirely accurate and may be exaggerated.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide enough evidence or support for the stated percentages. The expert's verdict mentions that the numbers came from an article in Forbes and analysis by the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, but it also points out that Hannity's statement went beyond the report itself. Therefore, the claim lacks sufficient support for the specific percentages mentioned.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in premiums is solely due to Obamacare, without considering other factors that may contribute to the increase. The expert's verdict mentions that Hannity made a common mistake by lumping in people who purchase insurance on their own with those who receive it through their employer. This assumption overlooks the complexity of the healthcare market and the various factors that can influence premium prices.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the increase in premiums. The expert's verdict mentions federal government subsidies that can partially offset higher premiums, suggesting that there are alternative factors to consider when evaluating the impact of Obamacare on premium prices.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that reliable answers regarding the cost of health insurance under Obamacare are difficult to obtain. The expert's verdict states that getting reliable answers can be treacherous due to the rollout issues of the Obamacare website. Therefore, the claim contradicts the fact that accurate information on premium increases may not be readily available.", "Understate": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim understates any aspect of the situation."}
