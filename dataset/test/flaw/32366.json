{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the cost of locking somebody up in California by stating that it costs about $75,000 a year. However, this bias is supported by the expert's verdict, which cites a report by the Associated Press that estimated the cost per inmate to reach a record $75,560 in the current fiscal year.", "Lack enough support": "While the claim provides specific figures for the cost of locking somebody up nationally ($33,000 a year) and in California ($75,000 a year), it does not provide sufficient evidence or sources to support these numbers. However, the expert's verdict mentions that the figures provided by Harris are based on data from the independent Vera Institute of Justice and the California Governor's spending plan.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that taxpayers are not getting a good return on investment when it comes to California's prison system. This assumption may be considered problematic as it does not take into account other factors such as public safety and the effectiveness of alternative programs.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim implies that alternatives to locking up inmates, such as drug treatment programs, are far cheaper and sometimes more effective than prison sentences. This suggests an alternative explanation for reducing costs and improving outcomes in the criminal justice system.", "Contradict fact": "There is no evident contradiction of fact in the claim or the expert's verdict.", "Understate": "There is no evident understatement in the claim or the expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "There is no evident faltering at times in the claim or the expert's verdict."}
