{"Lack enough support": "The claim that Splenda was inadequately tested and is unsafe for human consumption lacks sufficient evidence or studies to support it.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the limited number of human studies conducted on Splenda's safety is inadequate to determine its safety for human consumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that false claims have been made about sucralose being \"unnatural\" and unsafe, suggesting that there may be alternative explanations for the safety concerns raised.", "Exaggerate": "The expert's verdict highlights the potential health risks associated with Splenda, such as seizures, migraines, and weight gain. These risks may be exaggerated or not supported by strong scientific evidence.", "Understate": "The expert's verdict does not mention any potential benefits or positive findings regarding the safety of Splenda, potentially understating its overall safety profile.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Splenda has gained approval from regulatory agencies in multiple countries and has become the leading brand in the artificial sweetener market.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict may falter at times by presenting anecdotal evidence or relying on individual opinions, such as the statement from Dr. Joseph Mercola, without providing a comprehensive analysis of scientific research on Splenda's safety."}
