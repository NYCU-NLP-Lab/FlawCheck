{"Contradict fact": "If the claim suggests that the South Korean President was reading a script, but the experts and sources state that the photo was manipulated or doctored, then the claim contradicts the fact that the President was not actually reading a script.", "Exaggerate": "If the claim implies that the President's actions were nefarious or dishonest based on the photo, but the experts and sources indicate that the photo was manipulated, then the claim may be exaggerating the situation.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough evidence or support to prove that the President was actually reading a script, especially if the experts and sources state that the photo was manipulated.", "Problematic assumption": "If the claim assumes that the President's actions were deceptive or scripted based solely on the photo, without considering alternative explanations or expert analysis, it could be considered a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The experts and sources provide an alternative explanation for the photo, stating that the prompters were there to show the President questions from journalists, rather than indicating that he was reading a script. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the claim."}
