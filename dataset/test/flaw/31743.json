{"Exaggerate": "The claim suggests that getting access to a gun in America is easier than adopting a dog or registering to vote, which may be an exaggeration as it does not provide enough evidence to support this comparison.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim was backed up with information on the laws and regulations surrounding gun ownership, dog ownership, and voting in Wisconsin. However, it does not provide specific data or evidence to support the claim on a national scale, which may indicate a lack of enough support.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that private gun sales in Wisconsin are not regulated, and they can be conducted without a background check through websites like Armslist or Craigslist.
