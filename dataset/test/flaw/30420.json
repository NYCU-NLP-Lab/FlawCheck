{"Understate": "The claim understates the number of wildfires in Canada and Mexico by suggesting that there are none, when in fact there have been wildfires in both countries.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only provides a map without any additional evidence or data to back up the assertion that there are no wildfires in Canada and Mexico.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that wildfires are solely caused by political motivations or criminal behavior, which is false.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim ignores the alternative explanation that differences in climate, weather patterns, and fuel availability can contribute to variations in wildfire activity between different regions."}
