{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the impact of Donald Trump's abortion rule by stating that it puts at risk \"15 times more funding and millions more women and families\" compared to previous similar policies by Republican presidents. This is based on the expert's verdict that there is uncertainty surrounding Trump's policy.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that Trump's policy puts at risk 15 times more funding and millions more women and families. The expert's verdict mentions that the number is largely correct on paper, but there is uncertainty surrounding Trump's policy.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the previous similar policies by Republican presidents had a certain level of risk to funding and impact on women and families. However, it does not provide specific information or evidence about the previous policies to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or factors that may contribute to the potential risks to funding and impact on women and families. It focuses solely on the difference in scope between Trump's policy and previous policies without exploring other potential factors."}
