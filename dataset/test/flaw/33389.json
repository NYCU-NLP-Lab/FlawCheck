{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of subpoenas issued by the House majority compared to the number of bills passed.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific data or evidence to back up the comparison between subpoenas issued and bills passed.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of subpoenas issued is a valid metric to measure the productivity of the House majority, which is a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the difference in the number of subpoenas issued and bills passed, such as the complexity and time-consuming nature of passing legislation compared to issuing subpoenas.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that House Democrats have helped pass more than 500 bills and resolutions.", "Understate": "The claim understates the legislative accomplishments of House Democrats by focusing solely on the number of bills passed into law, without considering the number of bills passed by the House.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not specifying that the comparison is between subpoenas issued and House bills signed into law, leading to a misleading impression."}
