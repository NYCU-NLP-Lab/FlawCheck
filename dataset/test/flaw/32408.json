{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the increase in college tuition costs under the Democrats by stating that it has risen by 25 percent, while the actual increase is slightly under 20 percent for tuition plus room and board.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the statement that college tuition costs have risen specifically under the Democrats. It only provides a single statistic without any further context or comparison to other factors.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the rise in college tuition costs is solely attributed to the Democrats, without considering other factors or external influences that may have contributed to the increase.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or factors that may have contributed to the rise in college tuition costs, such as changes in state funding for education or inflation.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the increase in college tuition costs is slightly under 20 percent for tuition plus room and board, rather than the stated 25 percent.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the actual increase in college tuition costs by focusing only on in-state students at public universities, while there are other types of schools with smaller increases.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in terms of accuracy and clarity due to issues with translation and the lack of specificity in defining the \"costs\" being referred to (tuition alone or tuition plus room and board)."}
