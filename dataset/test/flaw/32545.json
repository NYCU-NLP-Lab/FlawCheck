{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent of the damage caused by supporters of Kapseret MP Oscar Sudi. The photos show a damaged section of the road, but it is not clear if it was intentionally destroyed or if it was a result of other factors.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that supporters of Oscar Sudi destroyed the road. The photos do not provide clear evidence of who caused the damage.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for the damage to the road, as it is reported that residents had blocked the road leading to Sudi's home with logs, stones, and tractors to stop the police from reaching him. It is possible that the damage was caused by these residents rather than supporters of Oscar Sudi.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the photos were not taken in Kenya, but in South Africa. Therefore, the claim that supporters of Oscar Sudi destroyed the road in Kenya is not accurate.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in accurately identifying the location and context of the photos. It initially attributes the photos to Kenya, but it is later revealed that they were taken in South Africa.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in this claim."}
