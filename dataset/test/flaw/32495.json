{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the number of people in jail for the crime of being poor and not being able to afford bail. The expert's verdict mentions that the figure provided by Bernie Sanders is higher than the estimate in a report by the Hamilton Project.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no official national tracking of the number of people in jail for being unable to afford bail. The expert's verdict mentions that researchers have used extrapolation methods to estimate the number.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all 200,000 people in jail are there solely because they are poor and cannot afford bail. The expert's verdict mentions that some of the \"unconvicted\" people held in jails may be awaiting commitment to a mental-health facility.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why people may be in jail, such as awaiting trial or being held without bail for other reasons. The expert's verdict mentions that some of the people in jail may have been held without bail or awaiting commitment to a mental-health facility.", "Contradict fact": "The claim may contradict the fact that there is no official national tracking of the number of people in jail for being unable to afford bail. The expert's verdict mentions that PolitiFact has reported this lack of official tracking.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the number of people in jail for being unable to afford bail, as the expert's verdict mentions a higher estimate of over 400,000 people based on a report by the Hamilton Project.", "Falters at times": "It is unclear if the claim falters at times as the provided information does not explicitly mention any inconsistencies or contradictions in the claim."}
