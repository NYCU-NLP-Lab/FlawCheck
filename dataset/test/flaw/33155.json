{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the size and significance of the rally by stating that it is \"unbelievably huge\" and has \"broken all previous records.\" This is an exaggeration as the photo is from a different rally that took place in April 2018, not the one in December 2020.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the photo is not from the political opposition rally in Pakistan in December 2020. The expert's verdict states that the photo is from a rally that occurred more than two years before the claimed event.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or additional information to support its assertion that the photo shows the political opposition rally in Pakistan in December 2020. The expert's verdict, on the other hand, provides evidence through a Google reverse image search and the publication of the photo by the ruling political party in 2018.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the alternative explanation that the photo is from a different rally that took place in April 2018. The expert's verdict presents this alternative explanation by providing evidence of the photo's origin and context.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in the claim."}
