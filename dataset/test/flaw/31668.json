{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that President Obama is reducing the naval fleet to 1917 levels, which is not supported by available statistics.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence or data provided to back up the assertion that President Obama is reducing the naval fleet to 1917 levels.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that reducing the naval fleet to 1917 levels is a negative action, without providing any context or explanation for why this would be problematic.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation that the fleet size has been decreasing over time due to various factors, such as budget constraints and changes in military strategy, rather than a deliberate effort by President Obama to reduce it."}
