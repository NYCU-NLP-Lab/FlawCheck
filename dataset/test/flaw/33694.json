{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of labs that are ready, willing, and able to conduct COVID-19 testing by stating \"hundreds and hundreds\" without providing sufficient evidence to support this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that the White House declined to provide the data or list of labs referenced by the president, indicating a lack of support for the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the existence of labs automatically translates to their readiness and ability to handle patient specimens, which may not be accurate.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that some labs on the list provided by the White House were already known to officials in certain states, indicating that there may be alternative explanations for the availability and readiness of labs.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the actual number of labs that are ready and able to conduct COVID-19 testing, as the expert's verdict mentions that there are already 127 labs listed by the FDA for processing tests under emergency authorization."}
