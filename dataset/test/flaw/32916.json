{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the impact of not having both outer and inner envelopes on Pennsylvania ballots. While it is true that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that \"naked ballots\" (those missing the secrecy envelope) will not be counted, the claim presents it as a critical factor that will determine the outcome of the race. This may be an exaggeration as the number of naked ballots may not be significant enough to sway the overall election results.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that Pennsylvania ballots will be rejected without outer and inner envelopes. It simply refers to a Facebook post and the ruling of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. Additional information or statistics would be needed to determine the extent of the issue.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the lack of both outer and inner envelopes on Pennsylvania ballots will result in rejection. While this is true based on the ruling of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, it does not consider alternative scenarios or potential remedies that could be implemented to address the issue.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not explore alternative explanations or reasons for the requirement of both outer and inner envelopes. It presents it as a straightforward rule without considering any potential benefits or reasons behind it.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the impact of not following the proper procedure for handling Pennsylvania ballots. While it is mentioned that ballots without both envelopes will not be counted, the claim does not delve into the potential consequences for voters who fail to follow the instructions. This could include their vote not being counted or their ballot being considered invalid.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not contradict any factual information provided in the expert's verdict. It aligns with the ruling of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court and the guidance provided by Pennsylvania's Secretary of State.", "Falters at times": "The claim does not exhibit any clear instances of faltering or inconsistency. It presents the requirement of both outer and inner envelopes as a definitive rule based on the ruling of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court."}
