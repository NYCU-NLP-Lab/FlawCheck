{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent to which pay-to-play was abolished by stating that it was prohibited for people with county or state contracts, when in reality it only applied to certain state contracts.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide evidence or specific details about how pay-to-play was abolished.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the abolition of pay-to-play was solely the result of the speaker's actions, without considering other factors or individuals involved in the process.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation to the claim, as it is stated that the pay-to-play reform was later turned into a law by the Legislature and acting Gov. Richard Codey, indicating that it was not solely the speaker's actions that abolished it."}
