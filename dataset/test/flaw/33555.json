{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the study was not \"banned\" but rather had the mention of fiscal benefits of admitting refugees removed before finalization.", "Understate": "The claim understates the costs of refugee resettlement by only mentioning the expenditures for accepting approximately 70,000 refugees in 2014, without considering the total annual cost.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it relies on a leaked document that was an early draft and never publicly released.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the leaked document accurately represents the final conclusions of the study, without considering potential changes or revisions made during the finalization process.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim presents an alternative explanation for the suppression of the study, suggesting that it was banned by the Trump administration to contradict their claim that refugees are too costly."}
