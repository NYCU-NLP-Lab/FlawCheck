{"Understate": "The claim states that \"more than 18 percent of Georgians still light up,\" which could be an understatement if the actual percentage is higher.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific data or evidence to support the statement that \"more than 18 percent of Georgians still light up.\" It only mentions the smoking rates in 2013 and 2014 without providing more recent or comprehensive data.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not explore other possible reasons or factors that may contribute to the smoking rate in Georgia, such as cultural or socioeconomic factors.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the smoking rate in Georgia decreased from 18.8 percent in 2013 to 17.4 percent in 2014, as mentioned in the expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not providing a clear and up-to-date picture of the smoking rate in Georgia, as it only mentions data from 2013 and 2014.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the smoking rate in Georgia should align with the national goal of 12 percent by 2020, without considering the specific challenges or circumstances in Georgia that may affect smoking rates differently.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the issue by using the phrase \"more than 18 percent,\" which could imply a higher prevalence of smoking than the actual percentage."}
