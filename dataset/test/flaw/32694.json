The photo itself does not provide any context or details about the situation.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the photo accurately depicts a man carrying a snake-bitten horse to the hospital. However, there is no verification or confirmation of this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The photo is actually a picture of Ukrainian weightlifter Dmytro Khaladzhi, who performs feats of strength. The claim wrongly attributes the image to a man saving a snake-bitten horse, suggesting an alternative explanation for the photo.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the photo is not related to a man saving a snake-bitten horse, but rather depicts a weightlifter performing a strength feat. The information provided by the expert's verdict debunks the claim."}
