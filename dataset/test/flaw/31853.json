{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that all mentions of \"pro-life\" were scrubbed from the Donald J. Trump campaign website, when in fact there were press releases that mentioned his \"pro-life\" stance.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on an article from a Christian blog, which later retracted its statement and apologized for the incorrect reporting.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that Trump's removal of the phrase \"pro-life\" from his policies on the website indicates a change in his stance on abortion, without providing evidence or considering alternative explanations.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the removal of the phrase \"pro-life\" from the policies section, such as website updates or changes in campaign messaging strategy."}
