{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the price of the oximeter purchased by the AAP-led Delhi government, stating it was bought for Rs 66,320, which is significantly higher than the normal price range of Rs 500 and 1000.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that the oximeter was purchased for a higher price.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the AAP-led Delhi government engaged in corruption based on the price of the oximeter without considering alternative explanations or additional information.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by stating that the purchased oximeters were not ordinary finger pulse oximeters but a special type of table-top oximeters, which could justify the higher price."}
