{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered exaggerated as it states that corporate taxes \"bring in less than 9 percent\" of federal tax revenue today, while the expert's verdict indicates that it is actually around 10 percent.", "Understate": "The claim may be seen as understating the decrease in corporate tax revenue by not fully acknowledging that it has dropped from 33 percent in 1952 to 10 percent in 2013.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that \"record-breaking profits\" are the reason for the decrease in corporate tax revenue.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes a direct causal relationship between \"record-breaking profits\" and the decrease in corporate tax revenue without providing evidence or considering other factors that could contribute to this trend.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the decrease in corporate tax revenue, such as changes in tax policies or the shifting global economic landscape."}
