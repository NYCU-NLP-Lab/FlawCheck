{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent of the disparity in unemployment rates between black and white workers in Texas. While it is stated that the black unemployment rate is \"far more than double\" the white unemployment rate, the specific numbers are not provided in the claim.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the impact of falling wages on black workers in Texas since 2000. It is mentioned that wages have fallen for black workers, but the magnitude of the decrease is not specified.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific data or evidence to support the assertion that wages have fallen for black workers in Texas since 2000. The claim refers to a report by the Center for Popular Democracy, but it does not provide specific details or methodology from the report.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas has the power to directly influence jobs and wages for all communities in Texas. It implies that choosing a president who prioritizes jobs and rising wages will automatically lead to improvements for African Americans in the state, which may be a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the disparities in unemployment rates and wages between black and white workers in Texas. Factors such as educational attainment, job availability, and discrimination could also contribute to these disparities."}
