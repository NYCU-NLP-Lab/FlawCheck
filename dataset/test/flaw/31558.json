{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the statement that there are more young black males involved in the criminal justice system than in higher education. The statistics provided by the spokesperson for Ben Carson's committee are not directly applicable to young black males in college.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that involvement in the criminal justice system can be equated to being in prison or jail, on probation or parole, or being arrested. However, this assumption overlooks the fact that many arrests do not result in charges or convictions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the higher number of young black males in the criminal justice system, such as systemic biases in law enforcement or socioeconomic factors.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by using incomplete and misleading statistics to support its argument. The fact that the statistics cited for involvement in the criminal justice system are based on arrests rather than the number of individuals involved raises doubts about the accuracy of the claim.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the number of young black males involved in higher education by not providing any data or statistics on their enrollment rates.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the statistics cited by the spokesperson for Ben Carson's committee do not specifically pertain to young black males involved in the criminal justice system or in higher education.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may potentially exaggerate the extent of the disparity between young black males in the criminal justice system and those in higher education by not providing comprehensive and accurate data on both groups."}
