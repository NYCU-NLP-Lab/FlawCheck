{"Contradict fact": "The claim that a prostitute named Gerda Puridle invented elongated eyelashes in the 1880s contradicts the fact that the woman in the picture is not Gerda Puridle and the claim is made up.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that Gerda Puridle invented elongated eyelashes in the 1880s.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Gerda Puridle was the inventor of elongated eyelashes without providing any substantial evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert provides an alternative explanation by stating that the practice of artificially elongating eyelashes started in the late 1800s, but the first patent for an artificial eyelash was not secured until 1911. This suggests that there may have been other inventors or contributors to the development of artificial eyelashes during that time period."}
