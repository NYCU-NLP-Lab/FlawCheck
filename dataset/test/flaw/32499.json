Ilhan Omar \"at an Al\u2019 Qaida training camp in Somalia,\" when in fact, the photo was taken in 1978, three years before Omar was born.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the photo is authentic but does not depict Ilhan Omar at an Al\u2019 Qaida training camp.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that Ilhan Omar was ever at an Al\u2019 Qaida training camp.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that the photo is evidence of Ilhan Omar's association with Al\u2019 Qaida, without providing any substantial evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for the photo, which is that it shows a woman recruit of the Somali Army checking her automatic weapon, as stated in the caption."}
