{"Lack enough support": "The claim is supported by multiple independent polls, including one from Quinnipiac University and another from Pew Research Center and CBS/New York Times. These polls consistently show high percentages of support for universal background checks among Americans.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter when it comes to other gun control proposals such as bans on assault weapons and high capacity magazines, as these measures have lower levels of support compared to background checks.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the support for background checks translates to support for gun legislation in general, which may not necessarily be the case.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the high levels of support for background checks, such as the wording of the questions in the polls or the specific demographics of the respondents."}
