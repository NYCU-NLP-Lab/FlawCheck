{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the impact of cannabis legalization on the profits of the Corrections Corporation of America (CCA). The expert's verdict states that the quoted wording in the meme does not express CCA's stated reason for opposing marijuana legalization.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or sources for the statement that CCA spends $1 million per year fighting changes to marijuana laws. The expert's verdict mentions that the image meme was missing any sources, citations, date, or context for the purported statement from CCA.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that CCA's opposition to marijuana legalization is solely based on the potential harm to their profits. The expert's verdict mentions that CCA's lobbying expenditures don't focus solely on marijuana prohibition, indicating that there may be other reasons for their opposition.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests an alternative explanation for CCA's opposition to marijuana legalization, stating that the privatized incarceration system has a strong incentive to ensure prison populations remain high enough to maintain profit levels.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the quoted wording in the meme does not come from a \"memo\" and does not express CCA's stated reason for opposing marijuana legalization, according to the expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "It is difficult to determine if the claim falters at times as the provided information does not explicitly indicate any inconsistencies or inconsistencies in the claim.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the overall impact of CCA's lobbying efforts as it focuses specifically on marijuana legalization. The expert's verdict mentions that CCA spends approximately $1 million on lobbying per year, but it does not specify the extent to which these efforts are directed towards opposing marijuana laws."}
