{"Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that the data used to support the claim is from a study conducted in 2014 and is at least six years old as of 2020. This suggests that there may be a lack of up-to-date evidence to fully support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The expert's verdict states that it is possible that the lifetime incidence of abortion may have changed between 2014 and 2020, and there is good reason to believe it may have declined. This suggests that the claim may make an assumption about the current prevalence of abortion without considering potential changes over time.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim has been used by those opposed to abortion rights, suggesting that there may be alternative motivations or agendas behind the promotion of this claim."}
