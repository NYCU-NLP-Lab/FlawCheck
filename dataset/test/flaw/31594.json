{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it is based on estimates and varying data from multiple sources. The figures provided by CNN did not adjust for population size and did not include certain countries with high rates of firearms-related homicides.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of school shootings in the United States is significantly higher than in 27 other countries combined. However, this assumption is problematic as it does not take into account the different contexts, definitions, and reporting methods used by various sources.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent of school shootings in the United States by stating that they experienced \"many times more\" shootings than 27 other countries combined. This statement lacks specific quantitative data and relies on a broad comparison without considering the population size or other factors.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in terms of providing consistent and reliable data. The figures and definitions used to determine school shootings vary from source to source, making it difficult to accurately compare the numbers.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the number of school shootings in other countries by only including 27 selected countries in the comparison. This limited selection may not provide a comprehensive picture of school shootings worldwide.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the differences in school shootings between the United States and other countries. Factors such as cultural, social, and political differences could contribute to variations in school shooting incidents."}
