{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the number of lives lost from violence against women, sex-selective abortion, female infanticide, suicide, egregious maternal mortality, and other sex-linked causes by comparing it to the number of deaths in all wars and civil strife of the 20th century.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support as the expert's analysis finds that the numbers are comparable but some estimates find the number of war deaths to be slightly higher.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the devaluation of female life leads to a higher number of lost lives than wars and conflicts, which may be a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the differences in male-to-female ratios and the number of missing women, which could impact the validity of the claim."}
