{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the severity of the situation by using phrases like \"Monkeys invade Pretoria hospital ward\" and \"As the monkeys invade the ward.\"", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that monkeys are invading the hospital ward. The provided evidence only includes a video of monkeys in a hospital ward, but there is no confirmation that it is a recurring or ongoing issue.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the presence of monkeys in the hospital ward is directly related to the preparation for the coronavirus, which may be a problematic assumption as there is no clear connection established.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the presence of monkeys in the hospital ward, such as the hospital being located in an area where monkeys are commonly seen and the monkeys simply entering the ward in search of food.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the video actually shows a ward inside RK Khan Hospital in Durban, not in Pretoria as initially claimed. This inconsistency undermines the credibility of the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in terms of accuracy and consistency, as it initially mentions Pretoria but later changes it to Durban, which raises doubts about the reliability of the information provided.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in the claim."}
