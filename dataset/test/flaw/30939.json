{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the amount of sea-level rise in South Florida since the 1920s. The actual measurement is 0.78 feet, which is roughly nine inches, but the claim presents it as a significant and dangerous rise.", "Lack enough support": "While the claim is supported by data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, it does not provide additional evidence or sources to back up the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the sea-level rise will ultimately cause homes to be underwater in just a few short years, without providing sufficient evidence or considering other factors that could affect the rate of rise.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or factors that could contribute to the observed sea-level rise, such as land-based reference points or natural geological processes.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not providing a comprehensive analysis of projections for future sea-level rise, which could be important in understanding the long-term implications of the observed rise.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the actual sea-level rise in South Florida since the 1920s is 0.78 feet, not nine inches as stated."}
