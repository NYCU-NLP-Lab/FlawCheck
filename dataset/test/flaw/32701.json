{"Exaggerate": "The claim that President Obama has raised taxes 19 times may be an exaggeration if the definition of \"tax\" is not accurately applied to all instances mentioned.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific examples or evidence to support the assertion that President Obama has raised taxes 19 times.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that raising taxes is inherently negative and stunts economic growth, without providing sufficient evidence or considering alternative perspectives.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for any perceived tax increases, such as changes in rules or exemptions that may not necessarily result in a direct increase in taxes for all individuals or businesses."}
