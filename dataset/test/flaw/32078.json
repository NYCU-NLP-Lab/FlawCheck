The expert's verdict mentions that none of these archaeological discoveries have made their way into museums or scientific journals.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the photographs prove the Bible to be true, without providing any substantial evidence. The expert's verdict highlights that these hoaxes often tie the photographs to biblical accounts of giants, but there is no factual basis for this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict explains that the photographs are digital manipulations created for Photoshop contests or hoaxes.
