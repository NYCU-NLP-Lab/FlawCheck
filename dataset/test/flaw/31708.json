{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent of Smith's lead in the polls by stating that she is beating both Cunningham and Tillis in \"every poll out of the gate,\" when in reality, there are only a few polls where she has polled ahead of them.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the assertion that Smith is leading in every poll against both Cunningham and Tillis.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that leading in polls at the beginning of a race is a significant indicator of success, without considering other factors such as campaign strategies, fundraising, or voter turnout.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Smith's performance in the polls, such as the low approval rating of Tillis or the endorsement and fundraising support received by Cunningham.", "Understate": "The claim understates the significance of Smith's performance by not acknowledging that her lead over Tillis in the polls is within the margin of error in most cases, indicating a close race rather than a clear victory."}
