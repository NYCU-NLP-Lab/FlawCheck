{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the actions of the refugees by stating that they are throwing rocks and trying to kill people, without providing sufficient evidence or context to support this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide enough evidence or factual information to support the assertion that refugees are throwing rocks and trying to kill people. The provided image is misappropriated and does not show migrants throwing rocks.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the migrants fleeing Central America are violent and pose a threat to others without providing substantial evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for the image used in the claim, as it is actually related to the First Intifada in 1987 and not the migrant caravan.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that most of the migrants traveling with the caravans have been peaceful and are fleeing violence and poverty in their home countries.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by relying on a misappropriated image and making unsupported assertions about the behavior of refugees.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in the provided claim."}
