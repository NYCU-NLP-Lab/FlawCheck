{"Exaggerate": "The claim of Joe Biden receiving 100% of the 128,000 new votes in Michigan is an exaggeration. The error in the vote count in Shiawassee County was a typo, and the correct count was 15,371 votes, not 153,710. Therefore, the claim of Biden receiving 100% of the votes is exaggerated.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support because it is based on a typo made by the election analysis service Decision Desk HQ. The error was corrected, and there is no evidence to support the claim that Biden received 100% of the new votes in Michigan.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the error in the vote count was intentional or indicative of fraudulent activity. However, the error was a simple typo and was promptly corrected. There is no evidence to support the assumption that the error was malicious or had any impact on the election results.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The alternative explanation for the claim is that it was based on a typo made by the election analysis service. The error was an unintentional mistake and was corrected. The claim does not consider this alternative explanation and instead jumps to the conclusion that it is evidence of wrongdoing.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the error in the vote count was a typo and not a deliberate attempt to boost Biden's vote count. The claim falsely implies that Biden received 100% of the new votes in Michigan, which is not true.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not considering the possibility of a simple typo being the cause of the error in the vote count. It jumps to conclusions without sufficient evidence and fails to acknowledge the correction made to the count.", "Understate": "There is no understatement bias in the claim."}
