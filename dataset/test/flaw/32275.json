{"Contradict fact": "The claim that the government in Oklahoma is planning to detain people unless they can show proof of vaccination contradicts the fact that the video in question was made in 2009 and had nothing to do with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as an exaggeration since it presents a scenario of forced detention based on vaccination status without sufficient evidence or current relevance.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a video from 2009 that does not pertain to the current situation.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video circulating in 2020 is related to the COVID-19 pandemic and the government's vaccination plans, which is a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The alternative explanation is that the video is a variation of conspiracy theories regarding mass detention and forced vaccination, rather than an accurate representation of government plans in Oklahoma."}
