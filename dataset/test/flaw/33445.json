{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent of rainforest deforestation by suggesting that it occurred within a span of 10 years. The expert's verdict states that the image used in the claim does not accurately represent the suggested dates and that the photo was taken in May 2018. The expert also mentions that deforestation is a big problem in the area, but the specific photo does not show that.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as the provided image does not accurately depict the suggested timeframe. The expert's verdict mentions that the image was found on Shutterstock and was taken in May 2018, which contradicts the claim's assertion of rainforest deforestation over 10 years.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the image used accurately represents the extent of rainforest deforestation over a 10-year period. However, the expert's verdict points out that the image does not show the suggested dates and that it was taken in May 2018, indicating a problematic assumption in the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for the image used in the claim. The photographer, Richard Carey, stated that the image was of a section of the forest being cleared in 2018 to make room for a palm oil factory. This alternative explanation contradicts the claim's suggestion of rainforest deforestation over 10 years."}
