{"Understate": "The claim may understate the decrease in income for the bottom 90 percent of earners by only stating that it is a decrease of about 9 percent. The actual decrease could be higher.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks additional supporting evidence beyond the data from Saez and Piketty. It would be beneficial to include other sources or studies to provide a more comprehensive analysis.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the government's economic policies are solely responsible for the decrease in income for the average family not in the top 10 percent. Other factors, such as technological advancements and globalization, could also contribute to this trend.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the decrease in income, such as changes in the labor market or shifts in industries."}
