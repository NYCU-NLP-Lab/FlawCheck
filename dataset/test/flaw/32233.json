{"Exaggerate": "The claim states that a Harvard study proved that \"unvaccinated children pose no risk\" to other kids, which is an exaggerated statement as the expert's verdict points out that the conclusions made in the study are unsupported by science.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that the conclusions made by the author of the study are problematic and unsupported by science, indicating a lack of sufficient evidence to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that laws requiring mandatory vaccinations for schoolchildren are misguided, based on the argument that most vaccines do not prevent the transmission of disease. However, the expert's verdict states that the reasoning behind this assumption is problematic and flawed.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides alternative explanations for the claims made in the study, pointing out that diseases like tetanus and hepatitis B can still pose risks, even if the likelihood of transmission in a school setting is low.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that certain diseases, such as tetanus and hepatitis B, can still pose risks even if the likelihood of transmission in a school setting is low. The expert's verdict provides evidence to counter the claim's assertion that unvaccinated children pose no risk.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict mentions that the author of the study falters in their reasoning and conclusions, indicating that the claim may also falter in its accuracy and reliability.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential risks posed by unvaccinated children, as the expert's verdict points out that diseases like tetanus and hepatitis B can still be dangerous and potentially fatal, even if the likelihood of transmission in a school setting is low."}
