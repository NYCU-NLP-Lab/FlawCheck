{"Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that they were unable to find the original source or corroboration for the attribution of one of the images. This suggests that there is a lack of enough support for the claim that the photographs are related to the slave trade in Libya in 2017.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the photographs included in the Facebook post show the slave trade in Libya in 2017. However, the expert's verdict reveals that one of the photographs is actually from the Ivory Coast in 2011, during a period of unrest and violence following a presidential election. This highlights a problematic assumption made in the claim.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that one of the photographs is not related to the slave trade in Libya in 2017, as it was taken in the Ivory Coast in 2011. This contradiction undermines the credibility of the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for one of the photographs, stating that it was taken during unrest and violence in the Ivory Coast in 2011. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the other photographs as well, casting doubt on the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times due to the lack of enough support, contradictory evidence, and alternative explanations provided by the expert's verdict. This indicates that the claim is not consistently reliable or accurate."}
