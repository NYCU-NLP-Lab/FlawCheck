{"Exaggerate": "The claim made by President Trump that TransCanada Corp. \"dropped\" a multi-billion-dollar lawsuit against the U.S. after he threatened to \"terminate\" the company's Keystone XL pipeline is exaggerated. The expert's verdict states that TransCanada merely suspended its lawsuit to give the Trump administration time to approve the project, and they can resume their legal case if necessary.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on President Trump's statement without providing any evidence or sources to back it up.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that TransCanada dropped the lawsuit solely due to President Trump's threat to terminate the Keystone XL pipeline. However, the expert's verdict clarifies that TransCanada suspended the lawsuit to allow time for project approval by the Trump administration.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that TransCanada did not drop the lawsuit but rather suspended it temporarily.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation is provided by the expert's verdict, which states that TransCanada suspended the lawsuit to give the Trump administration an opportunity to approve the project."}
