{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that \"only 1 percent of the species that have been listed have actually been delisted.\"", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that a high delisting rate is an indicator of the success or failure of the Endangered Species Act, without considering other factors such as the complexity of species recovery or the effectiveness of conservation efforts.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the successes of the Endangered Species Act by focusing only on the delisting rate and not acknowledging the significant achievements in saving species like the bald eagle, gray whale, peregrine falcon, and American alligator.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the Endangered Species Act has had some dramatic successes, as mentioned in the provided information.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the low delisting rate, such as the challenges and complexities involved in species recovery and the long-term nature of conservation efforts.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times by oversimplifying the complexities of species conservation and recovery, leading to a misleading representation of the effectiveness of the Endangered Species Act."}
