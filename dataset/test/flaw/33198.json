{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent of the deficit reduction, stating that it turned a $110 million deficit into a $1.6 million surplus. However, the expert's analysis suggests that the deficit was not exactly $110 million and the surplus is relatively small compared to the city's budget.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the assertion that the deficit was completely eliminated and a surplus was achieved. The expert's analysis questions the use of the term \"structural deficit\" and suggests that most people may not understand its meaning.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the deficit reduction was solely due to the actions of the mayor, without considering other factors or external influences. The expert's analysis mentions the involvement of the city's unions and the need for concessions, as well as increased taxes, to raise revenue.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's analysis suggests that the deficit reduction may not have been solely attributed to the actions of the mayor, as it mentions the involvement of the city's unions and collaborative efforts to bring down costs and raise revenue.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in its precision and consistency in describing the deficit reduction. The expert's analysis points out that the claim was more precise in a budget address, but the term \"structural deficit\" may not be well understood by the general public.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the complexity of the financial situation and the efforts required to address the deficit. The expert's analysis mentions the need for cutbacks, concessions, and increased taxes to achieve the deficit reduction.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the expert's analysis, which suggests that the deficit reduction may not have been as straightforward as claimed and questions the use of the term \"structural deficit.\""}
