{"Lack enough support": "The claim that the woman killed during the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol assault was shot by a Secret Service agent, not Capitol Police, lacks sufficient evidence or supporting information.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Secret Service agent, not Capitol Police, was responsible for the shooting without presenting substantial proof or investigation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim ignores the possibility that the Capitol Police officer who fired the shot was justified in using force to protect themselves or others.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the woman was shot by a Secret Service agent, as it is stated in the claim, rather than Capitol Police.", "Understate": "The claim may downplay the complexity of the situation and the overall events that led to the woman's death.", "Falters at times": "The claim may contain inconsistencies or inaccuracies in its presentation of the events and individuals involved.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the role of the Secret Service agent in the shooting, potentially painting them as the sole responsible party without sufficient evidence."}
