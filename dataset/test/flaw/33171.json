{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which illegal immigration and the crime rate are at their lowest levels in decades. The expert's verdict mentions that there is no reliable count of illegal immigration, and the number of apprehensions by the U.S. Border Patrol is an imperfect metric. Additionally, while crime rates have generally been declining, there have been some indications of an uptick in recent years.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that illegal immigration and the crime rate are as low as they've been in decades. The expert's verdict mentions the limitations of available data on illegal immigration and crime rates, indicating a lack of sufficient support for the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the low levels of illegal immigration and the crime rate are solely attributable to current policies or actions. However, the expert's verdict mentions that the number of people attempting to cross the border is also influenced by economic conditions and that crime rates have been declining for years, indicating that there may be alternative factors at play.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the levels of illegal immigration and the crime rate, such as economic conditions and enforcement efforts. This implies that the claim's assertion that these levels are solely due to current circumstances may not be accurate."}
