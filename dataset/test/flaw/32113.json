{"Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that homosexuality being a felony in some states in the U.S. is a valid comparison to Russia's anti-gay laws. This assumption may be problematic as it equates the legal status of homosexuality in the U.S. with the discriminatory and oppressive laws in Russia.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or specific examples to support the assertion that homosexuality remains a felony in some states in the U.S. It mentions several states with anti-sodomy laws, but it does not provide comprehensive information or statistics on the current legal status of homosexuality in those states.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the severity of the situation by suggesting that the criminalization of homosexuality in some U.S. states is not a significant issue. It dismisses the fact that some states have laws that treat homosexuality as a felony, even if prosecutions are rare or the laws have been invalidated by the Supreme Court.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the Supreme Court's ruling in Lawrence v. Texas invalidated anti-sodomy laws, including those targeting homosexuality. While the claim acknowledges this fact, it still asserts that homosexuality remains a felony in some states without clarifying the legal status after the Supreme Court ruling.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation could be that the claim is attempting to draw attention to the existence of anti-sodomy laws in some states, even if they have been invalidated or are rarely enforced. The claim may be highlighting the ongoing presence of discriminatory laws rather than accurately describing the legal status of homosexuality as a felony."}
