{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the reduction in New York's uninsured rate, stating it has been cut in half since 2013, when the actual data shows a slight increase in recent years.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the uninsured rate has been cut in half. The provided data shows fluctuations in the uninsured rate, but not a consistent reduction.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the reduction in the uninsured rate is solely due to the state health exchange and the Affordable Care Act, without considering other factors that may have influenced the rate.", "Exist alternative explanation": "Experts suggest that the reduction in the uninsured rate may be attributed to factors such as the availability of online health plan comparisons and premium reductions, rather than solely the state health exchange and the Affordable Care Act.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in accurately representing the data on uninsured New Yorkers, as the provided data shows fluctuations and a slight increase in the uninsured rate in recent years.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the actual reduction in the uninsured rate, as the data shows a decrease from 10.6 percent in 2012 to 4.9 percent in 2015, which is more than a 50% reduction.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the uninsured rate increased to 5.4 percent in 2016, which is higher than the 2015 rate, indicating that the rate did not consistently decrease as claimed."}
