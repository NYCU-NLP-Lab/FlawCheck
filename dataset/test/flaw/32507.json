{"Exaggerate": "The claim that the CPAC convention stage was shaped like a Nazi symbol may be seen as an exaggeration, as there is no evidence to suggest that the similarities between the stage and the odal rune were intentional.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no concrete evidence provided to prove that the stage design was intentionally shaped like a Nazi symbol.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the stage design was meant to send a hidden message to white supremacists without providing sufficient evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The spokesperson for the ACU and CPAC stated that the stage design was chosen from several proposals and adapted to fit the ballroom space, suggesting that the similarities with the odal rune may have been coincidental rather than intentional."}
