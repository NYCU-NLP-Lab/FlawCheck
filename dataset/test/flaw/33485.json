{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the percentage of federal tax filers who paid zero federal income tax. The expert's verdict states that 51 percent of taxpayers in 2009 had zero liability, which is slightly lower than the claim's statement of \"fifty-one percent of federal tax filers paid zero federal income tax.\"", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or sources to support the statement that 51 percent of federal tax filers paid zero federal income tax.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the existence of \"a dizzying number of credits, deductions, and loopholes\" in the tax code is the main reason why 51 percent of federal tax filers paid zero federal income tax. However, the expert's verdict mentions that popular tax breaks, which primarily benefit high-income earners, contribute significantly to reducing taxes.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why 51 percent of federal tax filers paid zero federal income tax, such as the existence of tax breaks that primarily benefit high-income earners.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter by not providing a clear distinction between \"tax units\" and \"households\" when discussing the percentage of tax filers who had zero tax liability. The expert's verdict mentions that the terminology used by the claim is not exactly accurate.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the percentage of federal tax filers who paid zero federal income tax. The expert's verdict states that for tax year 2009, roughly 22 percent of \"tax units\" ended up without any tax liability, and another 30 percent got all their tax money back from the government, resulting in a total of 51 percent of taxpayers with zero liability. However, the claim only mentions the 51 percent figure without providing the breakdown.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not necessarily contradict any specific facts mentioned in the expert's verdict."}
