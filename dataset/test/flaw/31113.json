{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of the bill passed by Republicans, suggesting that Wisconsin women facing pay discrimination can't \"do something about it\" anymore. The expert's verdict states that there are still options available for women to file complaints and seek remedies.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the bill passed by Republicans completely eliminates the ability of women to address pay discrimination, which is a problematic assumption. The expert's verdict clarifies that there are alternative routes and options for women to seek recourse.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to substantiate the assertion that women can no longer take action against pay discrimination. The expert's verdict provides evidence of other avenues for women to pursue complaints and seek remedies.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the alternative explanation that the bill passed by Republicans may have different implications or may not entirely restrict women from addressing pay discrimination. The expert's verdict presents alternative routes and options available to women."}
