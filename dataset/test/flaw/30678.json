{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of the Clean Power Plan by stating that it eliminates coal-fired power plants, when in reality it only requires phase-outs of many existing coal-fueled plants.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Clean Power Plan eliminates coal-fired power plants without providing enough evidence or support for this assumption.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the assertion that the Clean Power Plan eliminates coal-fired power plants.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation to the claim, as experts have stated that the plan does not outlaw coal as fuel or require coal-fired plants to close, but rather targets outdated and inefficient coal plants."}
