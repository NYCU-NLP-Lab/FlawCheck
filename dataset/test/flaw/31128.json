{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the visibility of the Himalayas from northern India, stating that it was the first time in 30 years. The expert's verdict mentions that while anecdotal evidence suggests that the Himalayas are rarely visible, it cannot be definitively confirmed that they have not been seen for the last 30 years.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient scientific evidence to support the assertion that the Himalayas have not been seen from northern India for 30 years due to pollution. The expert's verdict mentions that this is an anecdotal observation and not based on scientific findings.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the visibility of the Himalayas in April 2020 was solely due to a decrease in pollution caused by the nationwide lockdown. The expert's verdict mentions that changing seasons and less human traffic likely played a part in the increased visibility.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the increased visibility of the Himalayas, such as changing seasons and less human traffic. This contradicts the claim's assumption that the visibility was solely due to decreased pollution.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the Himalayas have not been definitively confirmed to have not been seen from northern India for the last 30 years. The expert's verdict mentions that while anecdotal evidence suggests rare visibility, it cannot be definitively confirmed.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by making a definitive statement about the visibility of the Himalayas from northern India for the first time in 30 years without sufficient evidence. The expert's verdict mentions that it cannot be definitively confirmed.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in the claim or the expert's verdict."}
