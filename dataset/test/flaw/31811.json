{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that multiple independent investigations, including a bipartisan Senate report, determined that Russia interfered in the 2016 election to benefit Trump, not Obama.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Obama \"spied on my campaign, and got caught!\" without providing sufficient evidence to support this assertion.", "Understate": "The claim understates the findings of multiple reports that confirm that Obama did not initiate or attempt to influence the FBI's work.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to substantiate the accusation that Obama spied on the campaign, as no evidence is provided.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Obama was directly involved in spying on the campaign without providing any concrete evidence or proof.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or possibilities for the FBI's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election."}
