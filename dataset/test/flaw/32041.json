{"Exaggerate": "The claim suggests that Ted Cruz distributed an ad showing a nude Melania Trump on a rug. This may be an exaggeration as there is no evidence provided to support this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or proof to support the assertion that Ted Cruz distributed the ad.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The ad was actually created and distributed by a super PAC called Make America Awesome, and there is no evidence to suggest that Ted Cruz was involved in its creation or distribution."}
