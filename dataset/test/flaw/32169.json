{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it relies on a single graphic without providing additional data or evidence to back up the assertion that Democratic administrations have led to larger declines in abortion rates.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the decline in abortion rates during Democratic administrations is solely due to their approach of making abortions unnecessary, while overlooking other potential factors that may have contributed to the decline.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the role of Republican administrations in reducing abortion rates by suggesting that their approach of making the procedure illegal is less effective.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by oversimplifying the complex factors that influence abortion rates and attributing the decline solely to the political party in power.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the decline in abortion rates, such as changes in societal attitudes, access to contraception, or other healthcare policies that may have been implemented regardless of the political party in power."}
