{"Exaggerate": "The claim that support for immigration reform among Hispanics is close to universal may be an exaggeration. The poll data provided shows that 41 percent of Hispanics prioritize creating a path to citizenship, but this does not necessarily indicate that support is close to universal.", "Lack enough support": "The evidence provided, which includes a single poll with a small sample size, may not be sufficient to support the claim that almost every Hispanic in the country wants to see immigration reform. More comprehensive and diverse data would be needed to make such a broad claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all Hispanics have the same opinion on immigration reform, which may not be accurate. The poll data only represents a subset of Hispanics and does not account for the diversity of opinions within the Hispanic community.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the varying levels of support for immigration reform among Hispanics. Different factors such as political ideology, socioeconomic status, and personal experiences may influence individual opinions on this issue."}
