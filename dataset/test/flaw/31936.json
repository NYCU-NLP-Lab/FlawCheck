{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the likelihood of Joe Biden legitimately winning the four states, stating it is \"less than one in a quadrillion\" chance.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in its analysis by not considering the different demographics and voting patterns in different counties within the states.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it relies on flawed statistical calculations and assumptions.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that any two large groups of voters should generate substantially similar results, which is a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim ignores the alternative explanation that the difference in early and late returns is due to the demographics and voting patterns in different areas of the states."}
