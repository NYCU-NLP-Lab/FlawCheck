{"Understate": "The claim of not taking any corporate PAC money understates the fact that the candidate still receives donations from other types of non-corporate PACs, some of which are funded by corporate PACs and other business interests.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times because it ignores the fact that the candidate's donor list includes CEOs, lobbyists, real estate developers, and other corporate individuals.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to fully prove that the candidate is completely free from corporate influence, as political PACs, which are often funded by corporate PACs or other corporate interests, contribute to the campaign.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that not taking corporate PAC money automatically means the candidate is not beholden to corporations, which may be a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation exists, as the candidate receives significant donations from political PACs, which may still have corporate ties and influence."}
