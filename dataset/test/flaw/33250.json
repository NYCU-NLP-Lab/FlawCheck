{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the number of empty student stations by stating that there are 825,000 empty student stations in every district and at every grade level. This number may be inflated or not accurately reflect the actual number of empty student stations.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or data to support the statement that there are 825,000 empty student stations across Florida. It only mentions that the Yes on 8 group states this on their website without providing any further evidence or sources.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the existence of empty student stations justifies the need to change the class size rules. It assumes that the empty student stations can accommodate the overcrowded classrooms without considering other factors such as school capacity or the distribution of empty student stations across districts and grade levels.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the existence of empty student stations. It does not explore other reasons why there may be empty student stations, such as changes in enrollment, school closures, or the availability of alternative educational options."}
