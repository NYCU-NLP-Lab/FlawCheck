{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Trump would automatically lose his post-presidency perks if he is impeached for a second time. Two-thirds of the Senate would have to vote to convict him while he is still in office for him to lose those perks.", "Understate": "The claim understates the fact that the Senate could also bar Trump from holding public office again if they vote to convict him.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide evidence or sources to back up the statement.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that a second impeachment automatically means Trump loses his lifetime pension, travel allowance, Secret Service detail, and ability to run for public office, which is not accurate.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations or scenarios that could affect Trump's post-presidency perks and ability to run for public office, but the claim does not consider them."}
