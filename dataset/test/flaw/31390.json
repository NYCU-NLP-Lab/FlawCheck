{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the connection between flu vaccination and testing positive for COVID-19, as there is no scientific evidence to support this link.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that flu vaccines do not cause false positive results for COVID-19, as stated by multiple experts.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient scientific evidence or studies to support its assertion.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that getting a flu shot in the past ten years will lead to a positive COVID-19 test, which is a problematic assumption without any basis in reality.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by relying on discredited and untrustworthy sources, such as Dr. Rashid Buttar, who has been reprimanded by medical boards and peddled unapproved treatments.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider the alternative explanation that COVID-19 is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which is unrelated to the influenza virus.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in this claim."}
