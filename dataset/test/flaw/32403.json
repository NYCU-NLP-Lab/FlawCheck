{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the photos predate the coronavirus pandemic.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as the photos have been circulating online since at least September 2019, and there is no evidence linking them to the novel coronavirus.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the photos show Myanmar's navy shooting at Bengalis to stop them from entering Myanmar with the novel coronavirus, without providing any evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The photos have been identified as showing the Myanmar navy's activities that are unrelated to the claim made in the post."}
