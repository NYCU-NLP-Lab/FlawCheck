{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the Democrats' support for the border wall in 2006 by implying that they were \"wholeheartedly\" in favor of it.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the assertion that Democrats voted for the border wall in 2006, as it only mentions a few Democratic senators who voted for the Secure Fence Act.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Democrats' support for border fencing in 2006 is equivalent to supporting President Trump's proposed border wall.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for why Democrats might oppose the border wall, such as changes in policy priorities or disagreement with specific aspects of the proposed wall."}
