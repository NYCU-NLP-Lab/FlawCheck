{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent of the fire by stating that a room full of servers and hard drives was destroyed, whereas the expert's verdict only mentions a small fire in the ceiling of a Secret Service structure.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the FBI was on its way to the Clintons' residence when the fire occurred. The expert's verdict mentions that a conspiracy theory website claimed this, but there is no actual evidence or confirmation provided.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the fire was somehow suspicious and related to criminal activity, without any substantial evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for the fire, stating that it was a small fire that broke out in a Secret Service structure, and there is no mention of any criminal activity or involvement of the Clintons.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the fire was quickly extinguished and that no injuries were reported. The claim implies that a significant amount of damage occurred, while the expert's verdict suggests otherwise."}
