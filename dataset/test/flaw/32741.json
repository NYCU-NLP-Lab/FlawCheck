{"Understate": "The claim may understate the extent of LEGO's response to the protests, as it only mentions the temporary pause in digital marketing and does not provide information about any other actions taken by LEGO in response to the protests.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a rumor spread on social media and does not provide any concrete evidence or sources to back up the statement.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that LEGO pulled police- and White House-themed toys in direct response to the nationwide protests following George Floyd's death. However, the expert's verdict suggests that LEGO's decision to pause digital marketing was not specifically tied to the protests but rather to avoid promoting potentially insensitive content during that time.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for LEGO's actions, stating that the temporary pause in digital marketing was not a direct response to the protests but rather a precautionary measure to avoid promoting potentially insensitive content during a sensitive time."}
