{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the involvement of marijuana in fatal vehicle accidents by stating that 25 percent of all drug-related fatal accidents involve marijuana. This is based on the expert's verdict that the statement seemed like \"too much\" to them.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a single report from the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy and does not provide further evidence or studies to back up the statistic.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the presence of marijuana in a person's system indicates impairment at the time of the accident, which is a problematic assumption according to the spokesperson for United for Care.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the involvement of marijuana in fatal vehicle accidents, such as other contributing factors like speeding, failure to obey traffic laws, or inattention, as mentioned in the study from the Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation."}
