{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that ISIS did exist when Jeb Bush's brother was president.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it fails to provide evidence or data to support the assertion that Al-Qaida in Iraq was wiped out during Jeb Bush's brother's presidency.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the absence of the name \"ISIS\" during Jeb Bush's brother's presidency means that the group did not exist, which is a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation to the claim, as evidence suggests that Al-Qaida in Iraq was weakened but not completely wiped out during Jeb Bush's brother's presidency."}
