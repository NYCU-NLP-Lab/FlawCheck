{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the negative impact of the diversity visa lottery program by stating that \"they give us their worst people\" and \"the worst of the worst\" are selected. The expert's verdict clarifies that countries do not send their people and that lottery applicants must meet minimum standards for education or work experience.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the diversity visa lottery program is a flawed system that allows the entry of \"the worst people.\" The expert's verdict highlights that individuals must pass background vetting by the U.S. government before getting a visa, indicating that the assumption made by the claim is problematic.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the assertion that the diversity visa lottery program selects \"the worst of the worst.\" The expert's verdict provides information about the program's requirements and the vetting process, suggesting that the claim lacks enough support.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the diversity visa lottery program is not run by foreign countries, as it states, \"They give us their worst people.\" The expert's verdict clarifies that the lottery is run by the United States, not foreign countries.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the positive aspects or benefits of the diversity visa lottery program by solely focusing on the negative perception of it. However, this bias is not explicitly mentioned in the expert's verdict.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not provide an alternative explanation for the diversity visa lottery program or consider other factors that may contribute to immigration issues. The expert's verdict mentions Trump's preference for a merit-based immigration system, indicating an alternative approach to immigration."}
