{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered an exaggeration because it states that \"approximately 88 percent\" of police officers and firefighters do not contribute to their pensions, implying that the vast majority of them do not contribute. However, the actual figures provided by the city pension office show that 88.4 percent of police officers and 87.7 percent of firefighters do not make direct contributions to their pensions.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the lack of direct contributions from police officers and firefighters towards their pensions is a problem. However, the expert's verdict mentions that the city had negotiated contracts in the past where the employees made concessions on wage increases in exchange for the city picking up their pension contributions. This suggests that there may be alternative arrangements in place that still contribute to their pensions indirectly.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the statement that police officers and firefighters do not contribute to their pensions. However, the expert's verdict provides data from the city pension office confirming that the majority of police officers and firefighters do not make direct contributions to their pensions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict presents an alternative explanation to the claim by mentioning that the lack of direct employee payments towards pensions is due to negotiated contracts in the past. These contracts allowed employees to accept lower wage increases in exchange for the city covering their pension contributions.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times because it does not provide a comprehensive explanation of the pension system for police officers and firefighters. The expert's verdict provides additional context and details about the negotiated contracts and the reasons behind the lack of direct contributions.", "Understate": "The claim does not appear to understate any information or present any information in a way that downplays its significance.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not contradict any known facts as it aligns with the information provided by the expert's verdict."}
