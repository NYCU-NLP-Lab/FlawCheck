{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates Donald Trump's support for the Iraq war, stating that he is \"on record as supporting it after it happened,\" when there is no evidence to support this.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any specific evidence or sources to back up the assertion that Donald Trump supported the Iraq war after it happened.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Donald Trump supported the Iraq war after it happened based on his statements about the war's success from a military standpoint and concerns about money being spent in Iraq. However, these statements do not explicitly indicate support for the war.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for Donald Trump's statements, as he expressed concerns about money being spent in Iraq and stated that he would have fought terrorism but not necessarily in Iraq. These statements suggest a nuanced position rather than outright support for the war.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there is no evidence to support the assertion that Donald Trump supported the Iraq war after it happened.", "Understate": "The claim understates the lack of evidence for Donald Trump's support of the Iraq war after it happened, as it simply states that he is \"on record\" without providing any specific instances or sources."}
