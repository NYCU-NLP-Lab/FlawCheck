{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of bird deaths caused by wind farms, stating that they kill more than 1 million birds a year, while scientific studies estimate a range of 20,000 to 573,000 bird deaths per year.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support or evidence to back up the statement that shooting an eagle would result in a five-year jail sentence.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in accurately representing the facts about bird deaths caused by wind farms, as it fails to mention that fossil-fuel plants actually kill more birds per year than wind farms.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or factors that contribute to bird deaths, such as collisions with transmission lines and towers, which are mentioned by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service."}
