{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the percentage of unemployed workers who have been unemployed for six months or longer. The expert's verdict indicates that the percentage was only 45% for a specific period of time during the Obama presidency, and for most of the presidency, the ratio was lower.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by using the wrong verb tense, suggesting that the 45% figure applies to the entire recession and the Obama presidency, when it was only true for the past three months at the time of the statement.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any specific data or sources to back up the percentage mentioned.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the percentage of long-term unemployed workers applies to the entire population of unemployed individuals, without providing any evidence or context for this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or factors that could contribute to the percentage of long-term unemployed workers, such as changes in the labor market or economic policies."}
