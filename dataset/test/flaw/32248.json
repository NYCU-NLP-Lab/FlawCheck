{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there are conflicting numbers provided by Zeldin's office and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee regarding his attendance at Veterans Affairs hearings.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that missing two-thirds of Veterans Affairs hearings is a negative thing without considering any potential reasons or circumstances for the absences.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for the conflicting numbers, as Zeldin's office and the DCCC referred to different sets of numbers, hearings, and markup sessions.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times as Zeldin is marked as present in some official transcripts for meetings that the DCCC charged him with missing, but in another transcript, he was not listed as present when his office said he was there.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Zeldin's office stated he attended nearly three-quarters of the meetings held by the committee and subcommittees to which he belongs.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate Zeldin's attendance if the DCCC's accusation of him missing two-thirds of Veterans Affairs hearings is accurate.", "Exaggerate": "There is no evidence of exaggeration in the claim."}
