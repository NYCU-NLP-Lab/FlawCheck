{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of Donald Trump in stopping millionaires from being eligible for food stamps. While the claim implies that Trump personally made the decision, the expert's verdict provides evidence that the proposed rule changes were made by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and there was no mention of Trump's direct involvement.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Donald Trump put a stop to millionaires being eligible for food stamps. The expert's verdict highlights that the proposed rule changes were not specifically aimed at lottery winners or millionaires, but rather focused on conducting income and asset tests for eligibility.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that millionaires were previously eligible for food stamps, but the expert's verdict suggests that the eligibility of millionaires was not a widespread issue. The expert's verdict provides examples of specific cases, such as Leroy Fick, who continued to receive food stamps after winning the lottery due to specific state policies.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the eligibility of millionaires for food stamps. The expert's verdict highlights that the eligibility rules were based on specific state policies and federal guidelines, rather than a deliberate decision to allow millionaires to receive food stamps."}
