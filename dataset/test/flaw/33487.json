{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that all animals currently in the shelter will be euthanized if they are not adopted. (evidence: \"Over 900 animals will be put down by September 30th.\", \"They Will Be Euthanizing All Animals Without A Home!!!\", \"What isn't adopted out will be put to sleep\")", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understating in the claim.", "Falters at times": "There is no evidence of the claim faltering at times.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to substantiate the statement that all animals will be euthanized. (evidence: \"The shelter is not publicizing this very well\", \"The Germiston SPCA is closing down due to a lack of funds\")", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the shelter will euthanize all animals if they are not adopted, without considering other options or possibilities. (evidence: \"ALL DOGS MUST BE ADOPTED OR THEY WILL BE EUTHANIZED\", \"those animals will, sadly, have to be put down\")", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is no evidence of alternative explanations being presented in the claim."}
