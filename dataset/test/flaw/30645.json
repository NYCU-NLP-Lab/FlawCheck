{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the significance of Kumaraswamy reading a newspaper during the aerial survey by suggesting that this is \"all that Kumaraswamy did\" during the survey.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Kumaraswamy was only reading newspapers during the aerial survey. There may be other activities or actions that were not captured in the video.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that reading newspapers during an aerial survey is inappropriate or indicates a lack of concern for flood victims without providing any context or justification for this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for Kumaraswamy reading a newspaper during the aerial survey that are not considered in the claim."}
