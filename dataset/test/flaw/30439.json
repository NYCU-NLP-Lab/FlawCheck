{"Lack enough support": "The claim that \"90% of policemen are for\" expanding background checks to all gun sales is supported by a single survey conducted in 2016, which may not fully represent the views of all law enforcement officers across the country.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the support for expanding background checks among law enforcement officers is representative of all policemen, without considering the potential variations in opinions among different departments or regions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the lack of support from some law enforcement officers, such as concerns about the practicality or effectiveness of expanding background checks.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential opposition or reservations that some law enforcement officers may have towards expanding background checks, as the survey only provides a snapshot of support from a limited sample of officers.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in its generalization that \"90% of policemen are for\" expanding background checks, as the survey does not capture the views of all law enforcement officers and may not be fully representative.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the survey conducted in 2016 found 88% of police officers supporting expanded background checks, not 90%.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the level of support for expanding background checks among law enforcement officers by rounding up the survey result to 90%, when it was actually 88%."}
