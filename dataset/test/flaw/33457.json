{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on Walmart's wage increase and bonuses. The expert's verdict mentions that Walmart was already planning these payments and could afford them before the tax reform, but the law fast-tracked the process. This suggests that the tax cuts may have accelerated or facilitated the wage increase and bonuses, but it does not necessarily mean that the tax cuts were the sole or primary cause.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that Walmart was already planning these payments and could afford them before the tax reform. This suggests that there may not be enough evidence to directly link the wage increase and bonuses solely to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes a direct causal relationship between the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and Walmart's wage increase and bonuses. However, the expert's verdict suggests that Walmart was already planning these payments and could afford them before the tax reform. Therefore, it may be problematic to assume that the tax cuts were the sole or primary cause of the wage increase and bonuses.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that Walmart was already planning these payments and could afford them before the tax reform. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for Walmart's wage increase and bonuses, such as pre-existing plans or other factors unrelated to the tax cuts."}
