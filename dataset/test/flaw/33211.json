{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the implication that President Trump's three eldest children are only citizens because of birthright citizenship, when in fact their citizenship is also derived from their father's citizenship.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that birthright citizenship is the sole reason for the citizenship of President Trump's children, without considering the additional eligibility criteria of having a U.S. citizen father and their parents' legal marriage.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up its assertion that birthright citizenship is the only basis for the citizenship of President Trump's children.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to acknowledge the alternative explanation that the children's citizenship is also derived from their father's citizenship, which is a valid legal basis for citizenship."}
