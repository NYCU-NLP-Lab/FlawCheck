{"Contradict fact": "The claim that it was legal to mail children in 1913 contradicts the expert's verdict that it was never officially legal.", "Understate": "The claim may be considered an understatement since it only mentions that it was legal in 1913, without acknowledging that it was never legal at any time.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only provides photographs of \"mailed\" children but does not provide any concrete evidence or sources to back up the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that because there were instances of children being \"mailed\" in 1913, it must have been legal. However, the expert's verdict clarifies that it was not officially legal and that it was a result of a lack of specific laws addressing the issue.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or possibilities for why children were \"mailed\" in 1913, such as the novelty of the parcel post service and the lack of regulations specifically addressing the mailing of children."}
