{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the potential of semen as a cure for COVID-19 by stating it can be used as a hand sanitizer and ingested.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient scientific evidence or support to back up the assertion that semen can cure COVID-19.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the presence of spermine in semen can destroy and kill viruses, without considering the broader context of how viruses infect cells.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the findings of a scientific study, as stated by the authors themselves, who state that their work has nothing to do with semen or COVID-19.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The authors of the study provide an alternative explanation, stating that polyamines found in semen actually support virus infection rather than acting as a cure.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by relying on copied information from a different study about chikungunya and Zika viruses, which is not directly related to COVID-19.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in this claim."}
