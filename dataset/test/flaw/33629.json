{"Understate": "The claim understates the actions taken by former President Barack Obama regarding Russia meddling in the 2016 election. The expert's verdict provides evidence of the Department of Homeland Security and Office of the Director of National Intelligence's joint statement, as well as the declassified report, which demonstrate that Obama's administration did take action in response to the Russian interference.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it fails to provide any evidence or specific examples to back up the assertion that Obama \"did nothing\" about Russia meddling. The expert's verdict, on the other hand, provides specific statements and reports from the intelligence community that contradict the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Obama's lack of public statements or actions during a specific period of time means he did nothing about Russia meddling. However, the expert's verdict highlights the intelligence community's findings and actions taken by Obama's administration, suggesting that there may be alternative explanations for the perceived inaction.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that there may be alternative explanations for Obama's actions or lack thereof during the specified period. It provides evidence of the intelligence community's findings and actions taken by Obama's administration, indicating that there were ongoing efforts to address the Russian interference."}
