{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the threat of Antifa planning false flag violence disguised as Trump supporters. The expert's verdict states that the flyer claiming this is a hoax and has been circulating online since at least 2017.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to substantiate the assertion that Antifa is gearing up for false flag violence. The expert's verdict mentions that the claim relies on an old, fake flyer with a debunked claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Antifa activists plan to commit violence disguised as Trump supporters in order to make the case against Donald Trump. However, the expert's verdict states that Antifa is a loose coalition of left-wing activists who protest white supremacy and other far-right causes, and most of their activity is nonviolent.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the flyer, such as it being shared as a joke or satire. The expert's verdict mentions that the flyer was shared in a Facebook group called \"Hickman County Antifa,\" which was a satire page according to the user who originally posted it."}
