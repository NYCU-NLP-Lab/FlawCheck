{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which Michael Kors uses fur from dogs that were skinned alive. While the claim states that Michael Kors uses fur from dogs that were skinned alive, it does not provide sufficient evidence or support to confirm this.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that Michael Kors uses fur from dogs that were skinned alive. The evidence provided is in the form of a deleted petition and an undercover investigation by PETA, but there is no additional corroborating evidence or sources.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Michael Kors is directly involved in using fur from dogs that were skinned alive without providing concrete evidence or proof of their involvement. It is important to note that the claim relies on allegations and investigations, which may not necessarily reflect the reality of the situation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations or factors that contribute to the sourcing and manufacturing of Michael Kors products. The claim does not explore or consider any other possibilities or explanations for the use of fur in their products.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there is no evidence or content on PETA's Twitter timeline about products made from dog fur or Michael Kors. This suggests that the petition may not have originated from PETA, casting doubt on the claim's credibility.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the potential impact and consequences of using fur from dogs that were skinned alive. While the claim describes the suffering and cruelty involved in the process, it does not fully convey the gravity of the situation or the ethical implications of such practices.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in terms of providing consistent and reliable evidence or information. It relies on a deleted petition, an undercover investigation, and limited details about the specific practices and processes involved in sourcing fur from dogs."}
