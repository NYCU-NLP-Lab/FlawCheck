{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the situation by stating that the U.N. declared war on the U.S. over President Trump's vow to refuse entry to migrants traveling with a caravan. In reality, the U.N. did not declare war but rather expressed their view on the situation.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to substantiate the assertion that the U.N. declared war on the U.S. There is no credible source or official statement confirming such a declaration.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the U.N.'s statement regarding migrants' rights to seek asylum and international protection translates to a declaration of war. This assumption is unfounded and misrepresents the U.N.'s position.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the U.N. did not declare war on the U.S. The expert's verdict clearly states that the U.N. has not made such a declaration.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by misinterpreting the U.N.'s statement and distorting it into a declaration of war. It fails to accurately represent the U.N.'s position on the matter.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the U.N.'s statement, such as their commitment to upholding international law and protecting the rights of migrants in accordance with established protocols."}
