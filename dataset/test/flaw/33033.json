{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the difference between the penalties for carrying pot and carrying a gun illegally by stating that a second arrest for carrying pot is always a felony and a second or subsequent arrest for carrying a gun illegally is always a misdemeanor. The reality is that prosecutors have discretion in charging and may choose to issue a ticket instead of a felony charge for carrying pot.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the penalties for carrying pot and carrying a gun illegally should be the same, which may be a problematic assumption as the laws and societal views on these substances may differ.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific evidence or data to support the assertion that carrying a gun illegally is consistently treated as a misdemeanor for second or subsequent offenses in Wisconsin.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the difference in penalties, such as the potential differences in societal harm or the intent behind the offenses."}
