{"Understates": "The expert's verdict acknowledges that some COVID-19 vaccine doses were thrown away, but emphasizes that it was not a widespread issue and that the instances were the result of strict distribution rules and a lack of guidance. This could be seen as an understatement of the extent of the problem.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that it is unclear how many doses of the COVID-19 vaccine were discarded. This indicates a lack of concrete data or evidence to fully support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The expert's verdict mentions that in some cases, vials were disposed of because combining fluid from multiple vials could prove unsafe or ineffective. This assumption that combining fluid from multiple vials could be problematic is not fully supported or explained.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that some vials contained more doses than originally thought, and because regulatory guidance was not established early on as to how to administer these extra doses or because not enough qualified vaccine recipients could be found in time, some fluid was disposed of. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the throwing away of vaccine doses, such as logistical challenges or lack of proper protocols."}
