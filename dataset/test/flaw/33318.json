{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Donald Trump did not have a portable oxygen concentrator when he left the White House for the hospital.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a now-suspended Twitter account that published photos without providing substantial evidence.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Donald Trump had a portable oxygen concentrator in his pocket with the nasal cannula going up his back, hidden in his hair and tucked under his mask, without providing any concrete evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There are alternative explanations for the photos, as other angles of Trump's walk from the White House to Marine One do not support the conspiracy theory."}
