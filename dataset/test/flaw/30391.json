{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the risk by stating that black women are \"320% more likely to die from complications in childbirth.\" The actual statistic is that non-Hispanic black women are 3.3 times as likely as non-Hispanic white women to die from complications in childbirth.", "Lack enough support": "Although the claim is supported by data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report, it would be helpful to have more recent and comprehensive data to fully support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the racial disparity in maternal mortality rates is solely due to racial bias in the healthcare system, without considering other potential factors that may contribute to the gap.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider other potential factors such as socioeconomic status, access to healthcare, and underlying health conditions that may contribute to the disparity in maternal mortality rates.", "Falters at times": "The claim may be seen as faltering in its phrasing by stating that black women are \"320% more likely to die,\" which could be misinterpreted. The more accurate statement would be that black women are 3.3 times as likely to die compared to white women.", "Understate": "The claim does not understate the severity of the issue, as it accurately highlights the significant disparities in maternal mortality rates between black and white women."}
