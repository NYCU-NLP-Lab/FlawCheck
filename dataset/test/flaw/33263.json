{"Exaggerate": "The claim of a \"sea monster of giant size\" spotted near Antarctica could be seen as an exaggeration, as there is no concrete evidence to support such a claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the existence of a sea monster. The only evidence provided is a video posted on YouTube, which is later debunked.", "Problematic assumption": "The assumption that the sighting could be a sea monster is problematic, as there is no scientific basis or evidence to support the existence of such creatures.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The alternative explanation given by the expert is that the \"unknown object\" seen in the video is actually a rock, specifically Sail Rock, a small volcano located at the same coordinates. This suggests that there is an alternative explanation for the sighting, contradicting the claim of a sea monster."}
