{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the situation by stating that poll challengers were \"locked out\" and that windows were \"covered.\" The expert's verdict clarifies that challengers from both sides were locked out because the limit had already been exceeded, and the windows were partially obstructed, not completely covered.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement in the claim or the expert's verdict.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to fully substantiate the assertion that poll challengers were locked out and windows were covered. The expert's verdict provides additional context and information about the situation, which suggests that the claim may not accurately represent the entire scenario.", "Problematic assumption": "There is no clear problematic assumption in the claim or the expert's verdict.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides alternative explanations for the situation, such as concerns about COVID-19 spreading, building security, and tension as challengers continued to arrive. These factors may have contributed to the decisions made regarding the number of challengers allowed and the partial obstruction of windows.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not contradict any facts provided in the expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "There is no indication that the claim falters at times or presents inconsistent information."}
