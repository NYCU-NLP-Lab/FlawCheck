{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the percentage of Floridians who owe more on their homes than they are worth by stating that \"nearly half\" or 46 percent of Floridians are in this situation. This is higher than the national average of 22-27 percent.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only provides one source, CoreLogic Inc., which reports a rate of 45.1 percent. While this is a reputable source, it would be beneficial to have additional sources to strengthen the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the high percentage of underwater mortgages in Florida, such as the impact of the housing bubble and economic factors specific to the state.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the national average for underwater mortgages is around 22-27 percent, depending on the source. The claim states that Florida's figure would be almost twice the national average.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing a clear and concise explanation of the housing crisis and its impact on the percentage of underwater mortgages in Florida. It includes quotes from the Democratic Party chairman but does not provide a comprehensive analysis."}
