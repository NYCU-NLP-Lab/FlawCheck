{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as the expert's verdict states that the Justice Department website showed only 39 voting rights cases under Obama, while the claim states that there were more than 100 cases.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of voting rights cases taken on by the Justice Department is a measure of their commitment to combating voter suppression, without considering other factors or alternative explanations.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the Justice Department website shows a smaller number of voting rights cases (39) compared to the claim of more than 100 cases.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerated as the actual number of voting rights cases taken on by the Justice Department is disputed and appears to be lower than the claim suggests.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times as it relies on a statement made by President Obama without thoroughly fact-checking the accuracy of the information.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict highlights an alternative explanation provided by the Heritage Foundation, which points to a DOJ list of voting section litigation cases that included 41 cases filed since 2009."}
