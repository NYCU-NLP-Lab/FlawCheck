{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the number of millionaires who \"gamed the system\" to pay no income taxes. The expert's verdict states that the original figure of 7,000 millionaires has been revised down to 4,000, and even further to 1,470 or 1,403 based on different measures.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support to prove that 7,000 millionaires specifically \"gamed the system\" to avoid paying income taxes. The evidence provided is based on estimates and taxpayer data, rather than concrete evidence.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all 7,000 millionaires who paid no income taxes did so by \"gaming the system.\" However, the expert's verdict does not provide any evidence or analysis to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why millionaires may not have paid income taxes. The expert's verdict mentions that the \"cash income\" measure used includes non-taxable compensation like employer-provided health insurance, which may contribute to the number of millionaires not paying taxes.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in its accuracy and specificity. The expert's verdict states that the millionaires part of the claim is correct, but the middle-class part is less clear. This suggests that the claim may not accurately represent the full picture.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understating biases in the provided claim.", "Contradict fact": "There is no evidence of contradicting facts in the provided claim."}
