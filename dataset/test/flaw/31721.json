{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which Kevin Cramer wants to cut Social Security and Medicare to pay for tax cuts. While Cramer has mentioned the need for reform and shoring up these programs, there is no explicit statement indicating his intention to cut them.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Cramer's vote for the tax plan automatically means he wants to cut Social Security and Medicare to pay for it. However, there is no direct evidence or statement from Cramer supporting this assumption.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support to prove that Cramer wants to cut Social Security and Medicare. The evidence provided includes interviews where Cramer talks about the need for reform and shoring up these programs, but there is no clear indication of his intention to cut them.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that changes or \"cuts\" to Medicare and Social Security are not solely due to the deficit increase caused by the tax law. There are other factors contributing to the need for reform, suggesting that there may be alternative explanations for Cramer's stance on these programs.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing a clear and direct connection between Cramer's vote for the tax plan and his supposed intention to cut Social Security and Medicare. The evidence provided includes interviews where Cramer talks about the need for reform, but it does not definitively support the claim.", "Contradict fact": "There is no clear contradiction of fact in the claim. However, the evidence provided does not strongly support the claim either."}
