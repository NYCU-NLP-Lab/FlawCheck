{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that the video shows the U.S.-ordered drone strike that killed Iran Gen. Qassem Soleimani, when in fact it is a clip from a mobile video game.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or sources to back up the assertion that the video is genuine.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video circulating on social media is an authentic representation of the drone strike, without verifying its source or authenticity.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the video is not a genuine recording of the drone strike, but rather a clip from a video game.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the origin of the video, such as it being a hoax or a deliberate misinformation campaign."}
