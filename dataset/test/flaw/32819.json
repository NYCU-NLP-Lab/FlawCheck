{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the disparity between the arrest rates of black and Latino people compared to white people for marijuana usage. While the claim states that black and Latino people are arrested at ten times the rate of white people, the data provided indicates that 86% of those arrested were either black or Hispanic, while only 9% were white. This suggests a significant disparity, but not necessarily a tenfold difference.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific evidence or additional supporting data beyond the statistics provided. While the data from the state Division of Criminal Justice Services confirms the claim to some extent, it does not provide a comprehensive analysis of all marijuana-related arrests in New York City. The claim could benefit from additional sources or data to strengthen its support.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the rate of marijuana usage is virtually the same among black, Latino, and white populations in NYC. While the claim states \"for virtually the same rate of marijuana usage,\" it does not provide evidence or data to support this assumption. It is possible that different racial or ethnic groups have varying rates of marijuana usage, which could influence the arrest rates.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the disparity in arrest rates. It does not explore other factors that may contribute to the higher arrest rates for black and Latino people, such as biased policing practices or systemic racism."}
