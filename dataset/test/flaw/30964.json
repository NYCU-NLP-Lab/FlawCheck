{"Understate": "The claim may understate the impact of the new guidelines by simply stating that they \"eliminate\" the CDC as the leader of data collection. The expert's verdict provides more context and explains that the guidelines modified the way medical facilities report COVID-19 patient data and the pandemic's impact on them.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific evidence or sources to support the assertion that the Trump administration established new guidelines for hospitals to report COVID-19 patient information. However, the expert's verdict provides a summary of a memo from the U.S. Health and Human Services Department that supports the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the new guidelines were implemented under the direction of U.S. President Donald Trump. While the claim does mention that it was alleged that Trump directed the change, it does not provide concrete evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the change in guidelines, such as potential reasons or motivations behind the decision.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not contradict any known facts.", "Exaggerate": "The claim does not appear to exaggerate the impact of the new guidelines.", "Falters at times": "The claim does not appear to falter at times."}
