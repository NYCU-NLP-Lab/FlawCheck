{"Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Kabir, Nanak, and Goraknath \"sat together\" and discussed spirituality, without providing sufficient evidence or historical proof for this assertion.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough supporting evidence or historical documentation to substantiate the claim that Kabir, Nanak, and Goraknath had a meeting and discussed spirituality.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The historical records and scholarly research suggest that Kabir and Nanak were contemporaries and had similarities in their teachings, but there is no evidence to support the claim that Goraknath was present at the same time or participated in the discussion.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the historical timeline of Goraknath, who is believed to have lived in the 12th century CE, while Kabir and Nanak lived in the 15th and 16th centuries CE respectively."}
