{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the wealth of the Walton family by stating that they control a fortune equal to the wealth of the bottom 42 percent of Americans combined. The expert's verdict mentions that the Walton family's wealth was as large as the wealth of the bottom 48.8 million families in the United States, or 41.5 percent of all American families, which suggests a slightly lower percentage.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific data or evidence to support the comparison between the Walton family's wealth and the wealth of the bottom 42 percent of Americans.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the wealth of the Walton family is directly comparable to the wealth of the bottom 42 percent of Americans, without considering factors such as debt or net worth.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that Walmart is not family-owned but owned by its stockholders. While the Walton family still has control of the company, the claim may overlook this distinction and imply direct ownership of Walmart by the family.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Walmart is not family-owned but owned by stockholders.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the wealth of the Walton family by not considering the increase in their wealth over time, as mentioned in the expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "There is no clear evidence in the expert's verdict that the claim falters at times."}
