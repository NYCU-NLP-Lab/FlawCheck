{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent of the alleged vote switching, as the expert states that the reports from 2012 were \"more benign\" and not indicative of a widespread voter fraud effort.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to substantiate the assertion that votes cast for Mitt Romney were switched to President Obama.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that votes were intentionally switched, without providing evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert suggests that the reported incidents of miscalibrated touch screens in 2012 could explain the discrepancies in the voting process, rather than intentional vote switching."}
