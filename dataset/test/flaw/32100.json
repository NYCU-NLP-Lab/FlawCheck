{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the impact of Americans crashing Canada's immigration website immediately after Donald Trump was elected. While it is true that the website experienced difficulties and a significant increase in traffic, the claim may overstate the extent to which Americans were responsible for the crash.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or data to conclusively prove that Americans were solely responsible for crashing the website. It only mentions that a \"flood\" of visitors from the United States was what had crashed the site.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim may make a problematic assumption that the crash of Canada's immigration website was directly caused by Americans searching for ways to get out of the country after Donald Trump was elected. The expert's verdict mentions that the crash was a result of a significant increase in traffic, but it does not explicitly attribute the cause to Americans or their reaction to the election.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may exist alternative explanations for the crash of Canada's immigration website, such as technical infrastructure problems that have plagued the Canadian government for several years. The expert's verdict mentions these previous issues, suggesting that the crash could be attributed to broader technical difficulties rather than solely to Americans.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times as it does not provide a clear timeline or specific details about the crash. The expert's verdict mentions similar rumors circulating during primary elections in March 2016, suggesting that the website may have experienced issues before the U.S. election.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not necessarily contradict any known facts, as it acknowledges that the website experienced difficulties. However, it may be misleading in attributing the crash solely to Americans without sufficient evidence.", "Understate": "The claim does not appear to understate any information or downplay the significance of the crash."}
