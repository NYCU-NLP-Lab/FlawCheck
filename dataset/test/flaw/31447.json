{"Exaggerate": "The claim suggests that CNN asked a survivor to deliver scripted remarks during a televised town hall, which implies a level of manipulation and control over the survivor's words. However, the expert's verdict and the statement from CNN deny this accusation, indicating that the claim may be exaggerated.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times because it relies solely on the account of one survivor, Colton Haab, who accused CNN of scripting his remarks. However, the expert's verdict and CNN's statement contradict Haab's claim, suggesting that there may be inconsistencies in the survivor's account.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only provides the account of one survivor, Colton Haab, without presenting any additional evidence or testimonies. This lack of support weakens the credibility of the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that CNN asked a survivor to deliver scripted remarks without providing substantial evidence to support this assumption. It relies solely on the account of one survivor, which may be seen as a problematic assumption without further corroboration.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why the survivor, Colton Haab, may have felt that his remarks were scripted. It is possible that there was a misunderstanding or miscommunication between Haab and CNN, which could provide an alternative explanation for his perception of scripted remarks."}
