{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the potential impact of the spending cuts by stating that 43,000 people will be kicked out of nursing homes or denied entrance. The expert's verdict mentions that the exact number of residents who would be affected is elusive.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the potential impact of the spending cuts by not considering the projected increases in health care costs or in Medicaid-supported nursing home residents. The expert's verdict mentions that the actual daily rates would effectively drop 34 percent, which is not mentioned in the claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific evidence or data to support the statement that 43,000 people will be affected. The expert's verdict mentions that the number of residents who would be kicked out or denied care is elusive.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the spending cuts in the Texas House version of the state budget will directly result in 43,000 people being kicked out of nursing homes or denied entrance. The expert's verdict mentions that the association estimates the potential impact based on data from 2008, which may not accurately reflect the current situation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or factors that could contribute to the potential impact on nursing homes and residents. The expert's verdict mentions that Medicaid reimbursement rates have increased multiple times and that the state's reimbursement rate is already low compared to the national average."}
