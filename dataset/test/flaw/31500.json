{"Lack enough support": "The claim that black police officers are more likely to kill black people is based on limited data and is not supported by a comprehensive study.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the limited data available shows that black police officers are more likely to kill black people, but acknowledges that there are factors that could skew the result.", "Falters at times": "The study's authors note that the race of the officer who caused the death was not known in the majority of cases, which weakens the claim's validity.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The study suggests that the media may underreport the officer's race when black officers are involved, which could affect the results and provide an alternative explanation for the observed ratios.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict contradicts the claim by stating that white police officers are not significantly more likely to kill a black suspect when accounting for factors like the violent crime rate or demographics.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity of the issue by oversimplifying it to the race of the officers involved, without considering other factors that may contribute to police shootings."}
