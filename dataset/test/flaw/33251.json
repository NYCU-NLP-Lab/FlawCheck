{"Falters at times": "The claim falters at times because it does not provide specific evidence or data to support the statement that \"at least 40 percent of my supporters said, oh, they weren't going to support Sen. Obama.\"", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support because it does not provide additional evidence or data to back up the assertion that 40 percent of Clinton supporters did not support Obama.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the 40 percent of Clinton supporters who did not support Obama, such as different wording in the polls or different circumstances in the 2008 election compared to the current election.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that subsequent polling data showed Obama eventually won the support of Clinton backers, suggesting that the claim may be overstating the extent of Clinton supporters who did not support Obama.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the support that Clinton is currently receiving from Sanders voters compared to Obama's support from Clinton backers in 2008. The article states that Clinton is already doing about 10 points better in securing the backing of Sanders voters than Obama did with Clinton backers.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the impact of the 40 percent of Clinton supporters who did not support Obama, as subsequent polling data showed that Obama still won the support of a majority of Clinton backers."}
