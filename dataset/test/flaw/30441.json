{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on conflicting information from different sources, including the CBSE mark sheet, voter information, and Aadhaar card.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the voter details provide conclusive proof of the shooter's age, which is a problematic assumption considering the conflicting information and ongoing verification process.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation that the shooter may have used false information or someone else's identity for voter registration, leading to a mismatch in the father's name between different sources.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the CBSE mark sheet suggests the shooter is a minor, while the voter details indicate otherwise.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict mentions that one of the individuals who initially claimed the shooter is an adult later took down their tweet, suggesting a possible falter or inconsistency in their statement.", "Exaggerate": "There is no clear evidence of exaggeration in the claim."}
