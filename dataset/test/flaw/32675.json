The expert's verdict challenges this assumption by providing evidence of cases where voter fraud allegations were examined and dismissed.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the importance of standing as the sole reason for cases being thrown out, without considering other factors such as evidence or lack thereof.
