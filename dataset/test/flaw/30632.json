{"Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that they reached out to the Republican National Committee and the House Republican Conference for specific information on congressional policies that mirror Trump's immigration proposals, but did not receive a response. This lack of response indicates a lack of support for the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that President-elect Trump's immigration policies are very similar to policies that are currently in the Senate and the House, without providing concrete evidence or examples to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that during the presidential campaign, Trump disagreed with House Speaker Paul Ryan and other Republicans on various issues. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations or differences in immigration policies between Trump and the Republican-controlled Senate and House.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict mentions that Trump was inconsistent in his plans for dealing with the estimated 11 million people in the country illegally, which contradicts the claim that his immigration policies are very similar to those in the Senate and the House.", "Understate": "The expert's verdict does not mention any instances where Trump's immigration policies may go beyond what is currently proposed in the Senate and the House, potentially understating the differences between them.", "Exaggerate": "The expert's verdict does not provide any evidence of exaggeration in the claim."}
