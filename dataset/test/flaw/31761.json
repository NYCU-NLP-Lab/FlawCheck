{"Exaggerate": "The claim of low ridership in the Denver light rail system is exaggerated based on the expert's verdict. The expert mentions that the system averages about 84,000 trips per day, which is a significant number and contradicts the claim of low ridership based on a few photos.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Denver's light rail system consistently ranks in the top 10 light rail systems in the country in terms of ridership. The expert provides evidence that Denver's system is actually quite successful compared to other cities.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is solely based on a few photos presented by the spokesperson. The expert's verdict provides more comprehensive data on the ridership of the Denver light rail system, which contradicts the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that low ridership can be determined solely based on a few photos of empty stations and rail cars. However, the expert's verdict highlights the larger context, including the system's overall ridership numbers and its ranking compared to other cities.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the photos of empty stations and rail cars. The expert's verdict mentions factors such as the Great Recession and changes in regulations that may have impacted ridership temporarily."}
