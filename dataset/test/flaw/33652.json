{"Exaggerate": "The expert's verdict may exaggerate the significance of recent positive developments in the United States' relationship with Iran in proving Obama's position right and Clinton's wrong.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict may lack enough support to conclusively prove that Obama was right and Clinton was wrong based solely on recent positive developments in the United States' relationship with Iran.", "Problematic assumption": "The expert's verdict assumes that recent positive developments in the United States' relationship with Iran are solely attributable to Obama's position and not influenced by other factors.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict does not consider alternative explanations for recent positive developments in the United States' relationship with Iran, such as changes in Iranian leadership or geopolitical shifts.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict contradicts the claim that Hillary Clinton called Barack Obama \"naive\" for saying he would \"sit down and talk to the Iranians\" during the 2008 Democratic primary. The expert acknowledges that Clinton's comment was in response to a specific question about meeting with leaders of Iran and other countries without preconditions, not solely about talking to the Iranians."}
