{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent to which President Obama is not paying women equally in his own White House. The expert's verdict mentions a gender pay gap in the White House, but the difference in average pay is stated to be around 10 percent, which may not necessarily indicate intentional discrimination.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support to conclusively prove that President Obama is not paying women equally. The expert's verdict mentions a gender pay gap in the White House, but it does not provide further evidence or analysis to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that President Obama is not paying women equally based on the gender pay gap in the White House. However, the expert's verdict does not provide evidence or analysis to determine the reasons behind the pay gap, such as whether it is due to discriminatory practices or other factors.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the gender pay gap in the White House. The expert's verdict mentions that the pay gap exists, but it does not explore other possible factors or reasons for the gap.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the statement made by White House adviser Valerie Jarrett, who said that in the White House, women do earn equal pay for equal work. The expert's verdict includes Jarrett's statement, which contradicts the claim.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the significance of the gender pay gap in the White House. The expert's verdict mentions a difference of around 10 percent in average pay between men and women, which could be considered significant, but the claim does not emphasize this aspect.", "Falters at times": "It is unclear if the claim falters at times since the expert's verdict does not provide specific evidence or analysis to support this bias. Further information would be needed to determine if the claim falters in any way."}
