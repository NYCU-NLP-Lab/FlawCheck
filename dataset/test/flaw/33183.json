{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the prevalence of package theft by stating that \"as many as one in four people have had a package stolen from their residence.\" The study cited in the claim actually found that 24% of online shoppers surveyed had personally experienced package theft, which is not necessarily representative of the entire population.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it only references one study conducted by Shorr Packaging Corp. While this study provides some data on package theft, it may not be comprehensive or representative enough to support the claim that one in four people have had a package stolen.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the prevalence of package theft is directly linked to the shift toward purchasing products online. While the study mentioned in the claim focuses on online shoppers, it does not establish a causal relationship between online shopping and package theft.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the reported package theft, such as the specific neighborhoods or areas where the survey respondents reside. Factors like location and local crime rates could significantly influence the likelihood of package theft.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by providing additional information that may not directly support the assertion of one in four people experiencing package theft. For example, it includes statistics on precautions taken by online shoppers to prevent theft and the popularity of video doorbells, which are not directly related to the claim itself."}
