{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate Trump's promise by stating that he \"promised\" a COVID-19 vaccination would be readily available by Nov. 3, 2020, when in fact he never explicitly made such a promise.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the extent of Trump's statements about the possibility of a vaccine being available before Nov. 3, as he repeatedly mentioned the potential for a vaccine to be available \"very soon\" or \"right around that time.\"", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to substantiate the assertion that Trump promised a COVID-19 vaccination by Nov. 3, as the expert's verdict states that Trump did not explicitly make such a promise.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Trump's references to a vaccine being available \"very soon\" or \"right around that time\" equate to a promise that it would be available by Nov. 3, which may be a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation could be that Trump's references to a vaccine being available \"very soon\" or \"right around that time\" were not meant as a promise but rather as an expression of optimism or hope."}
