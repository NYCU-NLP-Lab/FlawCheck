{"Understate": "The claim may be understating the number of cases being filed in the courts every year. The expert's statement mentions that they only dispose of about 300,000 cases, which suggests that the actual number of cases filed may be higher than 400,000.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the statement that there are an average of 400,000 cases being filed in the courts every year. The expert's statement does not provide any specific sources or data to back up this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of cases being filed in the courts is directly related to the number of judges and magistrates available. The expert's statement mentions that there is a 'global average' for the number of judges and magistrates to the number of people, but this does not necessarily mean that the number of cases filed is solely dependent on the number of judges and magistrates.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the number of cases being filed in the courts. The expert's statement mentions that there is only one judge serving over 300,000 people and one magistrate serving over 77,000 people, which could suggest that the workload for judges and magistrates is high, leading to a higher number of cases being filed. However, other factors such as the efficiency of the judicial system, access to justice, and socio-economic factors may also contribute to the number of cases filed."}
