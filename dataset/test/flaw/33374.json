{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered exaggerated as it states that \"one out of four corporations doesn't pay a nickel in taxes,\" implying that a significant number of corporations completely avoid federal income taxes.", "Understate": "The claim may also be considered understated as a Government Accountability Office (GAO) study from 2008 found that for large U.S.-controlled corporations, one out of four paid no taxes. This suggests that the actual number of corporations not paying federal income taxes may be higher than what the claim states.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it does not provide specific data or sources to back up the statement that one out of four corporations do not pay federal income taxes.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the reason for corporations not paying taxes is due to special deals in the tax code. However, the GAO study mentioned in the expert's verdict indicates that some corporations may not pay taxes due to factors such as failing to turn a profit or utilizing legal deductions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that Citizens for Tax Justice, a research group, suggests that the one-in-four statistic might be less significant than it seems. This implies that there may be alternative explanations or factors influencing the number of corporations not paying federal income taxes.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that some corporations do pay federal income taxes, as stated in the expert's verdict. The GAO study found that for large corporations, one out of four paid no taxes, indicating that the majority (three out of four) did pay taxes."}
