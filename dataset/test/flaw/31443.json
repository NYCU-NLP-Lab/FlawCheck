{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the profits of Exxon by stating that they pocketed nearly $4.7 million every hour. This could be seen as an attempt to make the profits seem larger than they actually are.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it does not provide any additional evidence or sources to back up the statement that Exxon pocketed nearly $4.7 million every hour.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the hourly profit of Exxon is the only relevant statistic to consider when evaluating their financial situation. The expert's verdict mentions that there are other statistics, such as taxes and expenses, that should also be taken into account.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that Exxon argued that the claim does not provide the full context of their financial situation, as it does not consider their expenses and taxes. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations or factors to consider when evaluating Exxon's profits."}
