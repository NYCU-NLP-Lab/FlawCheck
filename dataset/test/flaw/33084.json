{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the closeness of the race between Mitt Romney and President Obama by stating it is a \"margin-of-error race\" on the Fourth of July. This implies that the race is extremely close and could go either way, which may be an exaggeration of the actual polling data.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it does not provide specific evidence or data from polls to back up the assertion that it is a \"margin-of-error race.\" It only mentions that \"most polls\" support this claim without providing specific details or sources.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the margin of error in the polls is the only factor to consider in determining the closeness of the race. It does not take into account other factors such as voter turnout, campaign strategies, or potential shifts in public opinion.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the closeness of the race, such as the impact of campaign events, candidate performance, or other external factors that may influence polling results.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that only two out of the reviewed polls found a difference between Obama and Romney that could not be impacted by the survey's margin of error. This suggests that the claim may be overstating the closeness of the race.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times by not providing a comprehensive analysis of all available polls and their methodology. It only mentions a few specific polls that support the claim without considering the overall trend or consensus among different polls.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understating bias in the provided claim."}
