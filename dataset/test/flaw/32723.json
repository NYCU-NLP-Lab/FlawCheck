{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating Tim Kaine's stance on \"right-to-work\" laws by suggesting that he wants to thwart reform measures in Midwest battleground states. The expert's verdict mentions that Kaine's most prominent run-in with right-to-work supporters was when he nominated a former AFL-CIO director, but it does not provide enough evidence to support the claim that Kaine is actively working to thwart such reform measures.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim lacks enough support. It questions the connection between Kaine's visit to Wisconsin and his opposition to \"right-to-work\" laws, and asks for further evidence to back up the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Kaine is in lock-step with Obama to thwart pro-business, job creating right-to-work reform measures in Midwest battleground states. However, the expert's verdict does not provide enough evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that there may be alternative explanations for Kaine's visit to Wisconsin and his stance on \"right-to-work\" laws. It does not definitively state whether Kaine is an opponent or supporter of such laws, leaving room for alternative interpretations."}
