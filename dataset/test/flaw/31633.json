{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of false positives for COVID-19, suggesting that they are inflating the real danger of COVID-19 and the pandemic.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support to back up the assertion that false positives for COVID-19 are actually cases of the flu or the common cold.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that a decline in sales of the drug Tamiflu during the flu season is evidence of undiagnosed flu cases, which is a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the decline in Tamiflu sales, such as changes in healthcare-seeking behavior or the impact of COVID-19 prevention measures.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that false positives for COVID-19 do not necessarily indicate infection or contagion with SARS-CoV-2, but rather the presence of viral RNA.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in its reasoning by relying on a mischaracterization of COVID-19 PCR tests and the interpretation of Tamiflu sales data.", "Understate": "The claim understates the accuracy of COVID-19 tests by suggesting that there are unresolved questions about their accuracy in general."}
