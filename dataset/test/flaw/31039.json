{"Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity of graduation rates by only focusing on the percentage of students graduating within four years, without considering other factors such as students taking longer to complete their degrees.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support as it only provides graduation rate data from 2004 and does not consider more recent data or other factors that may affect graduation rates.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that a graduation rate of less than 50% within four years is inherently problematic without considering the specific circumstances and mission of each university.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the graduation rates, such as the preparedness and economic profiles of the students attending each university."}
