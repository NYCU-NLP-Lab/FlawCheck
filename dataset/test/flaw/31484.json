{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security orchestrated a sting against Democrats by adding a secret watermark to prove their participation in election fraud. The expert's verdict explains that the claim is a conspiracy theory pushed by QAnon personalities and die-hard supporters of Donald Trump, but there is no concrete evidence provided to support this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the federal government controls the production of ballots, which is not the case. The expert's verdict clarifies that the production of ballots is left up to the states, each of which has its own regulations and procedures. Therefore, the claim's assumption about the federal government's involvement is problematic.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the federal government is not responsible for printing or auditing the ballots. The expert's verdict explains that in most cases, private companies contracted by local election boards handle the printing of ballots. Therefore, the claim's assertion about the federal government's involvement in adding secret watermarks to ballots is contradicted by this fact.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent of the alleged conspiracy by suggesting that it would involve infiltrating thousands of different election boards or jurisdictions. The expert's verdict emphasizes that there are over 10,000 unique election administration jurisdictions in the U.S., each with their own balloting procedures. The claim's exaggeration is evident in its assumption that such a large-scale conspiracy could be orchestrated.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in the claim.", "Falters at times": "There is no indication that the claim falters at times.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not provide any alternative explanations."}
