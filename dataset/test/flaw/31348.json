{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of Joe Biden's decision in 1996 to shut down the pharmaceutical industry in Puerto Rico by stating that it was \"disastrous and heartless.\" The expert's verdict explains that while the decision did lead to job losses and economic harm, it did not completely shut down or obliterate the industry.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Joe Biden alone made the decision to shut down the pharmaceutical industry in Puerto Rico. However, the expert's verdict clarifies that Biden, as a senator, voted for a wide-ranging bill that was supported by both Democrats and Republicans. It was not solely Biden's decision.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the assertion that Joe Biden's decision in 1996 was disastrous and heartless. The expert's verdict provides context and a more nuanced understanding of the legislation and its impact on Puerto Rico's pharmaceutical industry.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Joe Biden did not single-handedly shut down the pharmaceutical industry in Puerto Rico. The expert's verdict explains that the decision was part of a larger bill that received bipartisan support.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the impact of the decision by not acknowledging that it did lead to job losses and harm Puerto Rico's economy. The expert's verdict provides a more balanced view by acknowledging the negative consequences while also providing context and alternative explanations.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the decision to phase out the tax exemption for companies manufacturing products in Puerto Rico. The expert's verdict mentions that the elimination of the provision was seen as a blow against \"corporate welfare\" and that the legislation also included other provisions such as raising the minimum wage."}
