{"Understate": "The claim may understate the actual per-student reduction in spending by stating that it is $500 less, while the expert's verdict indicates that the reduction is actually $569 on average.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or data to back up the assertion that Texas is spending $500 less per student.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that legislative cuts are the sole reason for the decrease in per-student spending, without considering other factors that may have contributed to the reduction.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that there are alternative ways to determine per-student cuts, suggesting that there may be alternative explanations for the decrease in spending that are not considered in the claim."}
