{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered as exaggerating the impact of the national debt by stating that it will reach 99.7 percent of the debt-to-GDP ratio and $47,900 for every living American.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times by not accurately representing the current debt and GDP statistics.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide sufficient evidence or sources to back up the stated figures.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that reaching $15 trillion in national debt automatically means a specific debt-to-GDP ratio and a specific amount per living American, which may be a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may exist alternative explanations or factors that could affect the debt-to-GDP ratio and the amount per living American, which are not mentioned in the claim."}
