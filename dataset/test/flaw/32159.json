{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a single picture without any additional evidence or context.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the protester from the farmers' agitation is asking for the release of pro-freedom Kashmiri leaders based on the placard he is holding, without verifying the actual intention or message of the protester.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation that the protester may be associated with the Dal Khalsa and Shiromani Akali Dal (Amritsar) group, as suggested by the presence of their name on the placard, rather than being directly related to the farmers' protest movement.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the picture is from an incident in December 2019, while the farmers' protests began in September 2020."}
