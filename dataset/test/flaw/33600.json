{"Exaggerate": "The claim in the ad may be seen as an exaggeration because it implies that Josh Mandel earned the highest possible credit ratings as state treasurer, without providing specific details or context.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any specific evidence or data to back up the statement that Mandel earned the highest possible credit ratings.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that earning the highest possible credit ratings is solely attributed to Mandel's actions as state treasurer, without considering other factors or individuals involved in maintaining those ratings.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times because it gives the impression that the credit rating had improved under Mandel, when in fact it had been in place for 16 years before he took office.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the highest possible credit ratings, such as the work of the fund managers or external factors beyond Mandel's control, which are not addressed in the claim."}
