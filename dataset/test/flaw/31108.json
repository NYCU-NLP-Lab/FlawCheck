{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of Gov. Scott Walker's budget approach by stating that he \"pushed over $500 million in debt onto our children and our grandchildren\" and that state taxpayers will have to pay \"more than $150 million in interest.\" The expert's verdict provides more context and explains that the debt restructuring saved short-term interest and helped turn a small deficit into a small surplus.", "Understate": "There is no apparent understatement bias in the provided claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times by not providing enough context and presenting a one-sided view of Gov. Scott Walker's budget approach. The expert's verdict provides additional information to address this.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or data to back up the stated figures of over $500 million in debt and over $150 million in interest. The expert's verdict provides a memo from the Legislative Fiscal Bureau that supports the claim to some extent.", "Problematic assumption": "There is no apparent problematic assumption in the provided claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Gov. Scott Walker's budget approach or the potential long-term effects of the debt restructuring. The expert's verdict provides more context and alternative perspectives on the issue."}
