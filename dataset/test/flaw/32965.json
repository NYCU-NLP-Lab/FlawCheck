{"Understate": "The claim exaggerates the powers granted to President Obama through the executive order, implying that they are unprecedented. However, the expert's verdict states that the executive order is a minor update of a similar order issued by President Bill Clinton in 1994, indicating that the claim understates the extent of the powers.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or support for its assertion that President Obama was given \"unprecedented powers in time of national emergency.\" The expert's verdict provides a detailed analysis and comparison of the executive order, highlighting that it does not grant the claimed powers. Therefore, the claim lacks enough support.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that President Obama's executive order gives him unprecedented powers, without providing substantial evidence or justification for this assumption. The expert's verdict refutes this assumption by providing historical context and comparing the executive order with previous ones, demonstrating that it is not unprecedented.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the purpose and content of the executive order. It presents a biased interpretation of the order, suggesting that it grants extraordinary powers to the President. The expert's verdict provides alternative explanations, such as the update being necessary due to changes in the Cabinet structure and the removal of references to FEMA.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the executive order issued by President Obama is not unprecedented but rather a minor update of a previous order. The expert's verdict provides evidence to support this contradiction.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the powers granted to President Obama by stating that they are \"unprecedented.\" The expert's verdict refutes this exaggeration by explaining that the executive order is a minor update and does not grant extraordinary powers.", "Falters at times": "There is no clear evidence of the claim faltering at times, as the claim is consistently biased in presenting President Obama's executive order as granting unprecedented powers. The expert's verdict consistently refutes this bias and provides a comprehensive analysis of the executive order."}
