{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the decline in wages by stating that there have been \"12 years in a row of wages declining\" when in fact wages fell in six of the 12 years, rose in four years, and remained steady in two years.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it does not provide specific data or evidence to back up the statement.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that declining wages over a 12-year period indicate a long-term economic fraying of the American dream, which may be a problematic assumption as there could be other factors affecting wages.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the fluctuations in wages, such as changes in the labor market or economic conditions.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by using misleading phrasing that implies a steady decline in wages when the data shows a more sideways trend with small fluctuations.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that wages did not decline in all 12 years, as stated by the expert analysis."}
