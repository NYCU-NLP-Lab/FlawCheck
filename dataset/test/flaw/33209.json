{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that former President Barack Obama \"will be on new $1 dollar bill\" when there are no plans to redesign the $1 bill and living people are not permitted to be on currency notes.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no factual evidence or official announcement to support the claim that Obama will be on the $1 bill.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that Obama will replace George Washington on the $1 bill, which is not supported by any official sources.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there are no plans to redesign the $1 bill and living people are not allowed to be featured on currency notes.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation provided by the U.S. Bureau of Engraving and Printing, which states that there are no plans to redesign the $1 bill due to it being seldom targeted for counterfeiting and the cost associated with upgrading bill readers for vendors."}
