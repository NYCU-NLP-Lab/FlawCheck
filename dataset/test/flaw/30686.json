{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the video shows a 50-foot-long giant squid that washed up on a beach in New Zealand in 2015. The expert's verdict reveals that the video is fake and the scene was not filmed anywhere near New Zealand.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the size of the squid, stating that it is 50 feet long, while the expert's verdict reveals that the video is fake and the image of the squid was created by cropping and replacing a humpback whale.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a video that is proven to be fake and not filmed in New Zealand.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video is genuine and accurately depicts a giant squid washing up on a beach in New Zealand, which is a problematic assumption as the video is proven to be fake.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by revealing that the image in the video is actually of a humpback whale that washed ashore in Canada, not a giant squid in New Zealand."}
