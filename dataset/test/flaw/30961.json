{"Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that President Obama initially had concerns about wiretappings but changed his stance after becoming president and receiving briefings. This assumption may be problematic as it is not supported by any evidence or specific examples.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the assertion that President Obama changed his stance on wiretappings after becoming president.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for President Obama's change in stance on wiretappings, such as new information or a different understanding of national security priorities. The claim does not consider these alternative explanations.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in its argument by not providing a clear and consistent explanation for President Obama's shift in stance on wiretappings.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which President Obama changed his stance on wiretappings. It presents a contrasting view without providing enough evidence to support the claim.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the potential impact or consequences of wiretappings, as it suggests that the balance between privacy and security is appropriately struck without providing sufficient evidence or analysis."}
