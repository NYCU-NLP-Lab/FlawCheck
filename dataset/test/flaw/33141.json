{"Lack enough support": "The claim that there are fewer mass shootings under Trump is based on a chart that only includes data up until February 2018, reflecting less than half of Trump's time in office. This limited data does not provide enough support for the claim.", "Falters at times": "The chart used to support the claim is flawed and inconsistent. The LA Times timeline it is based on did not define clear criteria for inclusion, and the chart itself added some shootings while ignoring others.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of mass shootings is solely dependent on the actions of the president. It does not take into account other factors that may contribute to the occurrence of mass shootings.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the decrease in mass shootings, such as changes in gun control policies or other societal factors.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the number of mass shootings under Trump by only including those that fit a specific definition (e.g., three or more killings in a single episode).", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there have been multiple high-profile mass shootings during Trump's presidency, as mentioned in the provided evidence.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the decrease in mass shootings under Trump by not considering the full scope of available data."}
