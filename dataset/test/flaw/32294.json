{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support because it does not provide specific examples or citations of the 15 cases that supposedly support the statement.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that because the Supreme Court has said marriage is a fundamental right, it automatically includes same-sex marriage, without considering alternative interpretations or arguments.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or interpretations for the Supreme Court's statements on marriage, such as the possibility that the Court may have implicitly understood marriage to be between a man and a woman.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the Supreme Court has never explicitly stated that marriage must be between a man and a woman, as claimed by the expert.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the number of cases that support the idea that marriage is not confined to heterosexual couples, as suggested by the experts who reviewed the cases and believe there are likely more than just 15 examples."}
