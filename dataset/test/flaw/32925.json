{"Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that a major disease outbreak occurs in every election year since 2004, without providing sufficient evidence to support this assumption.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough evidence to support the assertion that disease outbreaks in election years are not natural but rather the result of a political scheme.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the COVID-19 outbreak started in 2019, not 2020 as the meme implies.", "Understate": "The claim understates the severity and virulence of the illnesses listed, as well as the fact that they affected multiple countries at various times.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the connection between disease outbreaks and election years by falsely attributing outbreaks to specific election years that do not align with the actual timeline of those outbreaks.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert suggests that the connection between disease outbreaks and election years could be coincidental, as some outbreaks started before election years and bled over into them."}
