{"Understate": "The claim may understate the amount of reserve funds that will be available by fiscal year 2013. The expert's verdict mentions that a report suggests the reserve fund will be at about $420 million, which is not mentioned in the claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or data to back up the assertion that the state will wipe through the reserve funds by fiscal year 2013.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the state will make even larger cuts to the HOPE program by fiscal year 2013, without providing any evidence or reasoning to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the state's financial situation or potential solutions other than considering new revenue sources. It presents a one-sided view without exploring other possibilities."}
