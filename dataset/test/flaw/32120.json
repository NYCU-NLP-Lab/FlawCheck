{"Lack enough support": "The claim provides no citation for the figures mentioned (60 out of 1,566 churches), making it difficult to verify the accuracy of the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of churches that opened their doors to help the flood victims is low (only 60), without considering other factors such as flood damage or logistical constraints.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there were multiple reports of churches coming to the aid of those in need in the wake of Hurricane Harvey, suggesting that the claim may be an exaggeration or an understatement.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be an exaggeration if it implies that only 60 churches out of 1,566 is an unusually low number of churches providing assistance during Hurricane Harvey.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the number of churches that opened their doors to help the flood victims if there were more than 60 churches that provided assistance, but the exact percentage is unknown.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why some churches may not have been able to open their doors, such as flood damage or logistical challenges."}
