{"Understate": "The claim that \"medical marijuana has no health risks\" is an understatement because the expert's verdict mentions that cannabis in general carries few serious health risks for adult use compared to other Schedule I drugs.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as the expert's verdict states that the World Health Organization's announcement only refers to the non-psychoactive component of cannabis (CBD) and does not address cannabis as a whole or other products derived from cannabis that contain THC.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption by implying that the World Health Organization's declaration applies to all forms of medical marijuana, whereas the expert's verdict clarifies that the announcement only pertains to CBD and not THC-containing products.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that there may be alternative explanations or considerations regarding the health risks of medical marijuana that were not addressed by the World Health Organization's announcement."}
