{"Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that there have been isolated accounts and no reporting indicating that Eddie Bauer's practice of destroying leftover products is a widespread trend. This suggests that there may not be enough evidence to support the claim that this is a common practice.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Eddie Bauer clothing stores destroy and discard leftover products instead of giving them intact to charity. However, the expert's verdict includes a statement from Eddie Bauer's spokesperson denying that cutting up and discarding jackets is company policy. This suggests that the assumption made in the claim may be problematic.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict includes a statement from Eddie Bauer's spokesperson explaining that returned products deemed unsellable are sorted at the main distribution center, and any products that can be donated or salvaged are done so. This suggests that there may be an alternative explanation for the disposal of damaged jackets mentioned in the claim."}
