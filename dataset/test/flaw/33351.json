{"Exaggerate": "The claim describes the law as \"horrible\" and suggests that it requires children to be separated from their parents once they cross the border. However, the expert's verdict clarifies that there is no such law, and the separation of children is a policy implemented by the Trump administration.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the existence of the alleged law. The expert's verdict provides information that contradicts the claim and explains the actual process of separating families at the border.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that there is a specific law mandating the separation of children from their parents, which is not accurate. This assumption is challenged by the expert's verdict, which explains the role of the Trump administration's policy in the separation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict offers an alternative explanation for the separation of families, stating that it is a result of the decision to prosecute parents for illegal border crossings. This challenges the claim's implication that the separation is solely caused by a specific law."}
