{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it is based on emails obtained by The Hollywood Reporter and a video posted by Gotham Government Relations and Communications. There is no additional evidence provided to confirm the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the actors were hired specifically to cheer for Donald Trump. It is possible that they were hired for other purposes or to provide general support at the event.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The Trump campaign denied knowing about or approving the hiring of actors, suggesting that there may be an alternative explanation for the presence of actors at the event.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the significance of the alleged hiring of actors, as it did not gain much traction at the time and was overshadowed by other news events.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the Trump campaign's denial of knowledge or approval of the hiring of actors.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerated in its presentation, as it uses phrases like \"explosive story\" and \"alleged hiring of actors\" to imply a greater impact or significance than may actually exist."}
