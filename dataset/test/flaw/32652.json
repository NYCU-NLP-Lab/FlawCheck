{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or credible sources to support the assertion that eSwatini has passed a law allowing King Mswati to marry 14-year-old virgins.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the king has the desire or intention to marry 14-year-old virgins, without providing any concrete evidence or statements from the king himself.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The existence of alternative laws, such as the Child Protection Welfare Act of 2012 and the Sexual Offences and Domestic Violence Act of 2018, suggests that there are legal protections in place for children in eSwatini, contradicting the claim.", "Contradict fact": "Statements from various experts, including Slindele Nxumalo and Percy Simelane, refute the claim and state that such a law does not exist in eSwatini.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential consequences and implications of such a law, as it only focuses on the age requirement for potential wives and does not address the broader issues of child rights and protection.", "Falters at times": "The claim includes misspelled names and inaccurate statements, such as the false claim that the king's potential wives' age needed to be reduced from 17 to 14 because girls start \"getting loose\" at the age of 15. This suggests a lack of accuracy and reliability in the claim.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the situation by using phrases like \"rape legalized for King Mswati,\" which implies a more extreme and alarming scenario than the available evidence suggests."}
