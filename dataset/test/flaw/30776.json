{"Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that there is no indication that the pollster attempted to verify the legitimacy of the claim with election officials. The claim is solely based on the pollster's own queries of voter files, which lacks sufficient support.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the identified ballots in Fulton County, Ga. are likely ineligible, without providing any evidence or verification from election officials. This assumption is problematic as it is not supported by credible sources.", "Contradict fact": "Georgia election officials have repeatedly stated that they have found no credible examples of election fraud in the state. Therefore, the claim contradicts this fact by asserting that the identified ballots could potentially impact the outcome of the election.", "Exaggerate": "The claim states that \"132,000 ballots in Fulton County, Ga. have been identified as likely ineligible,\" implying a significant number of potentially ineligible ballots. However, the expert's verdict mentions that the claim is based on the number of \"unique individuals\" listed in two queries, which results in a difference of 132,032. The claim may be exaggerating the impact of these ballots.", "Understate": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim is a \"huge leap from the facts, which are scarce.\" This suggests that the claim may be understating the lack of evidence or verification supporting the assertion of ineligible ballots.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict highlights that the claim is based on the pollster's queries of voter files, without attempting to verify the legitimacy of the claim with election officials. This suggests that there could be alternative explanations for the identified ballots, such as administrative errors or other factors not related to voter eligibility."}
