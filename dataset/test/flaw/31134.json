{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent to which Bernie Sanders is defeating Trump in every major poll, stating that it is \"often by big numbers\" and always at a larger margin than Secretary Clinton is.", "Understate": "The claim understates the delegate count and implies that Bernie Sanders is in a strong position to become the nominee, despite being behind in the delegate count by near-insurmountable numbers.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific evidence or cite any sources to support the assertion that Bernie Sanders is consistently defeating Trump in every major poll.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that polling numbers at this stage of the election cycle accurately predict the outcome of the general election, disregarding the fact that general election polls may not be indicative until the conventions are over and closer to the actual election.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why Bernie Sanders may be polling better against Trump than Hillary Clinton, such as the higher negatives of Trump and Clinton or the fact that Sanders is a relatively new figure to voters nationally."}
