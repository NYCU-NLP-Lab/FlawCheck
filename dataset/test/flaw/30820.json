{"Understate": "The claim may understate the number of judges serving the population of Kenya. The expert's verdict mentions that there is only one judge serving over 300,000 people, but it does not provide information on the total number of judges in Kenya.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to substantiate the statement that there is only one judge serving over 300,000 people. The expert's verdict does not provide specific data or evidence to confirm this claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the number of judges serving the population. The expert's verdict mentions a global average for the number of judges and magistrates to the number of people, suggesting that there might be different factors influencing the ratio in Kenya.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that having one judge serving over 300,000 people is inadequate or problematic. However, the expert's verdict does not provide a clear assessment of whether this ratio is appropriate or not.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there is an average of 400,000 cases being filed in Kenyan courts every year. This suggests that the workload on judges may be higher than implied in the claim.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the situation by presenting the ratio of one judge serving over 300,000 people without providing a broader context or comparison with other countries.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times by not providing comprehensive information about the judicial system in Kenya, such as the total number of judges and magistrates available."}
