{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the number of delegates that Ron Paul's campaign stands to send to the Republican National Convention. The expert's verdict mentions that the claim lacks evidence or elaboration to support the \"nearly 200\" count.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough evidence or support to back up the assertion of having nearly 200 bound delegates. The expert's verdict mentions that Ron Paul's campaign did not provide any elaboration or response to requests for more information.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the Associated Press, an independent monitor of delegates, pegs Ron Paul's current delegate count at 137, which contradicts the claim of nearly 200 bound delegates. This alternative explanation suggests that the claim may not be accurate.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of delegates Ron Paul's campaign stands to send to the Republican National Convention is a significant achievement that shatters predictions and shows the seriousness of their movement. However, the expert's verdict questions the validity of this assumption and highlights the lack of evidence or support for the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in terms of providing concrete evidence or support for the assertion of nearly 200 bound delegates. The expert's verdict mentions that the claim can be viewed as a prediction or boast, rather than a factually checkable statement.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact provided by the Associated Press, which states that Ron Paul's current delegate count is 137, not nearly 200. The expert's verdict highlights this contradiction and questions the accuracy of the claim.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understating bias in the claim."}
