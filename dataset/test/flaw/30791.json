{"Exaggerate": "The claim states that \"nearly 180,000 illegal immigrants with criminal records, ordered deported from our country, are tonight roaming free to threaten peaceful citizens.\" It is possible that this number is being exaggerated to create a sense of urgency and fear.", "Lack enough support": "While the claim references a report from the Center for Immigration Studies, it does not provide specific evidence or data to support the claim that 180,000 illegal immigrants with criminal records are currently roaming free. The lack of specific evidence weakens the support for the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all immigrants with criminal records who have been ordered deported are a threat to peaceful citizens. This assumption fails to consider individual circumstances and the fact that some immigrants may have completed their sentences or may not pose a threat to the community.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why immigrants with criminal records may still be in the country, such as countries refusing to accept their return or state and local jurisdictions limiting cooperation with immigration authorities.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the complexities and factors involved in determining the release or detention of immigrants with criminal records. The claim implies that all immigrants with criminal records should be detained, but there may be legitimate reasons for some individuals to be released under certain circumstances."}
