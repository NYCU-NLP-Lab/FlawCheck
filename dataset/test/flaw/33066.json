{"Understate": "The claim may be understating the issue by stating that \"two-thirds of our kids can't read at grade level.\" The expert's verdict reveals that only 36 percent of fourth graders and 34 percent of eighth graders were categorized as proficient or advanced in reading, which suggests that the problem may be even worse than the claim suggests.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to validate the assertion that \"two-thirds of our kids can't read at grade level.\" The expert's verdict reveals that the claim is based on the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) data, which categorizes students as proficient or advanced, but there is no commonly accepted definition for what \"grade level\" performance is or should be.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that being categorized as proficient on the NAEP test equates to reading at grade level. However, the expert's verdict highlights that there is no consensus on what constitutes grade level performance, and the NAEP is developed independently of specific state, district, or school requirements.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the low percentage of students categorized as proficient or advanced in reading. The expert's verdict suggests that factors such as the lack of a universally accepted definition for grade level performance and the independence of the NAEP from specific educational requirements should be taken into account when interpreting the data.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not contradict any facts, as the expert's verdict confirms that the NAEP data does show that a significant percentage of students are not categorized as proficient or advanced in reading.", "Exaggerate": "The claim does not appear to exaggerate the issue, as the expert's verdict confirms that a substantial number of students are not reading at a proficient or advanced level.", "Falters at times": "The claim does not falter at times, as it consistently states that \"two-thirds of our kids can't read at grade level.\" The expert's verdict does not indicate any inconsistencies in the claim itself."}
