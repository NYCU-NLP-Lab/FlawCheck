{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the high levels of sulphur dioxide above China are evidence of mass cremations of coronavirus victims. The reports and images provided are not verified and are based on forecasted levels rather than actual observations.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in sulphur dioxide levels is directly linked to mass cremations of coronavirus victims, without considering alternative explanations such as the burning of fossil fuels or industrial emissions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert suggests that the high levels of sulphur dioxide could be attributed to sources other than mass cremations, such as the burning of fossil fuels or industrial activities. This alternative explanation challenges the claim's assertion.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's analysis contradicts the claim by stating that the images shared as satellite images are not actually satellite images but rather results of a model. This contradicts the claim's use of the images as evidence.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the significance of the sulphur dioxide levels by associating them directly with mass cremations of coronavirus victims without sufficient evidence or verification.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in the provided claim."}
