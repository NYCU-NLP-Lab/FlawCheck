{"Lack enough support": "The claim of man-made, radioactive \"diamond batteries\" providing thousands of years of energy without a charge lacks sufficient evidence and support. The expert's verdict mentions that the concept is theoretical and still in development, with numerous challenges not discussed in viral stories.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that man-made, radioactive \"diamond batteries\" can provide thousands of years of energy without a charge, without addressing the potential problems and limitations associated with this technology.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that there are alternative explanations and technologies already employed in non diamond-based technologies for generating energy from radioactive material. This implies that the claim may not be the only solution or approach to address the issue of long-lasting energy sources.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the challenges and complexities involved in developing man-made, radioactive \"diamond batteries\" as a reliable and sustainable energy source. The expert's verdict mentions that there are myriad challenges associated with this concept, which are not discussed in the viral stories.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that man-made, radioactive \"diamond batteries\" are still in the theoretical stage of development. The expert's verdict clarifies that this technology is not yet a reality and is currently being researched.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the capabilities of man-made, radioactive \"diamond batteries\" by stating that they can provide thousands of years of energy without a charge. The expert's verdict highlights that this technology is still in the theoretical stage and does not provide enough evidence to support such a claim.", "Falters at times": "It is unclear whether the claim falters at times, as the expert's verdict does not explicitly mention any inconsistencies or weaknesses in the claim. However, the fact that the technology is still in development and faces numerous challenges suggests that there may be instances where the claim falters or lacks reliability."}
