{"Exaggerate": "The claim suggests that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) inflated COVID-19 deaths by more than 1,600%. However, the expert's verdict provides evidence that debunks this claim and suggests that it is an exaggeration.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that the report claiming the CDC inflated death counts relies on a debunked claim and is led by a person who has spread misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines. This suggests that the claim lacks enough support and credibility.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the way the CDC requires comorbidity to be reported on death certificates leads to incorrect attribution of deaths to the virus. However, the expert's verdict states that this assumption is based on a debunked claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that experts, including Dr. Anthony Fauci and the World Health Organization, have stated that COVID-19 deaths are likely undercounted. This suggests that there could be alternative explanations for the reported death counts, such as deaths being underreported rather than inflated.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the CDC's data on COVID-19 deaths and comorbidity has been misinterpreted by those claiming that it showed COVID-19 was not the cause of death in cases where comorbidity was present. The expert's verdict provides evidence that debunks this misinterpretation.", "Falters at times": "It is not explicitly mentioned in the expert's verdict whether the claim falters at times. Therefore, it is difficult to determine if this bias exists in the claim.", "Understate": "The claim does not seem to understate the extent of the CDC's alleged inflation of COVID-19 deaths. Instead, it exaggerates the percentage by which the deaths are inflated. Therefore, this bias does not exist in the claim."}
