{"Falters at times": "The claim falters at times because it refers to an incorrect species of frog as the \"Alaskan tree frog\" when there is no such species.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only provides a photograph without any additional evidence or scientific research to back up the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the photograph depicts a frozen Alaskan tree frog, but the expert's verdict suggests that it may actually depict an inanimate object.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by stating that the wood frog, not the Alaskan tree frog, is the species that can survive with most of its body water frozen."}
