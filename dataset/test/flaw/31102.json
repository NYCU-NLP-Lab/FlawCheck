{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the sad fates of the rich and powerful men from 1923 by stating that they all met at the Edgewater Beach Hotel and experienced various negative outcomes, such as bankruptcy, insanity, and suicide. However, the expert's verdict states that the introductory section about the meeting is apocryphal, and some of the entries are anachronistic.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove the sad fates of the rich and powerful men from 1923. The expert's verdict mentions that the names on the list have been distorted through mistranscription and that the events described have been altered over time.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the sad fates of the rich and powerful men from 1923 are a result of their success and wealth. However, the expert's verdict suggests that the claim is a vintage piece of glurge and that the fates of the men have been exaggerated and altered.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the fates of the rich and powerful men from 1923. The expert's verdict mentions that the claim has been through alterations, with names being added and dropped, and different morals being tacked onto the end. This suggests that the sad fates may not be solely attributed to their success and wealth."}
