{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it does not provide any evidence or data to back up the assertion that the American people will not support any action on illegal immigration until the law is enforced first.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the American people's support for addressing illegal immigration is contingent on the enforcement of existing laws, without providing any evidence to support this assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the findings of multiple polls, which show that a majority of Americans support a path to legal status for undocumented immigrants.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the lack of action on illegal immigration, such as political dynamics, conflicting policy priorities, or the influence of special interest groups.", "Understate": "The claim potentially understates the level of support for addressing illegal immigration, as it fails to acknowledge the broad public support for a path to legal status for undocumented immigrants as shown in multiple polls.", "Exaggerate": "There is no clear evidence of exaggeration in the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not providing a comprehensive and accurate representation of public opinion on the issue of illegal immigration."}
