{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the level of bipartisan support by stating that there were \"overwhelming Democrat and Republican votes\" for the legislation in question.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as the expert's analysis shows that only 12 out of the 29 bills had strong bipartisan backing, which contradicts the claim of overwhelming support.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the bipartisan nature of the Wisconsin Legislature can be determined based on the votes in two special sessions on jobs in 2011, which may not be a comprehensive representation of overall bipartisan cooperation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the bipartisan votes, such as political motivations or external factors influencing the legislators' decisions.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there was a mixed record of bipartisan votes, with some bills receiving little to no bipartisan support.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by presenting an overly optimistic view of bipartisan cooperation in the Wisconsin Legislature based on limited evidence."}
