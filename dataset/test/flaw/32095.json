{"Contradict fact": "The claim that \"This is the year Florida becomes a majority minority state\" contradicts the evidence provided by the census data, which shows that non-Hispanic whites still make up 57 percent of Florida's population as of 2012.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the current proportion of minorities in Florida by not acknowledging that they already make up approximately 43 percent of the population.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support from the evidence provided, as the census data and other evidence cited do not definitively prove that Florida is on track to become majority-minority in 2014.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or factors that could affect the demographics of Florida, such as future migration patterns or changes in birth rates.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Florida becoming a majority-minority state is important for the Democratic Party's strategy in the 2014 election, without providing sufficient reasoning or evidence to support this assumption.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not providing clear and consistent evidence to support the assertion that Florida will become a majority-minority state in 2014. The evidence provided by Grayson's office and the census data do not align, creating inconsistencies in the claim's support."}
