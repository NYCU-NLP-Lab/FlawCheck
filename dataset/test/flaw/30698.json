{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the presence of peanut oil in childhood vaccines and flu shots, suggesting that it is \"secretly\" present.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that peanut oil is present in vaccines.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increased incidence of childhood peanut allergies is solely caused by the presence of peanut oil in vaccines, without considering other potential factors.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for the increased incidence of peanut allergies, attributing it to a fallacy and citing alternative health websites as sources of the claim."}
