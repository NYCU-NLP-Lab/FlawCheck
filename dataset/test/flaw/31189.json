{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent to which only voters in Democrat counties were contacted to fix their ballots, while voters in Republican-leaning counties had no opportunity to fix their ballots.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that all counties in Pennsylvania received the same guidance to notify voters about ballot errors and allow them to cast a provisional ballot on Election Day.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the inconsistency in ballot curing strictly falls along party lines, when in fact, it is not limited to Democratic counties.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that only Democrat counties were given certain privileges and that it was done to favor the Democratic Party.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the alternative explanation that counties that refused to cure ballots were following state law and a state Supreme Court ruling that prohibited it."}
