The expert's verdict includes statements from Pakistani officials and analysts, as well as data from information services firm CEIC Data, which all indicate that there are no oil supplies from Iran to Pakistan.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Iran has suspended oil supplies to Pakistan without providing any substantial evidence.
