{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support its existence as an actual law in Iowa. The majority of outlets sharing the claim fail to provide any evidence, and the web site Dumblaws.com, which is often cited, states that its content is for entertainment purposes only and not fact-checked.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the law prohibiting kissing for more than five minutes in Iowa is real, despite the lack of evidence. It is based on an assumption that such a law exists without proper verification.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides alternative explanations for the claim, suggesting that it originated on a joke web site and has been circulating as a \"dumb law\" for entertainment purposes. The lack of evidence and the difficulty in enforcing such a law also raise doubts about its existence."}
