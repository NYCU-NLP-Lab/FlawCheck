{"Understates": "The claim underestimates the impact of after-school programs on academic performance by stating that there is \"no demonstrable evidence\" of their effectiveness, while research shows that improvements in test scores can be modest but exist.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that after-school programs are not helping kids do better at school. The expert's verdict cites research studies that show some positive effects on test scores, but the claim does not acknowledge this evidence.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the sole purpose of after-school programs is to provide food for students who don't get fed at home. The expert's verdict highlights that these programs are mandated to provide academic programs, help with homework, and offer other educational activities.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim overlooks alternative explanations for the impact of after-school programs on academic performance. The expert's verdict mentions that regular attendance in these programs is necessary to see improvements in test scores, suggesting that factors such as student engagement and commitment play a role.", "Contradicts fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that research studies have shown a slight positive effect on test scores for students who participate in after-school programs. The expert's verdict provides evidence from the UCLA Center for Research on Evaluation, Standards and Student Testing's analysis.", "Exaggerates": "The claim exaggerates the lack of evidence by stating that there is \"no demonstrable evidence\" of after-school programs helping kids do better at school. The expert's verdict acknowledges that improvements in test scores can be modest, but still exist.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not considering the variations in results from place to place when evaluating the impact of after-school programs on academic performance. The expert's verdict mentions that results vary and improvements in test scores can be modest."}
