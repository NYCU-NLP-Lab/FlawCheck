{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which Delta Air Lines has broken promises to the people of Memphis. While there have been instances where Delta did not fulfill certain assurances, it is unclear if this constitutes a \"string of broken promises.\"", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the support Delta Air Lines initially had from the Memphis Airport Authority and the Memphis Chamber of Commerce during the merger with Northwest Airlines. This support suggests that Delta had some level of commitment to the region.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support in terms of concrete evidence or specific examples to substantiate the assertion that Delta Air Lines has broken promises. It relies mainly on the statement of one congressman without providing additional evidence.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the promises made by Delta Air Lines were clear and unambiguous. Without a clear definition of the promises made, it is difficult to determine if Delta has truly broken them.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for Delta's decisions to cut flights and raise fares in the region, such as changes in market demand or financial considerations. The claim does not explore these alternative explanations, which could provide a more nuanced understanding of the situation."}
