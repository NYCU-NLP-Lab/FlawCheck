{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates Mike Huckabee's support for \"taxpayer-funded scholarships for illegal aliens.\" The expert's verdict clarifies that Huckabee supported a measure that would have allowed the children of illegal aliens who graduated from Arkansas high schools to receive in-state tuition and apply for a state-funded scholarship program. It was not a direct support for scholarships specifically for illegal aliens.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it fails to provide detailed information about the specific actions taken by Mike Huckabee regarding the measure. The expert's verdict provides more context and clarifies the extent of Huckabee's support.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that supporting in-state tuition and state-funded scholarship programs for the children of illegal aliens equates to supporting \"taxpayer-funded scholarships for illegal aliens.\" This assumption overlooks the distinction between in-state tuition and direct scholarships.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Huckabee's support of the measure. The expert's verdict highlights Huckabee's reasoning for supporting the measure, which was to provide equal opportunities to children of illegal immigrants who had gone through the same education system as their peers."}
