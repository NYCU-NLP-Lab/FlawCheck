{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of abortion on the black population by stating that it has reduced by more than 25 percent since 1973, which is not supported by U.S. Census figures.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence and relies on imprecise data and guesstimates.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that every aborted fetus would have resulted in a live birth, which is considered oversimplified and inaccurate by social scientists.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim ignores other factors that could contribute to changes in the black population, such as birth rates, migration, and mortality rates."}
