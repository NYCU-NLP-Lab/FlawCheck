{"Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that no reporters have been able to reach the professor to clarify the content of the syllabus, suggesting a lack of supporting evidence for the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The expert's verdict suggests that the \"stress reduction policy\" allowing students to write their own grades was likely written in jest and meant to inspire discussion about fairness, implying that the claim may be based on a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The anonymous person described the professor as a tough professor who holds students to a high standard, suggesting that there may be an alternative explanation for the \"stress reduction policy\" mentioned in the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times because it is based on a single source (Campus Reform) and lacks additional verification or confirmation from other sources.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict mentions that the syllabi for the professor's classes available on the university's business school page do not contain the \"stress reduction policy,\" contradicting the claim that the professor allowed students to pick their own grades.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as an exaggeration of the actual policy mentioned in the syllabus, as it suggests that students were freely allowed to choose their grades, without any limitations or guidelines mentioned in the expert's verdict.", "Understate": "It is unclear if there is any understatement bias present in the claim, as the information provided does not indicate any deliberate downplaying of the situation."}
