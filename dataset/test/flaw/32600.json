{"Lack enough support": "The claim that walnuts, horse chestnuts, and the fruit from the Osage orange tree repel spiders lacks scientific evidence to back it up, as mentioned by multiple sources.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that spiders are repelled by the smell of these fruits, which implies that spiders can detect airborne scents. However, spiders actually interpret smells through touch, according to the Burke Museum of Natural History.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The Burke Museum of Natural History points out that house spiders don't enter homes from the outside, so placing these fruits on windowsills won't keep them away as they are already inside. Additionally, spiders in the wild do not seem to have an aversion to chestnuts, so it questions why they would avoid them inside a house."}
