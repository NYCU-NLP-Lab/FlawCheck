{"Exaggerate": "The claim of being \"totally exonerated\" is an exaggeration because the Department of Justice inspector general's report does not make any determination about the findings of the Mueller investigation.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the report only states that Comey was \"insubordinate\" and defied internal policy, but does not make any criminal charges against him.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support because it is not backed up by any evidence or findings from the inspector general's report.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that being \"totally exonerated\" by the inspector general's report would mean complete innocence, which is a problematic assumption as the report does not address all aspects of the Mueller investigation.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understating bias in the provided claim.", "Falters at times": "There is no evidence of faltering bias in the provided claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is no evidence of alternative explanation bias in the provided claim."}
