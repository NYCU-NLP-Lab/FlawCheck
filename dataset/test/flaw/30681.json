{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the situation by stating that a \"van full of illegals\" was caught voting at multiple Alabama polling locations. There is no evidence or proof provided to support this claim.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there is no State Election Integrity Board in Alabama, as confirmed by a spokesman for the Alabama Secretary of State. This undermines the credibility of the claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to substantiate the assertion that undocumented immigrants were caught voting at multiple Alabama polling locations. The article referenced in the claim is flagged as potentially fabricated and comes from a website that claims to be satire.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the article circulating on Facebook is true and accurate, without verifying the credibility or legitimacy of the source. This assumption is problematic as it relies on potentially unreliable information.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for any alleged irregularities in the voting process, such as errors or misunderstandings. It jumps to the conclusion that undocumented immigrants were responsible for the alleged fake votes without exploring other possibilities."}
