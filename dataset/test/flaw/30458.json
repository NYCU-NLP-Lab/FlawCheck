{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate Dan Forest's intentions by stating that he wants to use tax dollars specifically to help rich people send their kids to private school using vouchers. This could be an exaggeration of Forest's stance on modifying Opportunity Scholarships.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Dan Forest's support for eligibility expansion in the Opportunity Scholarships program means he wants to open it up to \"rich\" families. This assumption may not be supported by sufficient evidence.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough evidence or support to conclusively prove that Dan Forest wants to use tax dollars to help \"rich people\" send their kids to private school. It is based on statements made by Governor Roy Cooper during a debate and an online forum.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for Dan Forest's support for eligibility expansion in the Opportunity Scholarships program, such as improving access to education for all families, rather than specifically targeting \"rich\" families."}
