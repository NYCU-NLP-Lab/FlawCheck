{"Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict states that there is no federal ballistics information confirming that the bullet that killed the Border Patrol agent was fired from one of the guns involved in the federal arms trafficking operation.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the death of at least one U.S. Border Patrol agent was caused by weapons that were part of the federal arms trafficking operation, without providing sufficient evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the Border Patrol agent was shot during a firefight with a group of armed \"illegal aliens,\" suggesting that there could be alternative explanations for the agent's death, rather than solely attributing it to the federal arms trafficking operation."}
