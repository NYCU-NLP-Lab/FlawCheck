{"Understate": "The claim may understate the extent to which Chris Christie was behind in the polls against Jon Corzine during the 2009 governor's race. The expert's verdict states that Christie held significant leads over Corzine in early September, but the race became much tighter in its final weeks. This suggests that the claim may not fully capture the extent of Christie's deficit in the polls at certain points in the race.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to fully substantiate the assertion that Chris Christie was consistently behind in the polls against Jon Corzine. The expert's verdict mentions that in five of the 15 polls reviewed, Corzine held leads within the margins of error, while Christie held leads greater than the sampling errors in four polls. This indicates that the claim may not have enough evidence to establish a clear pattern of Christie being consistently behind.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim may overlook alternative explanations for the polling data. The expert's verdict mentions that an independent candidate, Chris Daggett, trailed both Christie and Corzine by wide margins in each poll. This suggests that the presence of an independent candidate could have influenced the polling dynamics and affected the perception of Christie being behind in the polls.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim may make a problematic assumption that being \"behind\" in the polls necessarily implies a significant deficit. The expert's verdict states that Christie's leads were typically minimal and fell within the polls' margins of error. This challenges the assumption that being behind in the polls indicates a substantial disadvantage for Christie.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent to which Chris Christie was behind in the polls against Jon Corzine. The expert's verdict mentions that Christie held leads in some polls and that the leads for both candidates were typically minimal and within the margins of error. This suggests that the claim may overstate the degree of Christie's deficit in the polls.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times in accurately representing the polling data. The expert's verdict mentions that Christie's lead had shrunk to 1 percent among likely voters in a poll released on Oct. 14, and Corzine took a five-point lead in a poll released on Oct. 28. This indicates that the claim may not consistently reflect the fluctuations in the polling numbers throughout the race.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not appear to contradict any established facts."}
