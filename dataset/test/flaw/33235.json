{"Understate": "The claim may understate the difference in per-pupil education spending between Rick Scott and Charlie Crist during the recession. The claim states that the difference is \"about $200 less,\" but the expert's analysis reveals a larger difference of $540.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to fully justify the $200 difference in per-pupil education spending. The expert's analysis provides more detailed information and context, showing that the difference is actually $540.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that per-pupil education spending is the sole indicator of a governor's commitment to education. However, the expert's analysis highlights other factors, such as changes in enrollment and overall budget cuts, that should be considered when evaluating the education spending records of Rick Scott and Charlie Crist.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the difference in per-pupil education spending. The expert's analysis mentions the loss of federal stimulus money as a contributing factor to the decrease in per-student dollars during Scott's administration."}
