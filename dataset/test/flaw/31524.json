{"Understate": "The claim states that the federal government has only balanced the budget five times in the last 50 years. However, the expert's verdict mentions that the federal government has actually achieved a budget surplus five times in the past 50 years, which could be seen as an understatement of the actual number of times the budget has been balanced.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it does not provide any evidence or data to back up the statement that the federal government has only balanced the budget five times in the last 50 years. The expert's verdict provides data from the White House Office of Management and Budget and the Congressional Budget Office to support the fact that the budget has been balanced five times.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why the budget has not been balanced more frequently. The expert's verdict mentions that the size of the federal budget makes it almost impossible to balance it with revenues, and that it has not happened in at least the last 110 years. This suggests that there may be structural or systemic factors that make balancing the budget challenging.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that balancing the budget is the only indicator of fiscal responsibility. However, the expert's verdict mentions that a budget is considered balanced when federal expenses equal federal revenues, but most people consider a budget balanced when revenues meet or exceed expenditures. This suggests that there may be different interpretations of what constitutes a balanced budget and fiscal responsibility.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the rarity of balancing the budget by stating that it has only happened five times in the last 50 years. The expert's verdict mentions that a 1998 study found that federal surpluses outnumbered deficits 108 to 100, with surpluses dominating in a large majority of the years prior to 1930. This suggests that balancing the budget has been more common in the past than the claim implies."}
