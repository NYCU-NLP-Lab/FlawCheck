{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the accusation against Jacob Blake by referring to him as a \"child rapist\" when there is no evidence to support this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the photo shows Jacob Blake's \"14-year-old rape victim.\"", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the photo depicts a girl who was assaulted by Jacob Blake, without any concrete evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for the photo, suggesting that it has been circulating online for more than a decade in the context of domestic violence, rather than sexual assault or child sexual assault."}
