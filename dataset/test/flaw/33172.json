{"Contradict fact": "The claim falsely suggests that images of the 90-year-old UK woman receiving the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine appeared online in a CNN news story in October. The expert's verdict contradicts this claim by providing evidence that the images were taken on December 8, 2020, and did not appear online before that date.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support its assertion that the images were published in a CNN news story in October. The expert's verdict provides evidence that the images were not published in earlier articles by CNN or any other news organization.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the images appearing online in October are the same as the images of Margaret Keenan receiving the vaccine on December 8. However, the expert's verdict explains that some news websites, including CNN, sometimes display the latest stories at the top of unrelated articles, leading to a misunderstanding.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim suggests a conspiracy theory that the story of the 90-year-old UK woman receiving the vaccine is not legitimate because the same images appeared online months earlier. However, the expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation that the images were not of the same event but were mistakenly associated due to the way news websites display articles."}
