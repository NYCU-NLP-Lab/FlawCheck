{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that San Francisco is registering \"illegal aliens\" to vote, implying that all non-citizens, regardless of immigration status, can register to vote in all elections. The expert's verdict clarifies that only some non-citizens, specifically parents, legal guardians, or caregivers of a child residing in San Francisco, can register to vote in local school board elections.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all non-citizens registering to vote are \"illegal aliens,\" which is a problematic assumption. The expert's verdict explains that the term \"non-citizen\" includes a broad range of individuals, from lawful permanent U.S. residents to undocumented immigrants.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up its assertion that San Francisco is registering \"illegal aliens\" to vote. The expert's verdict provides detailed information about the specific eligibility criteria and limitations on non-citizen voting in San Francisco, which contradicts the claim's unsupported statement.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that San Francisco is not allowing the non-citizen population at large to register to vote in all elections. The expert's verdict clarifies that the new law only allows some non-citizens to vote in local school board elections, specifically those who meet the eligibility criteria mentioned.", "Understate": "There is no significant evidence of understating bias in this particular claim."}
