{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the amount of taxes paid by undocumented immigrants. While the claim states that they pay $12 billion every year, it is not clear if this is an accurate or inflated figure.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all undocumented immigrants pay taxes, which may not be true. The Social Security Administration estimated that there were about 3.1 million unauthorized immigrants who worked and paid Social Security taxes in 2010, but this does not account for all undocumented immigrants.", "Lack enough support": "The claim relies on a note issued by the Social Security Administration in 2013 and a Vice News piece from 2014 to support the $12 billion figure. It is unclear if these sources provide enough evidence to support the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim suggests that undocumented immigrants are contributing to the tax system while Donald Trump is not. However, it does not consider alternative explanations for why Trump may not have paid federal income taxes, such as legal tax deductions or loopholes.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the potential benefits received by undocumented immigrants. The Social Security Administration subtracted about $1 billion in benefits that could have been received in 2010 from earnings in years when workers were unauthorized. This suggests that there may be additional benefits received by undocumented immigrants that are not accounted for in the claim."}
