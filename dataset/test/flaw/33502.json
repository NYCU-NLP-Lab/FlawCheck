{"Understate": "The claim understates the requirement of the original Royal Charter by implying that the Hudson's Bay Company makes annual payments of elk and beaver pelts to the Queen of England. In reality, the requirement was to provide two elk heads and two beaver pelts only when royalty visited the Rupert's Land area of Canada, not as an annual payment.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or sources to back up the statement about the annual payments of elk and beaver pelts.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the requirement of the original Royal Charter still applies and that the Hudson's Bay Company continues to make annual payments of elk and beaver pelts to the Queen of England. However, the expert's verdict states that this tradition has only been observed on three occasions when royalty traveled to Canada in the twentieth century.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the requirement of the original Royal Charter was not for annual payments, but rather for providing elk heads and beaver pelts when royalty visited the Rupert's Land area.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation to the claim could be that the tradition of providing elk and beaver pelts to royalty has been discontinued or modified over time, and the current practice of the Hudson's Bay Company may be different from the original requirement of the Royal Charter."}
