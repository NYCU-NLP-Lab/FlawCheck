{"Understate": "The claim may understate the fact that Lana Del Rey did not implement a wholesale ban on American flags at her concerts.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Lana Del Rey banned the American flag from her concerts solely because she can't stand to see it with President Trump in office, which may be a problematic assumption.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to conclusively prove that Lana Del Rey banned the American flag from her concerts solely because of President Trump.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Lana Del Rey stated she removed the American flag as the backdrop for one song and was reconsidering the use of flag imagery, but did not mention a ban on American flags.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for Lana Del Rey's decision to remove the American flag, such as her discomfort with current events in general, not just President Trump being in office."}
