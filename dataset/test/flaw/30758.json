{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates Hillary Clinton's support for the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) by stating that she called it \"the gold standard of trade deals\" and \"the finest deal you've ever seen.\" The expert's verdict provides evidence that Clinton did express support for the TPP, but does not confirm that she made these specific statements.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Clinton's previous support for the TPP contradicts her current stance. However, the expert's verdict explains that Clinton's support for the TPP changed after the negotiations were finalized, suggesting that her position evolved based on the final deal.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or sources to support the statement that Clinton called the TPP \"the gold standard.\" The expert's verdict provides quotes from Clinton's speeches, but they do not directly confirm the specific claim made.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Clinton's change in stance on the TPP. The expert's verdict provides information about Clinton's evolving position, but does not delve into potential reasons for her shift in support.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not accurately representing Clinton's evolving position on the TPP. The expert's verdict explains that Clinton initially supported the TPP but became disenchanted with it after the negotiations were completed. The claim fails to acknowledge this change in stance.", "Understate": "The claim understates the complexity of Clinton's position on the TPP by simplifying it to a single statement. The expert's verdict provides a more nuanced explanation of Clinton's support for the TPP at different stages and in different contexts.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Clinton did express support for the TPP, although the specific statements mentioned in the claim are not confirmed. The expert's verdict provides evidence of Clinton's support for the TPP but does not address the specific statements made in the claim."}
