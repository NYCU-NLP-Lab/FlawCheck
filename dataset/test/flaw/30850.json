{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the average E.R. wait time in California by stating it as 5 hours, without specifying the specific measurement being used.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a tweet from the Republican National Committee chairman and a report from a local TV station, rather than a comprehensive study or data.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Obamacare is solely responsible for the long E.R. wait times in California, without considering other factors that may contribute to the issue.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the long E.R. wait times in California, such as population growth, insufficient healthcare resources, or other systemic issues.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the alleged 5-hour wait time was measured before the health care law took effect, suggesting that Obamacare may not be directly responsible for the wait times.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the actual average E.R. wait times in California by only considering one measurement (patient arrival to being admitted to hospital as inpatient) that is longer than other measurements.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not providing a clear definition of \"average E.R. wait\" and failing to consider the different measurements and their implications."}
