{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the difference in infrastructure spending between the United States, China, and India. While the claim states that China and India are spending 10% of their GDP on infrastructure, the sources mentioned in the expert's verdict provide figures of 9% for China and a goal of 10% for India in the future.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific data or sources to support the claim that the United States is only spending 2% of its GDP on infrastructure. The expert's verdict mentions that they were not able to find all three countries' data for a single year, making direct comparisons difficult.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that a higher percentage of GDP spent on infrastructure automatically leads to better outcomes or competitiveness. This assumption may not take into account other factors such as the efficiency of spending, the quality of infrastructure projects, or the specific needs and priorities of each country.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the difference in infrastructure spending between the United States, China, and India. Factors such as population size, economic priorities, government policies, and historical infrastructure development may contribute to the varying levels of investment in infrastructure."}
