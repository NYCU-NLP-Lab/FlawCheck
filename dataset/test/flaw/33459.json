{"Lack enough support": "The claim that \"the odds are pretty high they're going to keep the baby\" lacks sufficient evidence or data to support it.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that seeing an ultrasound will significantly influence a woman's decision to keep the baby, without considering other factors that may contribute to the decision.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the impact of ultrasounds on women seeking an abortion by implying that it will almost always lead to a decision to keep the baby.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in acknowledging that not all women seeking an abortion are influenced in the same way by ultrasounds, and individual reactions may vary.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why women may change their mind after seeing an ultrasound, such as emotional or personal factors unrelated to the ultrasound itself."}
